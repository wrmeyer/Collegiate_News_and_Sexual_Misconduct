University of Wisconsin released data Monday, Sept. 21, showing nearly 28 percent of undergraduate females reported experiencing sexual assault involving force or Read…Kowalik echoed recent revelations that one out of every four women at Wisconsin will find themselves victims of sexual assault. That number, which is taken from a survey conducted by the university, does not represent all forms of assault, such as stalking and harassment.It’s On Us plans on helping students be more aware of sexual assault on campus through a series of short films. These feature films will be played at Wisconsin’s homecoming game this Saturday and will also be made available on social media.UW athletes take stand against sexual assault
In a two minute YouTube video, four University of Wisconsin varsity athletes took a stand and raised their voice against Read…Athletes like Brown are joining Kowalik to help raise awareness to the issue. Kowalik said using role models such as Brown will help people to see the seriousness of the issue.Brown said he’s happy to join the cause and believes it’s a good way to help give visibility to the issue.The issue is also something that is close to Brown, who revealed he has friends that have been victims of sexual assault.“It’s just not OK to take advantage of women in that way,” Brown said.One of the other goals of It’s On Us is to educate students on the process of reporting sexual assault on campus. National studies have shown only 12 percent of assaults on college campuses are reported, and Kowalik believes one of the reasons so many cases go unreported is due to the stigma that comes with the reporting process for sexual assault.Kowalik said even something as simple as bringing awareness to this cause will help reduce the number of sexual assaults on campus.There are numerous resources available to students on campus if they have been the victim of sexual assault, including confidential reporting services, counseling and the National Sexual Assault Hotline that is open 24 hours. The number for the hotline is 800-656-4673.","UW-Madison, Athletic Department announce partnership with “It’s On Us” campaign to stop sexual assault",UWM

Cephus led the team in receiving touchdowns with six across 10 games.Football: Badgers fall flat in second half, lose to The Ohio State University in Big Ten Championship
The No. 8 University of Wisconsin football team (10-3, 7-3 Big Ten) lost 34–21 against No. 1 The Ohio State Read…After missing the entire 2018 season, Cephus returned for the 2019 season and didn’t miss a beat, emerging as the team’s go-to target in the passing game.Cephus led the team in nearly every receiving category, including receptions (59), yards (901), receiving yards per reception (15.3) and receiving touchdowns (7) as he played in all 14 games.Cephus also played his best in big games against the Ohio State University in the Big Ten Championship (seven receptions for 122 yards) and Minnesota in the last game of the regular season (five receptions for 114 yards and a touchdown). He ended his Wisconsin career with seven catches for 59 yards and a touchdown against Oregon in the Rose Bowl.Head Coach Paul Chryst also credited Cephus for being a great teammate during his time with the Badgers.“He’s selfless. I think he’s an unbelievable teammate because one, he truly cares about the guys, each individual,” Chryst said in an interview with the Wisconsin State Journal. “He’ll do anything for them, he’s open to them, he’s got enough awareness that he kind of sees when someone’s working through something. He’s got a spirit about him. He’s got an infectious personality. He will find the good in people. When you get on the field, he loves playing the game and appreciates that opportunity to play the game and I think that’s infectious.”While Cephus proved doubters wrong at Wisconsin, the question now is whether or not his success will translate to the next level as an NFL wide receiver.Football: Return of Cephus brings vitality to Badger air attack
Before the 2019 season began, Badger fans knew little of what they could expect from newly reinstated junior wide receiver Read…Let’s take a look at Cephus’ draft stock with the NFL Scouting Combine and NFL Draft quickly approaching.As you can see from the above stats, Quintez Cephus performed at a high-level during his junior season at Wisconsin. But, many scouts are concerned that his playmaking ability isn’t there and he won’t be dynamic enough to perform consistently at the NFL level.While scouts have every right to be concerned about Cephus’ abilities, some of the worries associated with Cephus’ play can be attributed to shaky, inconsistent performances from Wisconsin’s quarterbacks in Alex Hornibrook (2017) and Jack Coan (2019).Paired up with an NFL-level quarterback, Cephus could be a great fit for teams in need of receiving help in the league.Football: Badgers dismantle Minnesota, win Big Ten West
The No. 12 University of Wisconsin football team (10-2, 7-2 Big Ten) defeated the No. 8 Minnesota Golden Gophers (10-2, Read…If Cephus wants to make good on his potential, he will also need to work on improving his ability to run crisp routes, as he isn’t what you could consider a receiver with elite speed compared to many NFL counterparts.As an average-sized receiver measuring in at 6 feet 1 inch tall and 207 pounds, Cephus might need to beef up in the gym before the draft as most physically dominant wide receivers in the NFL today weigh 10 to 15 pounds more than Cephus.While Cephus’ on-field abilities come into question among NFL draft scouts, so do potential off-field character issues.Cephus missed all of the 2018 season due to two sexual assault charges raised against him at UW, both of which he was ultimately acquitted of. Despite this, Cephus has not had any other off-field issues — legal or otherwise — during his time at Wisconsin.Still, Cephus will certainly be questioned about the incident during meetings with NFL scouts during the NFL Combine and Wisconsin’s Pro Day, and it will likely have an impact on his draft stock as well.Football: Look at Jonathan Taylor’s draft stock before NFL Draft
Running back Jonathan Taylor has been a crucial piece of Wisconsin’s offense for the past three seasons, making the decision Read…Right now, most mock drafts from around the sports world have Cephus as a Day 3 (rounds 4-7) pick, with a few drafts even listing Cephus as an undrafted free agent following the conclusion of the draft.With a strong performance at the NFL Combine (Feb. 23 through March 2) and Wisconsin’s Pro Day (likely at some point in March), Cephus could easily find himself as a middle-round pick going to a team looking for a No. 2 or No. 3 option in the passing game.Keep an eye on Cephus as the NFL Draft approaches, as he just might surprise everyone and compete with decent speed (4.5 second 40-yard dash time according to the Wisconsin State Journal) and great hands during his prove-it opportunities in February and March.NFL Draft Projection: 5th-6th Round",Football: Look at Quintez Cephus’ draft stock before NFL Draft,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/sports/2018/10/16/in-year-of-change-for-badger-receiving-game-jake-ferguson-has-been-safety-valve/,"Oct 16, 2018","Jake Ferguson has already been turning heads in just his first season as a redshirt freshman for the University of Wisconsin football team. The tight end is second on the Badgers in receiving yards and tied for first in touchdowns.After losing their primary passing option, tight end Troy Fumagalli, to the NFL last year, the University of Wisconsin football team began the season unsure who their next receiving threat would be. With Quintez Cephus departing the program amid sexual assault allegations from July and Danny Davis being suspended two games for his involvement in the incident the team also lost two of their top three wide receivers in yards, receptions and touchdowns to start the year.In total, this represented 1,466 yards and 55 percent total receiving yardage that the Badgers would need to replace. In terms of scoring Fumagalli, Cephus and Davis caught 15 of the Badgers 25 passing touchdowns. If you exclude Davis, who returned in week three, those numbers drop to 1,048 yards and 39 percent of the receiving game and 10 of Wisconsin’s 25 passing touchdowns.Football: Zander Neuville suffers season ending injury
Wisconsin Badgers tight end Zander Neuville is likely to miss the remainder of the season after suffering a serious left Read…With such a large portion of their offense missing Wisconsin would need to be creative in finding options for quarterback Alex Hornibrook to get the ball to. Though wide receiver A.J. Taylor has unsurprisingly led the team in receiving yards and touchdowns, Ferguson’s involvement in the offense has surprised Badger fans and outsiders alike.The tight end currently has 259 receiving yards and two touchdowns, placing him second in both categories. His biggest game so far was in a tight contest at Iowa where Ferguson stepped up for 58 yards and a score in the tight 28–17 contest.Much of this early success can be credited to the chemistry he and Hornibrook have developed both on and off the field with the two texting regularly.“He’s texting me all throughout the night — actually texted me last night at 12 and I’m usually in bed by 10. He texted me multiple times ‘Jake, Jake wake up. You’re gonna have a lot of these looks.’ It’s kind of annoying at sometimes when I’m trying to sleep but at the same time it’s good to have that.”Ferguson’s comments came after Hornibrook found the tight end in the end zone during the 41–24 rout of Nebraska.Football: Badgers season hinges on Saturday’s appointment with Wolverines
The No. 15 University of Wisconsin Badgers (4–1, 2–0 Big Ten) will face their season-defining match-up at the Big House Read…After the game, Hornibrook responded to Ferguson’s comments about the developing relationship between the tight end and quarterback.“He’s always talking about my texts,” said Hornibrook. “He did a great job winning in one on one situations. That’s something I can count on him to do and he did a great job today getting open.”What is perhaps most shocking about Ferguson’s rise is how he stayed so under the radar despite his athleticism at the tight end position. Going into Wisconsin’s first game against Western Kentucky, Ferguson wasn’t even listed on the two-deep depth chart.In a conversation with tight end coach Mickey Turner in February he mentioned only Zander Neuville and Kyle Penniston by name as the two players that would take over at tight end, though Turner did mention there were some freshmen he had high expectations for.Despite exceeding early expectations, Ferguson still has areas of his game he needs to improve. Though he has been exceptional in his route running and reliability as a receiver Ferguson’s blocking can still keep him off the field at times. And with Neuville, the Badgers leading blocker at tight end, suffering a season-ending injury the pressure will only be greater for Ferguson to develop those skills.Football: Takeaways from “ground em’ pound em” victory at Camp Randall
Saturday night the Wisconsin Badgers met the Nebraska Cornhuskers for what should have been a marquee matchup, hampered by the Read…Though Neuville didn’t often show up in the box score as a receiver, his blocking abilities were enough to put him on the John Mackey Award watch list this season. Both the Badger coaches and Ferguson realize these are large, but necessary shoes to fill if they want to maintain the same level of offensive production.“[Neuville] was a monster in the blocking game really could do everything,” said Ferguson. “So when he went down early last week it was Coach Turner’s message we really need to step up and take on those roles.”While Ferguson still has a ways to go in becoming an every-down player, his performance so far puts him in an excellent position to become the next great Badger tight end.","In year of change for Badger receiving game, Jake Ferguson has been safety valve",UWM

At the heart of their current and prospective success is redshirt freshman Scott Nelson.Nelson bears the same name as the Badger safety who helped Wisconsin win the 1993 Big Ten Championship. Today’s Scott Nelson, and the rest of the Badgers, have similar aspirations after two straight losses in the conference championship game.A native of Detroit, Nelson credits his parents and defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard for his ability to take on a powerful leadership role so early in his college football career.“One of the things my parents always tried to instill with me was be a leader growing up. [I’m] young but Coach Leonhard always says you don’t have to be an old guy to be a leader,” Nelson said. “If you’re dependable and people can count on you … people will follow you.”Football: BYU shocks UW 24–21 at home, Gaglianone’s last-minute FG sails left
Wisconsin’s non-conference schedule had been repeatedly criticized as lenient — no team as good as the Badgers should be facing Read…Perhaps another reason Nelson has earned the respect of his defensive teammates so early is his relationship with fellow safety D’Cota Dixon. While the two became friends through a bible study group Dixon leads, they’ve since worked to create the same chemistry on the football field.In an offseason interview with the Wisconsin State Journal Nelson described the routine he and Dixon generated in preparing for the 2018 season.“[Dixon and I] always go up to Coach Leonhard’s office, probably four or five times a week,” Nelson said. “We’ll watch old games. I can’t tell you how many times we watched [last year’s] Ohio State game. We watched that one probably 15, 20 times.”But Dixon isn’t the only teammate Nelson has made an impression on. In their postgame interviews following the week two victory over New Mexico, several defensive players, including linebacker TJ Edwards, praised Nelson’s early success.“Anytime you get turnovers, that’s what you want to do and [Nelson’s] always around the ball making plays,” Edwards said.Men’s soccer: Badgers look to upset No. 2 Hoosiers at home
It’s been a precarious start to the season for the University of Wisconsin men’s soccer team (2–3–1) as they’ve had Read…Week two was Nelson’s most successful game of the season to this point. Against the Lobos, he recorded four tackles on the team’s opening drive and notched a red zone interception after reading the quarterback Sheriron Jones and cutting off the throw.Head Coach Paul Chryst praised Nelson’s late game heroics, calling it the turning point of the game. But Nelson had a more humble view of the play, giving credit to his teammates on the offensive side of the football.“For me, I would say the turning point was when the offense got rolling. They started getting touchdowns [Jonathan Taylor] was getting touchdowns, [Taiwan Deal] was getting rolling, [AJ Taylor], [Hornibrook] they were all playing really well,” said Nelson. “We can get some stops, but once they started scoring touchdowns we really got into a rhythm.”Nelson’s interception came at the start of the second half when the team led by a slim 10–7 margin. The Wisconsin offense rode this momentum in route to outscoring Mexico 35–7 the rest of the game.Football: Danny Davis returns as Badgers take on BYU
Sophomore receiver Danny Davis will return Saturday after his involvement in a sexual assault case resulted in his two-game suspension. Read…Nelson’s success was also apparent in the week one contest versus Western Kentucky where the safety racked up seven tackles and two pass deflections in his first ever game playing at Wisconsin. One of those deflections was also a dropped interception for Nelson which could have boosted his early stats even more.In the recent loss against BYU, Nelson was quieter, notching only five tackles and one pass deflection. But this was not entirely the safety’s fault as BYU relied more heavily on the run to gain the win, quarterback Tanner Magnum threw for just 89 yards on the day.Looking at these three games, Nelson’s statistics put him at the top of the Badger’s defense. A reliable stopper, he’s currently second on the team with 16 tackles to Dixon’s 18.Nelson also leads the team early with an interception and three pass deflections. But with only a small sample size so far, we’ll have to see if his ball-hawking abilities can persist against tougher Big Ten competition.Wisconsin and Nelson will look to move forward Saturday at Iowa as the team opens conference play.","Football: Meet Wisconsin’s newest defensive star, Scott Nelson",UWM

There, they arrested the suspect, Robin Perkins, 34, and took him into custody at Dane County Jail. Perkins was charged with third-degree sexual assault, misdemeanor bail jumping and two counts of felony bail jumping.Perkins is a former UW student but is not affiliated with UW, according to the UWPD.UWPD Communications Director Marc Lovicott said the department received a phone call from a victim early Tuesday morning informing them that an assault had occurred.“We responded immediately and immediately took the suspect into custody,” Lovicott said.According to Lovicott, Perkins had previously been arrested but had posted bail and was therefore released. He then violated his bail conditions, leading to the extra charges of bail jumping, Lovicott said.In these cases, he was charged with second-degree sexual assault on an unconscious person, disorderly conduct and exposure. Perkins’ previous cases are still open — meaning that he is presumed innocent.The cases took place between August and November 2021, according to the CCAP.This sexual assault occurred in the Eagle Heights community, which is mostly graduate student housing, University Housing Marketing and Communications Director Brendon Dybdahl said in an email statement to The Badger Herald. Eagle Heights lies in the northwest corner of the UW campus.“Housing works closely with UHS Survivor Services, the Sexual Misconduct Reporting and Resource Program, the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards and UWPD to provide support to survivors and hold perpetrators accountable,” Dybdahl said. “We encourage anyone on campus who experiences sexual assault to seek support.”Dybdahl said the UW Office of Compliance offers a campus resource guide as a good place to start for those seeking support.Perkins was released from the Dane County Jail on Thursday, according to the police report.

https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2021/09/28/uw-expands-sexual-assault-services-to-uhs-campus-rape-culture-persists/,"Sep 28, 2021","University of Wisconsin recently took steps to improve the ability of survivors of sexual assault to access an appointment with a forensic nurse on campus. But, the work to strive for a campus climate that prevents assault and provides holistic post-assault support to survivors is not over.Beginning this semester, students will have the option to schedule an appointment with a forensic nurse at University Health Services following an assault because of a partnership with local nonprofit, DaneMAC. A victim’s advocate will be on hand during each appointment to ensure that the survivor has emotional support and a knowledgeable source of their options and rights following an assault.Prior to this move, UW students had to commute to the only place in Dane County that offered forensic tests, or “rape kits,” for sexual assault — the UnityPoint Health-Meriter Hospital.Though the hospital is not far south of campus, having to go to the emergency room in a new building off campus may be discouraging or intimidating for survivors seeking a forensic exam.In UW’s participation in the 2019 Association of American Universities survey, AAU reported that less than a third of respondents were aware of the services available at Meriter.This raises the question: How do we create a campus environment where survivors are encouraged and supported in their experience with post-assault services?UHS collaborative effort with UW Housing, UWPD step in right direction addressing mental health crisis
Working under extreme stress with disrupted sleep schedules, interpersonal relationships, eating and exercise habits — not to mention the distance Read…This resource expansion was made possible by UW professor Kate Walsh, who received a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice for the purpose of expanding post-assault services to students. Walsh is head of the Sexual Violence Research Initiative, which researches psychological and societal aspects of sexual violence, as well as policy related to preventing sexual violence.Approximately 26% of female undergraduates at UW report experiencing sexual assault on the UW-campus, and 11% have reported being raped. These numbers demonstrate just how present rape culture is at UW.Women are not the only ones to experience sexual assault, and it is estimated that the vast majority of cases go unreported across the board — about 87% of assaults on college campuses.Adding forensic nurses to UHS services is a good development, but the program is not perfect. For starters, UHS will only be offering services during business hours on weekdays. Forensic exams need to occur within days of an assault.This means that a student who is assaulted on a Friday night may still have to go to the off-campus hospital on Saturdays and Sundays to receive an exam as soon as possible.DaneMAC co-founder Rachel Sattler said in a Wisconsin State Journal article that finding support following an assault is more difficult than one would think.“Most survivors that we talk to and work with in our day jobs say navigating the support systems can be as traumatic as the assault itself,” Sattler said.What You Should Know About Stalking on Campus
[The following is sponsored letter. Trigger Warning: Contains descriptions of stalking and stalking behaviors] I am going to start by Read…Guaranteeing a representative from the Rape Crisis Center at every exam means students will have someone on hand who can answer questions while ensuring confidentiality. It allows for misconceptions to be corrected, like the false but widely believed ideas that going to receive a forensic exam will show up on a parent’s insurance bill, or that a survivor must file a police-report in order to receive an exam.Every survivor has a different story that is their own to share if and when they choose to do so, so it is hard to say definitively whether or not this move will help more survivors report their experience to UW.But, improving access to forensic exams sends a positive message to survivors on campus in a time when the number of assaults that go unreported demonstrates that they feel generally unsupported by the university.The fact that there has only been one program like this in all of Dane County until this point is indicative of the incredible lack of support survivors face. This action will encourage survivors on campus to seek help by demonstrating the University’s initiative to make it easier for student’s to access resources while giving them the freedom to choose whether or not they file a report with the university or with the police.Though adding forensic nurses to the campus clinic will provide much needed support to survivors, the policy fails to address the root of the problem — the prevalence of sexual assault on the UW campus.UW, professors must support students’ mental health beyond words of advice
It goes without saying this past academic year has been unlike any other. Since March 2020, when University of Wisconsin Read…Studies have found that active bystander intervention is one of the best ways to actually prevent sexual assault from happening in the first place.Creating a safer campus is not something that happens overnight, and there is no single solution. It will take years of work from dedicated faculty and students committed to creating a safer campus for everyone.One of the biggest fears that survivors face is not being believed and being denied their right to resources that will help them. Survivors of assault continue to be discouraged by infamous stories such as Brock Turner and other rapists who are let off the hook and not held accountable.This is a positive initiative that makes it easier for survivors to access forensic testing exams, but UW needs to continue expanding access to these services by offering weekend appointments on campus and making these services more widely known.If you or someone you know is a survivor of sexual assault and is looking for support services, call the national sexual assault hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or visit https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/survivor-resources/ for campus resources.Leah Terry (lmterry@wisc.edu) is a junior majoring in political science and communication arts and pursuing a certificate in public policy.","UW expands sexual assault services to UHS, campus rape culture persists",UWM

Meanwhile in Madison, a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin obtained funding for expanded survivor services, and the student government passed legislation to create an anti-violence coordinator position.In November, two sexual assault kit bills part of a bipartisan proposal passed in the Wisconsin State Senate, which would set a timeline for sexual assault kit collection processing and storage and create a kit tracking system. After partisan strife, the legislation headed to Governor Tony Evers’ desk to be signed into law.Under the new legislation, sexual assault survivors who want to report their assault are required to go to a health care professional who has to notify law enforcement within 24 hours or send it to state crime laboratories within 72 hours if the survivor does not want to report the crime. Police must also send the kit into the state crime laboratories for testing by the police within two weeks, according to Wisconsin Public Radio.UW sends out campus climate survey to understand student experiences based on identities, background
The University of Wisconsin sent out a campus climate survey Tuesday afternoon to learn more about students’ experiences on campus. Read…The bill aims to make the process more streamlined to prevent a backlog of untested sexual assault kits across Wisconsin, which was found to be the case in 2014. The backlog of 6,000 untested kits took four years to be eliminated, according to Wisconsin Public Radio.For Madison residents, the Dane County Multi-Agency Center has centralized resources and information for sexual assault survivors making access easier. Their platform helps survivors through vulnerable times as they look for advocacy in filing police reports or finding transportation to the single hospital in Dane country that performs comprehensive forensic sexual exams — Unity Point Health-Meriter hospital in downtown Madison.For students at the University of Wisconsin, University Health Services started a forensic nurse examiner’s program in partnership with the Dane County Multi-Agency Center. The program was started with money from a two-year grant from the Office of Victims of Crime.According to Kate Walsh, an associate professor of Gender and Women’s Studies and Psychology who obtained the money to expand survivor services and advocacy at UW, other campuses and data show that students are asking for a nurse examiner’s program at UW.“They don’t want to go to lots of different places to get all of their different needs met, they don’t want to have to keep retelling their story over and over again, not knowing how the person on the other end is going to respond to them,” Walsh said.Starting in the fall of 2021, students could schedule an appointment through UHS where they could be seen by a forensic nurse at the campus health clinic where an advocate will be present to explain and answer questions about the exam and additional resources.From two surveys conducted at UW in 2015 and then 2019, 1 in 4 undergraduate women said they had experienced non-consensual sexual contact in their college career, but few reported or sought resources after the crime. Despite the success of Walsh’s programs, she says UW still has low reporting rates.Walsh and other advocacy organizations on campus are launching an awareness campaign next semester to publicize DaneMAC and the forensic nurses available on campus. Since the program’s soft launch, Walsh saw students make use of the program and many said they would not have traveled to Meriter hospital to get the exam done.UHS played a collaborative role in implementing the program and has assigned half-time employees to assist the coordinator up if they are seeing another student — ensuring all student needs are met. Walsh said she has been happy with how UW has responded to the program.“It’s important that when you have a forensic exam, you also have access to an advocate who can help explain the different parts of the exam so that the survivor can choose what parts they want and what parts they don’t,” Walsh said.Dane County Board passes 2022 budget with $7 million hike on original proposal

Tritz said there should be more people supporting legislative change such as better accommodation systems and advocates for survivors, more survivor services, expanded mental health appointment availability, increased diversity and training for students on how to adequately respond to situations involving sexual violence.In an email statement to The Herald, UW spokesperson Meredith McGlone said each campus unit working in violence prevention has “incredibly dedicated” staff members who regularly seek ways to improve and advocate for and with students. Many of these staff members work directly with student organizations, forming partnerships critical to continuing UW’s progress in moving to a violence-free campus, McGlone added.Reonda Washington, a violence prevention specialist at UHS, conducted Color of Drinking survey in 2018 according to which alcohol is the “#1 date-rape drug” at UW. There is growing consensus that sexual violence is not restricted to business hours and on-campus spaces.“We’re one of the top party schools in the nation, and we have a serious problem with alcohol culture on campus,” Tritz said.Students still face barriers trying to access forensic nurses because UHS is not open overnight. In these cases, students still have to go to Meriter hospital — located past Ogg residential hall — rather than UHS.Promoting Awareness and Victim Empowerment at UW, or PAVE-UW, started an activism campaign this semester for increased funding for survivor advocacy and services at UW. In their petition to the UW administration, PAVE-UW said that with more money, Survivor Services could expand its hours of availability and increase crisis support services.UW Gender & Women’s Studies grad students start GoFundMe to help pay segregated fees

Things don’t stop here as we need to make sure  other pieces of our judicial system are operating well and treating our students well by seeing their cases through to the end.”Walsh said she hopes her success will encourage UW to allocate more money for these resources. The recent legislation passed by ASM will also continue to establish long-term resources for survivors at UW.","Increasing survivor advocacy at state legislature, UW but advocates say expanded services needed",UWM

The 2015 film, ‘Spotlight’, is based on the true story of the priests in Boston who sexually abused children.Spotlight is a group of investigative journalists at the Boston Globe. In 2002, they exposed a Catholic church scandal which involved about 90 priests within the Archdiocese molesting children. This is a true story.Exclusive: Bob Odenkirk talks his new movie “Nobody”
Last week, The Badger Herald joined a group of college publications from across the country in sittin down to a Read…The movie starts with two policemen talking about the arrest of John Geoghan, a high-ranking clergy member of the Catholic Church repeatedly accused of sexual assault and the subject of the Spotlight investigation. The arrest was hushed for publicity reasons before Geoghan was released. From this, we can see the impact and the corruption of Catholic churches — high clergies are not held accountable for crimes.The movie stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci, all extremely famous and highly skilled. From the quality of the cast, the viewer gets an insight into the caliber of the whole production.Each of the actors depicts the emotions and the intensity of the situation accurately. Mark Ruffalo as Mike Rezendes reflects the importance of persistence and precision to investigative journalists. In a handful of scenes, he continuously “bothers” the lawyer who represented the victims in the previous cases and asks tough questions.Michael Keaton plays Robby, who led the Spotlight team. He perfectly exhibits guilt and anger after his character realizes he ignored a clip related to this scandal years ago and plays up the character’s determination when asking confirmation from an inside source.Rachel McAdams as Sasha Pfeiffer displays a character sympathetic toward survivors and strong when facing obstacles. When one victim broke down sharing their traumatic experience, her character kept comforting him. When Pfeiffer could not get answers from the church’s lawyer, she kept asking questions and insisted on finding more information.‘Godzilla vs. Kong’: a great monster movie that doesn’t try to be anything else
I have always believed that a movie should be judged based on what it is trying to be. No one Read…These three characters all displayed one common theme — the importance and necessity of investigative journalism. No one would have known about the scandal if it were not for the Spotlight team.Another thing I want to highlight relates to the interactions between the journalists, the victims, the church and the lawyers. The movie illustrated how to interview victims with sympathy and the church with “hostility” and fearlessness.In addition to the cast, the movie also shows how these journalists paid attention to trivial details, were quick on their feet and coordinated their strategy accordingly. They found the pattern of the involved priests and began their investigation. All of these are important features of an investigative journalist and it was portrayed perfectly in the movie.As the movie progresses, the persistence and the precision of the Spotlight pays off and eventually exposes about 90 priests who abused children. After the Spotlight article published in 2002, more scandals came to light — not only in the United States, but around the world.Review of opened movie theaters with Christopher Nolan’s ‘Tenet’
After debuting in 70 countries Aug. 26, Director Christopher Nolan’s highly-anticipated 10th feature film “Tenet” finally reached the U.S., making Read…As a biographical drama, the movie certainly exaggerated some scenes as all movies or shows do. But, the takeaway is as journalists or staff members of a newspaper, whether it is a student or a commercial one, we bear a social responsibility to expose wrongdoings.In the world we live today, so many injustices are unreported and those people involved think they are above the law. ‘Spotlight’ showed us they are not and this is why we need investigative journalism.If you are a current journalism student and someone who is interested in becoming a journalist or want to be involved in the news industry, I highly recommend this movie for its accuracy and the way it showcases what it is like to be an investigative journalist.",‘Spotlight’ illustrates the importance of investigative journalism during Sexual Assault Awareness Month,UWM

Obuseh’s post came right after the forum and condemned anyone claiming “to be ‘survivors’ of sexual abuse when they aren’t, or using it to humanize themselves or gain empathy.”Following Obuseh’s Facebook status, Bennett released a statement saying the post was directed at her.“I’m saddened and appalled by anyone, let alone my opponent, gaslighting my experiences as a survivor,” Bennett said. “1 in 4 women at UW have experienced sexual assault, yet only 1 in 11 cases are reported.

One in four women report being sexually assaulted in their lifetime. Applied to our campus, that’s 26% of students.

The National Guard Bureau is a federal agency that oversees state National Guards.The Cap Times reported sexual assault was not officially listed as a crime in the WCMJ until 2014.UW System will comply with new Title IX rules for sexual assault

Tony Evers urged legislators to update the WCMJ to meet federal military law standards. Rep. Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, expects lawmakers to update the WCMJ by next year, and said the state legislature should do everything in its power to protect those who serve our state.Wisconsin National Guard deputy director of public affairs Major Joe Trovato says the Guard supports working with the legislature to update the WCMJ.“The Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs has had discussions with leaders in state government about updating the Wisconsin Code of Military Justice to better align with the Uniform Code of Military Justice [the code that governs federal military law],” Trovato said. “Those discussions are still preliminary in nature, however, we remain committed to working with both the governor’s office and the legislature to seek updates to the WCMJ.”While the laws within the WCMJ have yet to be changed, the Wisconsin National Guard itself made some changes. According to Spectrum News 1, the Guard assigned a sexual assault response coordinator in light of recent criticism.Trovato said SARCs have participated in all U.S. military organizations since 2005. Trovato said a state-level SARC oversees the implementation of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program. A state-level SARC also trains lower-level SARCs within the national guard and provides sexual assault education for troops.UW’s Sexual Harassment Policy remains relatively unchanged despite shifting Title IX regulations

According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Master Sgt. Jay Ellis of the Wisconsin Air National Guard reported multiple instances of sexual assault of female guard members. Ellis alleged his commanders tried to discharge him from the Guard and get rid of his retirement benefits in retaliation.Ellis said the Guard asked him to move his gear out of his locker and attempted to use past medical issues as reasoning for his discharge. Ellis said he didn’t know who to trust during this time. Nevertheless, Ellis’s complaints about sexual assault prompted multiple federal investigations into the Wisconsin Air National Guard.Trovato said the Wisconsin National Guard doesn’t conduct its own investigations into sexual assault. Instead, cases are reported to local and state law enforcement or the Wisconsin Department of Justice.Trovato spoke on past sexual assault cases regarding the DOJ.“DOJ is doing a second check to see if any cases are ripe for reconsideration [or] referral to local [district attorneys] for prosecution,” Trovato said. “Civilian authorities have jurisdiction in these matters and would be the prosecuting agencies from a criminal perspective.”District 8 Alder candidates conflict over statement denying sexual assault survivorship

The Wisconsin Committee on Universities and Technical Colleges held a hearing regarding Critical Race Theory’s role in higher education Wednesday, Read…In the letter, Vos said UW allowed UHS to “push their own political beliefs and agenda on its graduate students” by mandating the course.“It is unacceptable that the University of Wisconsin–Madison requires graduate students to take a mandatory class that instills the university’s negative opinion of white students and the idea that students should feel guilty simply because of their race,” Vos wrote in the letter.Critical race theory is a school of thought among legal scholars based on the idea that race is socially constructed to oppress and exploit BIPOC people, according to Britannica.Vos argues in the letter the course emphasizes critical race theory and critical race feminism as the means to force students to “agree that whiteness means privilege.” Vos said the course labels certain identity groups as privileged, including white people, men, Christians, U.S. citizens and able-bodied people.UW spokesperson John Lucas said the course is devoted to preventing sexual violence and misconduct, and critical race theory is not a focus of the course.UW professors discuss the role of critical race theory in classes, the political arena

Blank said referencing certain ideas doesn’t equate to telling students they have to believe in those ideas.“It is no different from asking students to take a quiz on Keynesian or Marxian economic theories; we want to ensure they understand the concepts, but we do not require them to agree with either theory,” Blank stated.Vos has previously voiced his disagreement with the ideas of critical race theory. Other Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin, like State Rep.

If you have been sexually assaulted, or are not sure, there are several ways to get support. View options on campus through University Health Services.A 45-year-old mother from Minneapolis smiles down at her two young children. She feels content, secure and fortunate — all feelings she knows she wouldn’t have felt if she chose to have her child when she got pregnant at 18.For the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity and will be referred to as Sally, having a baby at 18 was not an option. She was in an unhealthy relationship with someone she saw no future with and knew she did not want her child to grow up in a dysfunctional environment. The option to have an abortion was available to her, and she gratefully utilized it.“I wasn’t gonna have a baby at that time, that was clear to me,” Sally said. “It was a relief that I had an option.”Sally frequently reflects on the meaning of choice. As someone who was adopted, she can see her biological mother’s choice in herself. After dealing with the aftermath of an abortion, she can appreciate the emotional toll of adoption.In both situations — abortion and adoption — a woman was the one put in the position to make a decision.“I would always defer to hoping that her body came first and she was able to take action in this life of hers,” Sally said. “She was the person with a life. I think that trumps the idea of somebody else’s life that may or may not come to be in an environment of dysfunction. That could be really traumatizing and doesn’t take into consideration anyone’s wellbeing and mental health in the long term.”Sally’s experience with choice makes clear for her the importance of a woman’s ability to make her own decision about her own body. As a mother, she wants those choices to be available to her kids, too.Though, in recent months, the decision that Sally was able to make has been under fire by lawmakers across the U.S.After the Supreme Court declined to prevent abortion restrictions in states like Texas, some Wisconsin experts and citizens fear the right to choose may be taken off the table. With the legal road ahead unknown for individuals seeking abortions, people are stepping up to reflect upon and defend their stance on reproductive rights — and prepare for whatever comes next.The Texas Law: Part of a “totalitarian toolkit”Margarita Perez’s jaw dropped when the Texas Heartbeat Bill passed May 19.“It was like a kick in the stomach,” said Perez, a Latina gynecology medical assistant at the University of Wisconsin. “That’s how I felt as a female who grew up in Texas.”Perez worries for her family in Texas. She feels lucky she was able to leave Texas and educate herself about certain issues — an opportunity she believes many of her family members didn’t have.The Texas law, which bans abortions after six weeks — before some people know they are pregnant — went into place Sept. 1. The Supreme Court did not block the law despite backlash from abortion providers. The law includes no exceptions for rape or incest.The Supreme Court used the immediacy of the issue as a rationale to outright block it. Traditionally, the Court would decide the constitutionality of the law by waiting for the law to rise up through the appellate courts.Mike Murray, vice president of government affairs at Planned Parenthood Wisconsin, said pro-choice advocates’ confidence in legislators is waning following the ruling.“We’re moving into a new chapter of our history around the fight for reproductive rights and freedom, from a time when people who wanted to protect reproductive rights really relied on the court system to do that,” Murray said.Copycat Heartbeat Bills are now popping up around the U.S. in other Republican-dominated states such as North Dakota, Iowa, Arkansas and Mississippi. Heartbeat Bills are not a new phenomenon. The first one was introduced in Ohio in 2011, and seven more states since then have attempted to ban abortions at six weeks, according to the New York Times.Executive Director of the Texas Alliance of Life — a pro-life group in Texas — Joe Pojman said in a press release that every day since the law has been in effect has been a tremendous victory for unborn children who would otherwise have lost their lives to abortion.Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has also been vocal about his support of the Texas law. Patrick said protecting life was his top priority when he served in the Texas Senate.Patrick said Texas is a “solidly pro-life state, and the passage and enactment of this legislation reflects my continued commitment to protecting the most vulnerable.”Jenny Higgins, UW professor of obstetrics and gynecology and director of the UW Collaborative for Reproductive Equity, said the six-week ban is complicated for several reasons.“Many people cannot physiologically know they’re pregnant by six weeks, whether that’s because of underlying health conditions or irregular menstrual cycles, or other factors,” Higgins said. “Therefore, the six-week bans are discriminatory against classes of people who can’t recognize pregnancy by six weeks.”At six weeks, the embryo is one-fourth inch long and has limb buds and tissue that will develop into a spinal cord, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The six-week timeline, in effect, makes the law a near-total ban on abortions in Texas, pro-choice advocates argue.As someone who had an abortion, Sally feels that the law is dehumanizing.“The abortion laws are so hyper-focused on the one thing — ending life,” Sally said. “But so much is left out of what the experience is for the female.”The Texas law also deputizes citizens, allowing them to sue anyone who “aids or abets” in the performance or inducement of an abortion, according to the Associated Press. This deputization of citizens is one element of the law that caused backlash from doctors, because it uses a method of policing that was employed in Texas and other states during the Jim Crow era to enforce racist laws.UW social scientist Dietram Scheufele, who grew up in Germany, said the use of citizens’ arrests to him is reminiscent of past regimes in the U.S. and Europe that follow a “totalitarian toolkit.”“This country has seen the really troubling outgrowth of citizen’s arrests, with lynchings in the not-too-distant history,” Scheufele said. “I would argue that [citizens’ arrests are] just gross human rights violations at best. [Citizens’ arrests are] something that this country has in its DNA, but more often than not hasn’t worked out.”Already, lawsuits have been filed against Texas doctors who performed abortions.Since Texas implemented the abortion ban, the state has faced an internal battle over the law. A federal judge temporarily blocked the ban Oct. 6, but that was struck down by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Oct. 8. A federal appeals court then rejected the Biden administration’s latest attempt to stop the ban.Getting to the CORE of the issuePerez isn’t mentally strong every day, she said. She goes on long bike rides and cries, worried for her family in Texas. Many of her relatives are young Latine people who were already reluctant to seek out resources in fear of having immigration services called on them.“Coming from a low income, poor, urban background, I want to know what my people are going to do as Latinas,” Perez said.Like many laws in the U.S., the effects of abortion laws like the Heartbeat Bill are not felt equally throughout the country. People of color and those financially disadvantaged bear the brunt of the consequences of these laws.Even with the increasing number of closures of Planned Parenthood clinics and other healthcare facilities around the nation, Wisconsin still has many groups at UW and throughout Wisconsin that advocate for abortion rights and conduct research on reproductive health.Collaborative on Reproductive Equity, known as CORE, is an initiative at UW that supports and shares policy-relevant research on reproductive health, equity and autonomy in Wisconsin and beyond. CORE members conduct research on family planning, legislative processes, population changes, health inequities, access to contraception and more, according to an email statement from CORE Communications Manager Samantha Herndon.Researchers at CORE have documented that abortion restrictions contribute to maternal mortality, especially among Black women.The research shows people who are turned away from desired abortion services are more likely to stay in abusive relationships and experience persistent adverse economic consequences. They are also less likely to achieve aspirational life goals and complete postsecondary education compared to people who receive their desired abortion.Margy Balwierz , a 74-year-old Wisconsinite, wanted to bring her children into the best situation she could offer. She feels thankful that birth control and other reproductive health services were available to her throughout her life so she could provide her children with optimal care and opportunity.“I always wanted children but wanted to do it perfectly right for them,” Balwierz said. “I wanted them to have the right father and the right, healthy environment so they would thrive and become their own best selves. I can’t imagine bringing a child into the world without everything to their advantage.”For many, financial stability is one of the factors that influences whether parents decide to bring a child into the world. While financial instability may drive people to seek abortions, on the other hand, it is also an obstacle for those seeking abortions, as some cannot afford them.Lawmakers in states like Minnesota have made efforts to limit abortion access including attempts from legislators to ban taxpayer funding for abortion. In 2019, taxpayers reimbursed $1.01 million to abortion practitioners for 4,463 abortions.Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, a pro-life group in Minnesota, said abortion isn’t a service deserving of public funding, but rather an injustice against both unborn children and their mothers, and taxpayers should not be forced to pay for it.Minnesota State Sen. Gene Dornink said choosing life doesn’t need to be a partisan issue, and he is saddened that Minnesota Democrats have not chosen the bipartisan approach.“Everything we learned in class and know to be true says life begins at conception,” Sen. Dornink said in a news release. “Yet, bizarrely enough, we have almost unrestricted abortions in Minnesota, despite our laws protecting the unborn. This is a clear double standard.”Minnesota has seen closures of Planned Parenthood clinics in recent years, specifically during the Trump era, despite backlash from local politicians like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Gov. Tim Walz.Higgins said abortion clinic closures due to the restrictive environment have led to lower abortion rates. One of the biggest obstacles in the way of people seeking abortions is the cost, which includes the cost of transportation, childcare and missing work, she said.Researchers and other reproductive health professionals are guiding those who want to help abortion-seeking people to donate to local and national funds designed to provide financial assistance to those getting the procedure.The National Network of Abortion Funds provides information about local abortion funds and clinics. There are three abortion funds in Wisconsin — the Women’s Medical Fund, the Options Fund and the Freedom Fund.Higgins said restrictions on healthcare funding further limit those who are not able to expediently raise money to pay for the procedure.“In states like Texas and Wisconsin, there are funding restrictions on abortion, meaning that your healthcare might provide for pregnancy and birth-related costs, but not abortion termination costs, so people have to raise money out of pocket,” Higgins said. “For someone who doesn’t have $400 in their savings account, you can’t generate the funds you need for an abortion very quickly.”Planned Parenthood Wisconsin is another service that aims to provide assistance for those who need it. Murray said services provided by Planned Parenthood are still available to those who need them despite restrictions.“I think sometimes people read about all these restrictions going [on in] other states and the arguments that are going on nationally, and people get concerned about whether that type of care is still available in Wisconsin,” Murray said.Throwback to 1849A prominent and divisive topic in the conversation around abortion rights is Roe v. Wade, the most well-known and influential abortion rights case. Attempts to overturn the case have continued since the ruling in 1973. Jane Roe, a pseudonym for the plaintiff, filed a lawsuit in 1970 against the district attorney of Dallas County Henry Wade, responding to a restrictive Texas abortion law that outlawed abortion except to save a woman’s life. The case went to the Supreme Court and passed in a 7-2 majority. The powerful case found that the 14th amendment’s view of personal liberty included a person’s right to choose an abortion.Higgins said she expects Roe v. Wade to be overturned in the near future. In the case that the precedent is overturned, Higgins said abortion would become a state issue since each state would be affected differently if Roe is overturned, depending on protections in place.“A state like California has implemented protective abortion laws that will retain abortions legality regardless of Roe’s status, but places like Wisconsin will revert to laws that criminalize abortion,” Higgins said. “So, overturning Roe won’t immediately outlaw abortion in the whole country. It will only immediately outlaw abortion in those states like ours that have a pre-Roe law that outlaws it.”Wisconsin, for example, has no protective abortion laws. Murray said if Roe v. Wade is overturned, Wisconsin would revert to an 1849 law that criminalized abortion.Bea Lazarski/The Badger HeraldPerez, who is also a University Health Services employee, tries to stay positive about the state of affairs. She doesn’t see a threat to UHS yet and encourages students to continue to utilize the resources available to them. She is, however, nervous about unexpected laws that might pop up.“I don’t see any threat yet, and I’m hoping I don’t, but you know you can always get slapped in the face with the politics that go on,” Perez said. “So that’s always my main fear right now.”Groups around Wisconsin have unsuccessfully tried to overturn the 1849 Wisconsin law, which includes no exceptions of rape or incest, according to WPR. As someone with past experience with rape and abuse, Sally finds this extremely frustrating.Sally said the experience of getting the abortion was so emotionally taxing for her that she could not follow through with it the first time. Specifically, the pre-op questions were triggering because they asked about past sexual experiences she had never talked about before.“What got really complicated and overly emotional for me was the experience of talking about my sexuality and my sexual history with someone because I just hadn’t done that,” Sally said. “I hadn’t ever really processed or talked to anybody.”Regarding the absence of protection for victims of rape and assault, Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott said he would “eliminate all rapists from the streets” without offering suggestions on how to do so.A state dividedBalwierz, who began attending marches in 1965 and went to the 2017 Women’s March in D.C., said she has seen the same pattern of political manipulation surrounding abortion rights throughout her whole life. She feels especially disheartened by the current political state.“Women should be allowed to make the best choices for their womb by assessing their own needs and health,” Balwierz said. “Why would that be up to the government?”Wisconsin, a swing state that has flipped between the parties in recent years, is just as divided on the issue of abortion. After Republicans expanded control of the Wisconsin State Assembly and Scott Walker was elected governor in 2010, Planned Parenthood lost over one million dollars within the next year.Perez was working at Planned Parenthood when this funding was cut and had to move jobs due to the instability in payments. It was her favorite place she ever worked.“It was crazy because we were all kind of trying to figure out if we were even going to get paid and we were nervous because they sent out an email, not knowing if they were going to be able to make payroll,” Perez said.Walker proceeded to pass a large series of abortion laws that are still in place today, according to research by CORE.These laws include a mandatory 24-hour waiting period, a ban on abortion 20 weeks post-fertilization, prohibition of telemedicine for medication abortions, a ban on insurance coverage of abortion for state workers and the requirement that only physicians can provide abortion services.Now, GOP lawmakers in Wisconsin are attempting to pass more restrictive abortion legislation. For example, the Wisconsin legislature has already reintroduced their “Born Alive” abortion bill that was vetoed by Gov. Tony Evers in the last legislative session in April 2020.The bill would require health care workers to provide immediate care to ensure a newborn child is admitted to a hospital if the baby breathes, has a beating heart or shows the movement of voluntary muscles following an attempted abortion.Murray said copycat versions of the Texas Heartbeat Bill threaten the services offered by Planned Parenthood and other organizations that advocate for abortion rights.“The fact that the U.S. Supreme Court basically allowed a six-week abortion ban to go into effect in the state of Texas is definitely an invitation for other states who want to restrict access to abortion to do something similar,” Murray said.Adoption is commonly suggested as an alternative to abortion. In Wisconsin, Rep. Barbara Dittrich, R-Oconomowoc, Sen. Patrick Testin, R-Stevens Point, and Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, drafted a series of pro-life bills in support of adoption.Dittrich said she understands the “angst and fear of a woman seeking an abortion” but wants to encourage women to opt for adoption, rather than “making them think that killing their child is their only option.” The legislation Dittrich introduced includes protecting children from the effects of substance abuse and modifying timelines to move children into homes.However, Dittrich called the Wisconsin adoption system “over-burdensome.” Studies show that many children stay in the foster system for years, and a higher proportion of African American children are waiting to be adopted than are adopted in Wisconsin. Additionally, older children are not as likely to be adopted as younger children in Wisconsin.U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson is also in support of abortion pro-life bills and said he supports closures of abortion clinics like Planned Parenthood, calling it an “organization that enthusiastically trades in body parts of unborn children.”To add to the possible restrictions on abortion access, Wisconsin is redrawing its boundaries for congressional and legislative districts this year. The state currently has a Republican-controlled legislature, meaning the boundaries will likely be tailored to Republicans, according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. Though, the maps will have to be approved by Evers.Higgins said she believes the current redistricting in Wisconsin poses a threat to abortion access, specifically for underrepresented groups that have a difficult time accessing abortions — particularly people of color or low-income individuals.“This is a story about what voting redistricting and change in political landscape can mean for abortion access,” Higgins said. “In Wisconsin, the majority of voting citizens support abortion access, but the landscape of laws is disproportionate in terms of abortion restrictions versus access. That landscape will look much worse with further abortion restrictions and/or the overturning of Roe v. Wade.”In Wisconsin, 53% of people think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.Protection in electionOne of the ways Sally says she advocates for reproductive rights is by yielding the 19th amendment — her right to vote.Sally said she hopes to weaken the systems that support lawmakers who restrict reproductive rights or use the issue of abortion to benefit their political agenda.Schuefele said Republicans are being logical in their messaging around important issues like Roe v. Wade and regulating big tech companies to keep the battle alive in order to keep their message at the forefront of discussions.“I think part of the strategy [is] taking this to the Supreme Court, but I don’t think they were actually 100% certain that they would get the five-four decision that they got,” Schuefele said. “Instead, what they’re doing is they’re basically bringing up the issue, again and again, taking either little victories or little losses.”A key move for advocates of abortion restriction was the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett has been clear in the past about her devotion to the Catholic faith and is expected to vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. She did not block the Texas law when it went to the Supreme Court and was a part of the majority 5-4 decision.The Supreme Court was designed to be apolitical, making decisions based on constitutionality, not according to political party lines or religion. The debate around whether this purpose holds true today, however, is ongoing.Abortion is a largely debated issue in the religious community, as Catholic and Evangelical Protestant churches are especially vocal about their opposition to abortion. A statement from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops states that there is an affirmed “moral evil” in abortion, and to them, this remains unchangeable.President Biden, a Catholic, has faced backlash from religious authorities since before the beginning of his term because of his stance on abortion. In President Biden’s campaign platform, he said his Justice Department will do “everything in its power to stop the rash of state laws that so blatantly violate Roe v. Wade.”After Biden won the White House, ten of the most powerful bishops in the U.S. decided to launch a “working group” on how to approach a Catholic president like Joe Biden. They are currently drafting guidelines for who should receive the Eucharist, claiming Biden does not adhere to the official beliefs of the religion.According to UW political science professor Howard Schweber, there is a potential issue of church-state separation as American bishops declare that Biden or any other supporter of abortion rights should be denied communion.“To a believing Catholic, the threat of being denied communion is a severe one, so we have a situation in which religious authorities are using their position to try to coerce an elected representative into supporting a particular policy against his principles,” Schweber said. “That strikes me as problematic.”Some religious figures in Wisconsin, such as Bishop Donald Hying of Madison, have criticized Biden’s stance on abortion as well.“People always claimed that President Biden was personally opposed to abortion. Today, he said, ‘I respect those who believe life begins at the moment of conception and all, I respect that — don’t agree — but I respect that.’ Today, we’ve all learned the painful and disturbing truth,” Hying said in a tweet.Former President Trump’s presidency was “strongly pro-life,” which reflected the views of his large constituent base of Evangelical Christians.Murray feels advocacy work is most important for people to get involved in and said relying on the federal government for protection won’t work anymore.“It’s really important that people who care about these rights and freedoms are getting involved in work, to make sure that people who are running for office really share [and] reflect those values,” Murray said. “The access to those types of care will be won and lost in state legislatures in state elections for the foreseeable future.”Taking Action Despite a plethora of social, political and economic changes since 1947, Balwierz said she draws striking parallels between her childhood and now. She has been fighting for women’s rights her entire life.“Things seem to be going backward,” Balwierz said. “Two steps forward, three steps back.”Despite the complicated reality of abortion rights, activists, public figures and common citizens around the U.S. and other countries — even strong Catholic ones — are mobilizing in support of abortion. Mexico, Argentina, Guyana and Cuba are all giving more access to abortion and decriminalizing the procedure.Thousands of people around the U.S. participated in women’s marches in early October as well. In Texas, abortion “hacktivists” flooded an abortion website, prolifewhistleblower.com, with fake tips, according to the New York Times. The tips claim Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was a violator of the newly passed law, either seeking, aiding or abetting in abortions.Locally, there are many efforts at UW and around Wisconsin to advocate for abortion protections. CORE published a brief about the Texas law and how it could impact Wisconsin. The brief explained state abortion bans have more impact than federal bans and certain communities are more likely to be affected by this kind of ban.Other Wisconsin state and federal legislators have spoken out on Twitter. Sen. Tammy Baldwin said, “Everyone deserves to make their own decisions about their health & future.”For people like Sally, the benefits of the right to choose are standing right in front of them.Sally’s children smile back at her, grateful to have a mother who wanted them and who could provide them with the care she knew she couldn’t offer them in 1976.Sally is grateful both she and her mother were able to make the choices for their own bodies, and she is reminded that each story is an example of a personal choice made by an individual.“It’s not just about pro-life or pro-choice for me, it’s about a lot of things,” Sally said. “It’s reproductive rights, it’s choice.”","Two steps forward, three steps back: Some fear for the future of the right to choose",UWM

https://badgerherald.com/features/2021/11/03/dying-to-divest-uw-students-fight-for-climate-justice-on-campus/,"Nov 3, 2021","Climate change caused 262 deaths in the past year in the U.S. alone.A recent United Nations report reflects an even grimmer future — before a child born today turns 30, the impacts of climate change — such as species extinction, widespread disease, unlivable heat, ecosystem collapse and rising seas — will be staggeringly obvious. Scientists warn the number of people facing chronic hunger, extreme poverty and death will only grow as the climate warms.As the planet’s temperature rises, students’ tolerance for stagnant climate policies declines. In the face of what some scientists call a climate emergency, University of Wisconsin student groups are taking action to combat climate change, demanding UW’s complete divestment from fossil fuels.Digging into DivestmentThe UW Foundation and Alumni Association, known as WFAA, is one of the UW System’s independent, private 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations. It’s governed by a board comprising UW alumni and donors.The WFAA’s most recent asset class information is in its 2019-2020 Financial Report, but its last public estimate of its investments in fossil fuels is from 2017-2018. The report estimates WFAA’s investments in oil and gas accounted for over $124 million of its approximately $3.8 billion in total investments as of June 2018. But WFAA CEO and President Michael Knetter said fossil fuel assets have been a diminishing percentage of overall portfolio investments.BEATRICE LAZARSKI/The Badger HeraldThe 2018 estimate is based on oil and gas companies’ net asset values, or NAV, which is a company’s assets minus its debts. Because private equity, hedge funds, timber, real estate, oil and gas don’t have quoted market prices, they’re carried at NAV per share or its equivalent. Oil and gas investments are paired together in the report under alternative investments, but quoted market prices are not available.This means the most recent price that buyers and sellers of oil and gas agreed upon is not available to the public. The data presented regarding fossil fuel investments is an estimate of what the foundation invested in those years. While specific information about tangible figures is not available, the estimates confirm the foundation is actively invested in oil and gas.Several groups have questioned the foundation’s investment in fossil fuels as the means to procure funds to donate to UW. For example, the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts — a statewide collaboration of scientists and stakeholders that UW created in partnership with the Department of Natural Resources — released a report calling on all UW System Foundations to sell their stocks and investments in the top 200 fossil fuel companies and ban any future fossil fuel investments.The organization submitted the directive a year after Gov. Tony Evers asked the group to guide his Task Force on Climate Change, which resulted in a report detailing the extent to which Wisconsinites already experience climate change’s consequences.On the grassroots level, the Wisconsin Student Climate Action Coalition is one of the many student-led groups pioneering the cause for responsible environmental efforts on campus. Also known as WSCAC, the coalition organizes with representatives from environmental and social justice groups to build a movement of UW students advocating for climate action, environmental justice and sustainability.WSCAC Co-chair Stephanie Janeth Salgado Altamirano said the coalition works as a medium to allow direct action organization across UW’s many climate justice organizations. Altamirano stressed the importance of building a coalition outside of the university to advocate for change on campus.“There’s a lot of guidelines student [organizations] have to follow if you’re going to receive funding from the university that would stop a lot of our direct actions,” she said.One group WSCAC works with is UW Divestment Coalition, a student-led organization representing all 13 UW campuses. UW Divestment’s team coordinator Molly McGuire said the coalition has three main goals.“The first is to have all UW System Foundations provide transparency about what they invest in, the second is to have them divest from any fossil fuel-related companies and our third is to have them reinvest in companies that will actually benefit the state of Wisconsin and promote a clean, equitable future,” McGuire said.Two steps forward, three steps back: Some fear for the future of the right to choose
CONTENT WARNING: Discussion of rape and sexual assault. If you have been sexually assaulted, or are not sure, there are Read…McGuire said about 5% of a typical portfolio contains fossil fuel investments. Between all the foundations, UW Divestment estimated there are $7 billion of investments. The coalition evaluates the UW System Foundations invest $315 million every year in fossil fuels.It’s McGuire’s belief the Board of Regents should create legislation to send a clear message to the foundation — if WFAA does not stop investing in fossil fuels, the UW System will not accept its money and end their relationship. McGuire said she believes the UW System is culpable to a degree because they have the power to influence the foundation given their strong relationship, but do not.The Associated Students of Madison, the Climate Defense Project and student governments from UW-Stevens Point, UW-Eau Claire, UW-La Crosse, UW-Oshkosh, UW-Parkside, UW-Stout and UW-River Falls have all called on the WFAA to remove its investments in fossil fuels. In 2020, all Big Ten student body presidents unanimously passed a resolution demanding their universities freeze fossil fuel investments.Student initiatives like WSCAC and UW Divestment serve as direct action groups, continuing to challenge the status quo of current sustainability efforts on campus. But students are not alone in their calls for divestment from the ground level on campus.Faculty Senate SupportUW’s faculty is governed by the Faculty Senate which can vote to change rules and pass resolutions outlining the faculty’s stance on divestment. Former Faculty Senate member Steph Tai, who currently works as a UW professor of law and as legal representation for prominent climate scientists and numerous professional aquatic science societies, co-drafted one such resolution for divestment and sustainable procurement.“This is different from other divestment resolutions happening around the country,” Tai said. “[The resolution] calls not only for carbon-friendly investments that divest from fossil fuels, but also carbon-friendly procurement in terms of what we buy for the university — including things like food, paper and furniture.”Tai said the secretary of the faculty is forming a working group to assist with the more practical efforts of moving forward with divestment, likely studying the acquisition processes and how to negotiate with the WFAA.The working group is studying environmentally friendly procurement, Tai said. The resolution they co-drafted will give the group more force within the university to initiate change.Though this is a good first step, the process is taking longer than Tai would like.“There still needs to be work done by the University of Wisconsin Alumni Foundation. They unfortunately have been reluctant to proceed on this front,” Tai said. “Not only is this important for the future of the planet but also important in terms of not having risky investments, there’s more and more fossil fuel companies getting sued or hit with fines, so it’s actually not a very good investment from a non-environmental standpoint.”While there’s near-unanimous faculty support for the resolution, this consensus is nothing new — a divestment resolution was first proposed in the 2010s but didn’t include the new details on the process of business spending.Though UW Chancellor Rebecca Blank hasn’t vocalized a stance regarding divestment and more environmentally sound procurement, Tai said her support would serve the cause. Given the UW foundation’s status as alumni-run and owned, however, Tai stated the most powerful catalyst for the foundation to change would be if alumni spoke up.“The risk of investing in fossil fuels is getting higher, and I think that’s what is going to change their position, not necessarily responding to climate change,” Tai said.Tai added the working group will document risks for the foundation in a persuasive way.Doubts About DivestmentThe Office of Sustainability currently uses the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System, or STARS, to track UW’s sustainability progress. Though UW ranks the lowest out of Big Ten universities, some of those schools’ reports — like the University of Minnesota — are expired. UW’s most recent sustainable procurement score is two out of three.Assistant director of the Office of Sustainability Nathan Jandl explained that in the most basic sense, procurement is how UW obtains its goods. The procurement score evaluates the pathways through which UW sources its supplies such as food, furniture and paper as well as what kind of carbon footprint these goods have, which includes their lifecycles. Jandl said the Office of Sustainability is currently working with procurement professionals on campus about how to improve these factors.UW’s sustainability efforts within the context of the products and services it procures are better than its efforts regarding sustainable investments, Jandl said. UW’s sustainable investment score is zero out of four since UW did not self-report data. The only response UW gave was “no” to a question that asked if the institution wished to pursue positive sustainability investment.“I don’t think it’s uncommon for institutions not to self-report on their investment strategies,” Jandl said. “The body that’s doing the investing in this case is the UW Foundation which is a private entity that is affiliated with UW but not a part of it. There’s not a direct responsibility for them to report their investments to the university.”WFAA CEO and President Michael Knetter said the foundation hires outside managers to invest funds on its behalf and it takes environmental, social and governance — also called ESG — factors into consideration when it selects them.Knetter said when looking through to the holdings of outside managers, the foundation’s share of investments in fossil fuel-related entities is very small. Knetter also stated the foundation’s fossil fuel assets have been a diminishing percentage of their overall investments.United in action: UW students rally to reimagine public safety on Wisconsin campuses
UW-Eau Claire student activists were shocked when members of their football team, who mocked a Black Male Empowerment group by Read…The WFAA board of directors discussed the possibility of introducing a new investment option in which donors could choose to place their money in a strategy with a heavier emphasis on ESG factors but chose not to pursue it because of the potential expenses.Jandl said the Office of Sustainability doesn’t have a specific stance regarding the WFAA’s investments but is supportive of looking into financial leverage for achieving climate action.In Jandl’s view, divestment is more of a symbolic gesture than it is a practical one for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.“The more I’ve learned about divestment, the more I understand it’s an important thing from the perspective of sending a message and sometimes an important thing from the perspective of emissions reductions, but mostly the former as opposed to the latter,” Jandl said.Knetter explained the foundation has a fiduciary responsibility to its board of over 40 alumni donors to pursue the best return on investment as prudent stewards of their gift. Eliminating any category of investment could be a legal and ethical violation of their fiduciary duties.Though Knetter said the foundation listens to student and staff calls for divestment, considers these perspectives and has ongoing discussions about the issue with its Board of Directors.A declaration of divestment would be welcomed by some donors, but for many it would feel like their money is being used as a political statement, Knetter said. On the other hand, student activists have argued not divesting from fossil fuels is a political statement as well.But UW hasn’t shied away from politicization in the past — UW was one of the first universities to recognize the apartheid in South Africa and at the forefront of divesting by selling all its holdings in companies doing business in the country a decade before most other divestment campaigns. Now, a South African non-profit is asking UW to stop investing in fossil fuels completely.“Donors do not, and should not dictate institutional investment policy, especially given that the University of Wisconsin is a public institution — their main goal is to support the mission of the university or college,” Fossil Free South Africa said on its website. “Since fossil-free investment fits the institution’s mission, it should pose no problem for them.”Details of DivestmentSimilarly to the point Jandl made about the tangible impact of divestment to actually reduce emissions, recent research from Ivy League experts shows divestment from companies that do not meet the ESG criteria may not be as practical as some believe. In order to have a real impact, major investors would need to divest in overwhelmingly large numbers.But investment giants are beginning to do just that. Last month, ABP — one of the world’s largest pension funds with assets worth over $400 billion — said it will purge its entire holding of $17.5 billion in the fossil fuel industry and invest instead in clean energy in the car and aviation industry. Ford Foundation, one of the largest U.S. private foundations which was built on the back of the fossil fuel industry, also announced its plans to divest and invest in renewable energy. Coutts, Queen Elizabeth II and the British royal family’s wealth manager, has also promised to divest.Even BlackRock, the biggest asset manager on earth, which has historically refused to take action on climate change, asked its analysts to assess portfolios of those who have divested. They found investors who disinvested from fossil fuels saw both moral and financial gain — reporting no negative performance as a result of divestment but instead “outperformed their benchmarks” and found neutral to positive results.The Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau found there is no clear process through which the state can require the UW System Foundation to divest from fossil fuels because the foundation is a private 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, but the Governor’s Task Force on Climate Change Report explicitly states the UW System Foundations should discontinue investments in the top 200 fossil fuel companies.Though the path seems unclear, several other high-profile universities have taken steps toward divestment in recent years. The world’s leading higher education institutions, such as Harvard, Dartmouth, Cambridge, Oxford, Columbia, Brown and Cornell University have entirely divested from fossil fuels. Even Big Ten universities, including Minnesota, Michigan-Ann Arbor, Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Rutgers announced their plans to divest — adding to the growing number of almost 1,500 institutions worldwide that have divested $39.88 trillion total.Regardless of UW, more young students who feel the threats of climate change will come into UW every year, meaning student vigor and power are only set to grow, student leaders contend.Leaders like McGuire and Altamirano will continue to stand up and fight for divestment and a sustainable future — whether alumni investing in fossil fuels change their minds or not.“UW policies are not sustainable and do not live up to the morals and values that we now, as a society and as young people, value considering this climate crisis,” Altamirano said.",Dying to divest: UW students fight for climate justice on campus,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2017/11/14/sexual-assault-victims-deserve-an-effective-justice-system/,"Nov 14, 2017","When allegations of sexual misconduct against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein broke Oct. 5, so did a movement of public accusations against other high-profile men.Over the past month, more than 20 other men in high powered positions have been accused of sexual misconduct, including head of news at NPR Michael Oreskes, editorial director of Vox Media Lockhart Steele, E! News correspondent Ken Baker and comedian Louis C.K. Many of these men have been accused by multiple people.The influx of reports has empowered many people to share their stories with the media, write articles, report to new outlets and share on their own personal social media accounts. This kind of publicity is powerful — it highlights the extent of the issue and holds perpetrators accountable for their actions.But why have these reports all been to media outlets, as opposed to the police?According to the Rape, Assault, and Incest National Network out of every 1000 rapes, 994 perpetrators will walk free.Contrast this to assault and battery crimes, where more than twice as many crimes are reported, and nearly six times as many perpetrators will be incarcerated.It’s no wonder survivors are now sharing their stories with the media — it is so difficult to find legal justice that they must resort to justice in the public eye. Amber Amour, who documented the aftermath of her assault on her own social media, said, “Me telling my story was my own form of justice.”Our justice system is failing survivors and protecting their attackers, and here’s how.Dr. Kimberly Lonsway, an expert on sexual assault, and Sergeant Joanne Archambault of the San Diego Police Department, published an article highlighting the reasons why perpetrators of sexual violence rarely face legal prosecution. They argue that there is a misconception about a stereotypical “real rape” and assaults that look different than that image are much less likely to be prosecuted.This stereotype looks like this: The assault is a violent attack committed by a stranger against a young, attractive, sober, white woman, who immediately reports the assault and recalls the assault with 100 percent accuracy. This stereotype is perpetuated by the media and our inability to re-examine our assumptions about survivors of sexual violence. The impact of this stereotype is that in cases where the attack does not match this story — which is most cases — the survivor is less likely to be believed, the police are less likely to properly investigate the crime and prosecutors are less likely to pursue a conviction.If you’re shocked by #MeToo, you’re actively contributing to the problem
In March of 2014, Christine Fox set out to disprove an ignorant comment made by a man on her timeline, Read…One example of this is in the way that police investigations are conducted, and type of evidence that investigators look for. Because of this misconception of how rape is “supposed” to look, investigations often focus on what is called “identification evidence,” i.e., which will help identify the assailant (fingerprints, biological evidence, footprints, etc.).But, more than 70 percent of assaults are committed by someone known to the survivor. In these situations identification evidence is often not effective because the defendant will frequently use a “consent defense.” In other words, they will claim that the sexual act took place, but was consensual.In these cases, it is necessary to obtain alternate forms of evidence that demonstrate, force, threat, fear or other evidence of lack of consent. These can include evidence of victim intoxication, interviews with the first person to whom the survivor disclosed their account of the incident or evidence from the crime scene to support a struggle. When this evidence is not collected or utilized the case is unlikely to end in a conviction because it will end up being a “he said, she said” situation.In 2012, Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston was accused of sexual assault, but due to the publicity and popularity of the assailant, the state did not want to pursue an investigation, and consequently mishandled the investigation and the evidence so the case would not move forward.In New York, laws about sexual harassment in the workplace refer to the intention of the offender: “A person is guilty of forcible touching when such person intentionally, and for no legitimate purpose forcibly touches the sexual or other intimate parts of another person…” Because of this provision, one reason that Harvey Weinstein was not prosecuted in New York was because his lawyer was able to argue the reason he touched a model’s breasts was because he was trying to determine if she had breast implants.Many of our laws even retain vestiges of a culture when rape was a crime against property. In 2013, Ezekiel Gilbert paid an escort $150 in exchange for sex. When she refused sex, Gilbert shot her in the neck — immediately paralyzing her. Seven months later, she died. Gilbert was acquitted in court after his lawyer argued that the use of deadly force was legal due to a provision in Texas law that allows the use of deadly force to “retrieve stolen property at night.”It’s on us to change the way we talk about sexual assault
It’s your typical trip home from the library on an October night, it’s nearly 1:30 a.m. when you throw on Read…Our justice system needs to do a better job of protecting survivors and prosecuting assailants. The Bureau of Justice estimates that at least 60 percent of of assaults go unreported. According to the National Violence Against Women Survey, of those who chose to not report, 25 percent said they made that decision because they either felt the police would not be able to help, would not believe them or blame them.When survivors feel the only way they can get justice for themselves is to post their stories on Twitter, it should be clear that we have a problem in our justice system. We need to dispel our criminal justice system of laws that allow defendants to refer to women as property. We need to establish a culture in which we recognize that there is not a “recipe for rape” and that sexual violence looks different in different cases. We need to encourage law enforcement to recognize the same, and conduct full and complete investigation appropriate to the type of crime. Most of all, we need to shift our focus from protecting offenders to supporting survivors.Cait Gibbons (cgibbons3@wisc.edu) is a sophomore studying mathematics.",Sexual assault survivors deserve an effective justice system,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2019/10/22/intersectionality-in-sexual-assault-how-race-gender-identity-and-other-factors-impact-sexual-crimes/,"Oct 22, 2019","While it is common knowledge that sexual assault is a significant issue on almost every college campus in the nation, many would be surprised by the rate at which it continues to increase. According to RAINN, 11.2% of graduate and undergraduate students in America “experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence, or incapacitation.”This unfortunate statistic includes the University of Wisconsin. According to the most recent campus climate survey, 26.1% of female undergraduates have experienced sexual assault since starting college. This is comparable to the national average, where one in four undergraduate female students reported being sexually assaulted. It is clear that college poses additional risks in terms of creating safety measures against sexual violence.The prevalence of sexual assault is not limited to female undergraduates — this continues to disproportionately affect minorities, students with disabilities and LGBTQ+ students. The 2019 preliminary findings by UW found women and TGQN students reported the highest rates of sexual assault — though the rate for the latter did decrease since 2015, from 29% to 28.4%.While this increase in sexual assault reports among female undergraduates does not necessarily translate to increasing rates of the crime occurring, the fact that a quarter of female undergraduates have been or will be sexually violated is horrifying. Similarly, a decrease in reports from transgender, genderqueer or gender-nonconforming students does not mean reduced crime rates. More likely, there are several social factors disincentivizing minority victims of sexual assault from reporting their crimes.LGBTQ+ students experience higher levels of poverty, social marginalization and overall reported increased accounts of alienation. All these factors contribute to increased vulnerability to sexual assaults. Moreover, it may account for underreporting of sexual assault from LGBTQ+ students.Steering clear of the cliff: UW strives to educate students on ‘clear and obvious’ consent despite limited legal language
A quick stroll through the Student Activity Center will reveal they’ve done some redecorating. Whereas the construction of the new Read…Since 2016, hate crimes have been reported to have decreased five-fold at UW. But this does not take into account cases of sexual assault which victimize minorities as a form of a hate-motivated crime. The excessive rates of sexual assault against the LGBTQ+ community and nontraditional students on campus beg a more in-depth look into the nature of these crimes — the unique experiences that make them vulnerable to being victims of sexual assault.Sexual assault training for professions can be considered superficial in nature and may not address the differences between LGBTQ+ relationships as opposed to heterosexual relationships. Often times, violence — sexual or otherwise — within an LGBTQ+ relationship does not conform to what is traditionally understood as violent behavior.Even if the case seems black-and-white and its violent nature incontestable, these social factors may lead some to stay silent. As it goes unreported, the victim may continue to be in an abusive environment, further driving them to remain silent about their continual assault.Unfortunately, this story of institutions perpetuating victim-shaming does not end with the LGBTQ+ community. According to End Rape on Campus, “While 80% of rapes are reported by white women, women of color are more likely to be assaulted than white women.”This gross underreporting of sexual crimes is the outcome of centuries-long perpetuated rape myths, including victim-blaming and the general hostility experienced by African-American women within the legal system.ASM hears from chancellor about diversity, sexual assault
The Associated Students of Madison heard from Chancellor Rebecca Blank and voted to move forward with adding mental health hotline Read…Women in poverty can similarly relate, as their cases are often not even taken into consideration for the select few that do report their crimes.Poverty includes an additional aspect to the barriers of sexual assault — the expenses associated with being sexually abused are often not taken into consideration. Evidence collection, loss of jobs and mental health issues are all common and incredibly expensive consequences of sexual assault. Students themselves can experience further education-related financial burdens as their GPAs decline. They might lose their scholarships, which negatively affects their later employability. Considering the damages accumulated over a survivor’s lifetime, rape can cost between $151,423 – $265,400.Following the AAU survey, Chancellor Rebecca Blank released a statement expressing her goals for addressing the issue.“Reducing sexual violence at UW will require changes in behavior and culture as well as in resources and the campus environment,” Blank said.This sentiment accurately reflects the necessary social change needed for increasing minority representation among survivors who report their sexual assault.UW Homecoming video emblematic of deep-seeded racial issues at UW
The University of Wisconsin Homecoming Committee posted a video Sept. 30 intended to generate excitement about the upcoming homecoming events. Instead, Read…It is crucially important that sexual assault professionals understand that sexual assault cases do not merely include a victim and a perpetrator. They include a highly complex, well-established system of shifting paradigms of what it means to be sexually assaulted. It requires them to take into consideration communities or individuals that perpetuate victim silencing and how these people affect the victim themselves.It is no surprise that sexual assault has devastating consequences, both financially and academically. However, it can be especially devastating for survivors of assault who live in environments that actively discourage reporting it.Creating mandatory programs for undergraduate students which informs students about sexual assault and alcohol safety are excellent programs that have increased student understanding of sexual violence. Even so, the disproportionate rate of minority students sexually assaulted calls for a massive overhaul on a societal level and suggests additional training for professionals to understand the unique nature of minority victims and the barriers preventing them from getting help.Discussions of race, socioeconomic status and sexual orientation and how they relate to the prevalence of sexual assault are paramount to reducing sexual assault rates among minority individuals and encouraging minorities to speak up and seek help.Samiha Bhushan (bhushan3@wisc.edu) is a freshman studying neurobiology and English literature.","Intersectionality in sexual assault: How race, gender identity and other factors impact sexual crimes",UWM

A suspect has been arrested after a reported sexual assault early Sunday morning on Langdon Street. According to the Madison Read…And, despite high-profile incidents on campus, despite the rising rate of sexual assaults on college campuses across America, despite the #MeToo movement, despite the convictions of celebrities and politicians, UW has fallen into a familiar rhythm.The Blue Light Initiative — also known as Blue Buttons — is a series of petitions and demands by student government to improve student safety after recent assaults on Langdon Street. Blue-lit stations, staggered every thirty seconds, could direct police to a crime as soon as a button was pressed.It sounded good in theory. On paper, it was a framework for implementing effective security measures across campus. A way to catch up with dozens of other large, urban universities across the country. To respond quickly to burglaries and robberies as soon as they happened.But when Associated Students of Madison’s Equity and Inclusion Committee took up the petition in the context of preventing sexual assaults, my head exploded.Following seven percent voter turnout, ASM welcomes new members
In an election that saw a voter turnout of just seven percent of the University of Wisconsin student body, the Read…Overnight, the Blue Light Petition was adopted by a significant number of candidates running for election, becoming a cause célèbre for those who blanked on what else to put in their bio. Several candidates, predominantly male, doubled down on the idea that UW was somehow failing sexual assault victims by not installing blue lights — and that it would be their priority, so students — especially female ones — could be safer.There are a thousand things wrong with that assertion. To start with the easy one, the idea that sexual assault would somehow magically disappear with the installation of blue lights seems cruel. But digging beneath the haphazard layer of please vote for me because, unlike everyone else, I agree that sexual assault is bad, there are an infinite number of implications — that victims of sexual assault are attacked because they are outside at night, that these assaults are by strangers — that there is, ultimately, no preventative measure — only recourse.Our fault for being outside at night alone. The idea of shouldering that blame now is ridiculous to me. But at a time of increased public awareness of violent crime in downtown Madison, I realized that much of the world hadn’t moved along with me.What the statements of ASM and its members miss, disappointingly, are the facts. According to a snapshot released last year by UW, sexual assaults reported to the university rarely, if ever, occurred on public property. Sexual assaults were more likely to involve assailants already known to the victim than not. For incidents reported on campus, almost 54 percent occurred within residence halls. Other happened in non-campus locations, such as fraternity houses and student apartments.After proposed Title IX changes, UW System affirms commitment to upholding practices preventing misconduct

The abdication of responsibility by students, ASM and allies to hold ourselves accountable for a culture of violence is not only insulting — it is extremely dangerous.

For a group that has championed the expansion of mental health resources at University Health Services, ASM has deftly ignored one of the reasons many students seek out care in the first place — sexual assault and trauma. And why address the symptom, when you never acknowledge the cause?Blue lights, despite their undeniable benefits, are not a solution. There will be no solution until we accept that the root causes of sexual assault and violence on campus lie within our own hands and mouths. There will be no solution until we elect more student representatives of color, of backgrounds, of different ethnicities and genders, who can provide a contrasting perspective to what seems like a unanimous step in a dangerously meaningless direction.Women should not have to defend decisions they make about their own bodies

The Wisconsin State Journal reported the investigation closed in March of last year after finding Waller had engaged in sexual harassment. Waller retired in June. UW spokesperson Meredith McGlone said in an email to the Badger Herald that the university was unable to release investigative reports because the information in them would reveal the identity of the accuser. “In a number of cases, the university has been able to release redacted investigative reports without jeopardizing the privacy of survivors,” McGlone said. “However, in this particular case, that simply was not possible.Furthermore, UW Campus Title IX Coordinator Lauren Hasselbacher said the university understands the community’s concerns about sexual violence and misconduct and that UW does everything it can to respond appropriately.In a sexual harassment investigation there are several reports and documents the public should have access to, though, Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council Chair Bill Lueders said. He said there should be documentation of the original allegation, reports from the investigation, records of interviews conducted and a final resolution on the findings of the investigation. “None of those documents were released in the case involving professor Waller,” Lueders said. “We don’t know what misconduct occurred.

These investigations were all opened by the OCR in 2015.Lueders said he finds the lack of information provided by UW concerning in both cases. “My perspective is that UW-Madison is over-applying student privacy rules,” Lueders said. “In these instances, it should not be impossible for the public to know what conduct was alleged and what misconduct was affirmed [by an investigation].”AAU report finds sexual assault rates of females remain unchanged since 2015

Hasselbacher said information about this process is available on the Title IX website. UHS Survivor Services Coordinator Zoë Whaley wrote in an email to the Badger Herald why it is important to protect survivors’ anonymity during and after an investigation.“The confidential support we provide survivors is essential to the healing process,” Whaley said. “Our staff supports survivors in deciding what is most helpful for them, and maintaining their privacy often determines whether or not a survivor will seek resources. Survivors manage many challenges and their privacy — both in records and more— helps maintain their safety.”Hasselbacher said revealing accusers identities could discourage survivors from coming forward and filing a complaint.Former UW summer program participant sues university, alleging sexual harassment, assault

Protecting sexual assault survivors during the reporting process is essential, she said, because they are the ones who have been harmed.“You want to establish support around them, so I can understand from that perspective why reports remain redacted,” Abu-Hakmeh said.  “But on the same end of that, it becomes an issue because students are unaware of the levels of assault that occur on campus.”Abu-Hakmeh said UW has made improvements in recent years to better support survivors. The university is constantly hiring new counselors, and last semester UHS piloted extended hours for students to access mental health help, she said.But a stronger push for change will need to occur for the university to make a bigger impact on helping with survivor recovery, Abu-Hakmeh said. “We are committed to continuing to improve — the university is using data from the recent AAU sexual assault and misconduct survey as well as ongoing campus feedback to further enhance our education, prevention and response efforts,” Hasselbacher said.",UW cannot release sexual harassment report in botany case,UWM

https://badgerherald.com/features/2021/11/16/people-of-uw-wisconsin-collegiate-deca-president-shares-how-deca-prepared-her-for-success/,"Nov 16, 2021","Editor’s note: People of Madison is a weekly series produced by Digital Features Associates. The series — published online and on our social media accounts — aims to highlight a student at UW making an impact on the campus community. These Q&As are lightly edited for clarity and style.JENNY PATINOWhy did you decide to major in the studies that you chose?Originally, I wanted to go into some sort of consulting role. In high school, I was involved in DECA, so I had gotten exposed to a lot of business areas and found that I really was drawn to the business world in general. I ended up choosing marketing because you can do so much with a degree in marketing. As I continued through my studies over the last four years, I realized I really enjoyed working with other people. That’s how I decided upon the additional major of management. I ended up picking up human resources because I wanted to broaden my horizons, learn about different fields of business and see how I could apply them in the future.How do you wish to impact the world with your studies?I took a job offer with Kohl’s, so I’m currently pursuing the retail management path. I’ve been impacted by managers in my time at Kohl’s as a part-time associate. They’re able to lead so effectively and have been able to create such a connection with me from the time I was 17 — now I’m 21. Being able to create connections with the people I would lead can really drive a much more impactful experience. I think being exposed to all different areas of business has helped me be open minded, which is really important today. You have such a diverse workforce that you’re able to make connections. I feel my majors and experience with retail has really opened me up to wanting to create more connections with people and drive experiences in that way.Could you talk about DECA and how you first got involved?DECA is a professional development organization geared towards developing students for their future career endeavors. At the UW chapter specifically, we focus on three main components — competition, community service and professional development. The case study competitions are on-the-spot business scenarios. You have to create a solution in 30 or 60 minutes and present that solution to a judge. In order to score well, there are specific metrics you need to hit to move to the next competition. We also focus on community service. In the past, we have volunteered at Second Harvest Food Bank and River Food Pantry. In terms of professional development, we bring in a lot of speakers from different areas of business. For example, we had someone from First Business Financial American Family share about their experiences in the world once they graduated college.I got involved in DECA seven years ago when I was a sophomore in high school. It’s crazy that it’s been that long. One of my friends who enjoyed it for the social aspects recommended it to me. I ended up finding that I was really drawn to all the aspects of the business case study competitions. I found myself interested in being more involved in DECA at the collegiate level because it is more student-run than in high school. In high school, you have an advisor planning all the conferences and events, but in college, you get the experience of planning a conference or creating a budget. I was the vice president my sophomore year and the president of the UW chapter last year. Last spring, I ran for state office and was elected the first state president from UW, which is a cool feature because we’ve never had someone from UW involved in a role within our state organization.People of UW: PAVE volunteer coordinator explains need to promote safeguarding against sexual assault
Editor’s note: People of Madison is a weekly series produced by Digital Features Associate Dylan Wijas. The series — published online Read…Why do you think that organizations like DECA are essential on college campuses?I think it’s important that as we go through our undergraduate studies we become professionally well-rounded. Yes, we get to learn a lot in the classroom about marketing subjects, finance and cash flow statements, but I really feel like the real-life application I’ve gotten from DECA has set me apart from others in terms of the interview process and being prepared to have a role for myself before graduating college. These student organizations do a really good job of preparing people to be professionals because you don’t necessarily get that in the classroom. All these extracurriculars make so much of a difference once you get out in the workforce.In what ways has the progression of your growth in leadership altered your perception of business?Leadership has taught me better time management. Obviously, once you start taking on more leadership roles, you have to really know how to balance your time. People management skills are super important, especially if you plan on going into a manager role one day. I think that is such an important skill that everyone should have because you’re always going to be working with people. The business world is super collaborative nowadays. Even in the business school, I feel like most of my classes always have some sort of group project component.What is your favorite part about being a member and a leader of DECA?I always tell people my favorite part is the award ceremony at competition and seeing everyone’s hard work pay off, whether it be qualifying for nationals or coming home with a trophy. I love seeing other people succeed. Our whole chapter gets really hyped up at awards cheering for each other.",People of UW: Wisconsin Collegiate DECA president shares how DECA prepared her for success,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/10/18/doj-launches-website-tracking-backlog-of-untested-sexual-assault-kits/,"Oct 18, 2017","The Wisconsin Department of Justice announced a new website last month to keep the public informed on the number of untested sexual assault kits, otherwise known as “rape kits.”Currently there are 6,391 previously untested kits, 4,067 kits of which are designated for testing.In 2015, the state DOJ received two $2 million grants from the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the New York County District Attorney’s Office to address the accumulation of untested kits in possession of state agencies and hospitals. It’s been just over two years since the program was first launched, but only 202 kits have been tested.According to the Wisconsin Sexual Assault Kit Initiative website, the most common reason tests were not submitted were:There are 2,327 kits that were not previously submitted for testing because of these reasons.Ian Henderson, Associate Director of Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault, explained the protocol for testing kits was changed to become more “victim-centered,” meaning victims can decide at any time to opt out of reporting sexual assault. This may explain why some of the kits were not tested.“One of the things we’ve been doing is trying to allow survivors as much choice as possible,” Henderson said. “For survivors who reported to law enforcement, those kits are going to be tested. It’s the ones where there was not a report at the time of when the kit was collected that are not being tested without victim consent, keeping in mind that survivor autonomy.”Sexual assault test kits can give people freedom, more control over assault
Though the state delayed processing almost 4,000 sexual assault kits, Wisconsin Department of Justice is now starting to test them Read…WiSAKI project site coordinator, Keeley Crowley, said there are also several reasons that testing for these kits have not progressed much, primarily being the time-intensive inventory process for logging all of the rape kits.“We were delayed a little bit because the one funding source did require us to complete a certified inventory, but it took them several months to give us the data parameters of that inventory,” Crowley said. “Because we were one of a handful to do this on a statewide level, it did take us a year to complete that inventory.”The inventory process required by the BJA collected case-specific details from all 557 law enforcement agencies throughout the state and was able to complete the inventory by March 2017.Additionally, the BJA required the grant could only be used for testing purposes, with $600 being the average cost of testing a kit.Wisconsin to test sexual assault kits, help victims ‘move forward’
Wisconsin Department of Justice started processing over 4,000 untested sexual assault kits Wednesday, which could be good news for victims Read…Crowley said processing the kits could take anywhere from two weeks to two months, with 45 days being the average time for processing a rape kit. She said processing time may vary because not every kit has the same quality or quantity of DNA evidence.Crowley said this is an important issue, however, because it’s hard for labs managing older inventory items when current rape kit submissions are on the rise.“The numbers are increasing and have been steadily going up over the past several years, I think partially because we are talking about the benefit of DNA testing more and more now,” Crowley said. “And local law enforcement is doing more investigations because they have more survivors coming forward to report, and they’re sending in more kits.In fact, Wisconsin has seen a dramatic increase in evidence submissions to the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory Bureau. From 2015 to 2016, submissions increased 49 percent, following a 31 percent increase the prior year.There are three laboratories in the WSCL system, but only the Madison and Milwaukee branches can properly process kits.These testing capacity issues have created a backlog in the inventory that goes as far back as 1988, and includes nearly 100 untested kits collected from before 2000.To address these issues, Crowley said WiSAKI prioritizes testing depending on the statute of limitations for each case, which is the period of time that can pass before a case may no longer be prosecuted. Under a new protocol, tests are kept up to 10 years in WSCL storage, which is the statute of limitations on second and third degree sexual assaults in Wisconsin.Democratic lawmakers request state audit of sexual assault kit backlog
Two Democratic state representatives requested a state audit, or official examination, of Wisconsin’s sexual assault kit testing backlog. State Rep. Read…To alleviate the backlog, Crowley said the state began contracting with an accredited Maryland-based laboratory, Bode Cellmark Forensics, to complete a majority of the testing for kits. About 200 kits are sent to the lab for testing each month.With the current contract WiSAKI has made with Bode, Crowley estimates all kit testing will be completed as early as September of next year.“Technology has certainly changed on what DNA can be tested in the past 30 years,” Crowley said. “So we have no idea in what condition some of the kits will be in [or] what collection was done, but if we can test them, we’re going to test them.”",DOJ launches website tracking backlog of untested sexual assault kits,UWM

The crime warning reported a sexual assault had occurred at an unknown fraternity and the suspect and the victim were known to each other. The warning clarified there was no investigation of the incident taking place because the victim did not express the desire to formally report the assault to authorities.A day later, another crime warning was sent out from the UWPD to inform students of a sexual assault in a southeast dorm. Similar to the first crime warning, the email stated that because the incident was reported to UW and not to law enforcement, there was no police investigation of the event. The email went on to declare that “sexual assault is never the fault of the victim,” and made some suggestions to create a safe, respectful campus environment including getting consent and speaking up in situations that don’t feel right.https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/10/18/doj-launches-website-tracking-backlog-of-untested-sexual-assault-kits/Two crime warnings in two days about sexual assault echo some of the events of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. The movements encourage victims of sexual assault to tell their stories for the purpose of exposing the crushing realities of sexual harassment and pursuing accountability. Harvey Weinstein dominated the news for weeks as the number of women accusing him of sexual misconduct and harassment climbed even higher. The ongoing story shocked Americans, but this type of headline quickly ceased to be unique. In these monumental movements, survivors of sexual harassment, both men and women, are coming forward with stories that they have kept to themselves for years. They are demonstrating the potential of a community to rise up in solidarity with one another and demand change.These movements found their momentum at a pivotal time in history. The Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network reported  one out of every six American women have been the victim of an attempted or completed rape. Rape and sexual assault still happen all the time, outside the workplace and in, on-campus and off, to people of every gender, race, and socioeconomic status. That is exactly why the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements are still fighting. Sexual harassment as an issue doesn’t end with an actor being fired or a politician stepping down — it is a work in progress with emphasis on the work.https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2017/12/12/increasing-conversation-about-hypermasculinity-male-libido-central-to-fight-against-sexual-assault/College students have everything to do with the waves of accusations and exposure of sexual misconduct and harassment across the country. RAINN reports that college women ages 18-24 are at an elevated risk of sexual assault compared to all women in America. Nearly 23.1 percent of undergrad females and 5.4 percent of undergrad males “experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence, or incapacitation.”UW has joined the fight against sexual harassment, working to see some change in dismal statistics. Tour guides point out the emergency phones stationed all over campus. Freshmen are required to take an online seminar to learn about consent, how to avoid being a passive bystander and how to stay safe walking around Madison and around campus. University Health Services has a whole page full of resources for survivors of sexual assault. But at the end of the day, UW isn’t some special exception to these statistics. It’s a university where students get two emails in two days about on-campus sexual assaults.https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2017/10/17/if-youre-shocked-by-metoo-youre-actively-contributing-to-the-problem/As horrible as it was to hear about the events last week, and to experience for the survivors that reported them to the university, maybe it’s a good thing there have been more emails disclosing the reality of sexual assault and harassment than the university has received all year. Getting emails means that students are reporting what happened to them, even if they don’t want a police investigation. Getting emails means more people are willing to face the staggering statistics around sexual assault on college campuses and do something about them. Getting campus-wide emails means other survivors have a chance to see they are not alone and they will be heard and supported should they choose to report what happened to them.The two emails weren’t long, but they spoke so much louder in a time when thousands of people are forming movements to break the trend of silence and lack of accountability for perpetrators of sexual harassment.Juliet Dupont (jdupont@wisc.edu) is a freshman intending to major in political science and journalism.","In light of recent sexual assaults on campus, #MeToo, #TimesUp more important than ever",UWM

With that being said, I grew up in Santa Monica, California. I was fortunate enough to have received an education at Windward — a progressive high school. I have always been very grateful for my education, with one of many reasons being that my school made a very conscious effort to diversify our curriculum. One example of such efforts would be my AP English Language class in my junior year. The class was focused on intersectionality and was split into different units throughout the year including race, gender, sexuality, religion and ethnicity.We uncovered many important issues and read a myriad of books that helped us understand people similar and different from us. Being a white cis-gendered heterosexual woman, I did not always understand the problems people faced outside of my little bubble. Like any class, I came across opinions I did and did not agree with.

With the recent announcement of Republican Rebecca Kleefisch’s campaign for Governor of Wisconsin, state abortion rights will face challenges in Read…English classes at my school always included Socratic discussion, so I was privileged with the ability to talk to my peers about how they’ve experienced their identities. In addition, I was able to talk about my experience of being a woman, a Jew and a daughter of two immigrants from South Africa. Though many of my peers had overlapping identities, we all had different experiences with them.This Wisconsin bill is completely outrageous, and its impact would be devastating. As someone who has experienced the type of education the bill wants to require parental consent for, I can affirm learning about and from people who are different from myself has done nothing but enhance my ability to connect with other people. This is a skill I have taken with me to university and will use moving forward.Additionally, a lack of education about those who may be different causes us to “other” people. This problem is one of many that caused the Holocaust and many tragic attacks against those in the LGBTQ+ community, people of color and those who practice religions underrepresented in the United States.According to Rep. Robert Wittke, the bill is supposed to be a mechanism for those that disagree due to potential conflicting religious beliefs.“This is merely just a way to give parents a choice,” Wittke said in a WPR article.Critical Race Theory opponents twist meaning for political gain, discussions on race, diversity belong in classrooms

Even those who belong to families agreeing with religious notions against people belonging to the LGBTQ+ community may be struggling with their identity and do not have a place at home to express their thoughts and emotions.The recent rise in attacks against the LGBTQ+ community are unprecedented and the high rates of depression and suicide within the community are gut-wrenching. The way to stop these attacks and help those struggling with identity acceptance and love starts in the educational system. We need to learn and understand we are not so different from one another.I believe guardians of the students in the public school system have a right to know what the school is teaching their children because education is so important. But if consent is needed for classes that want to focus on the LGBTQ+ community in any way, then consent should be needed for all classes.UW expands sexual assault services to UHS, campus rape culture persists

https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/09/08/sexual-assault-reported-at-langdon-street-fraternity/,"Sep 8, 2016","A sexual assault reportedly occurred at a Langdon Street fraternity house Sept. 3 at around 12 a.m., according to a University of Wisconsin Police Department crime warning issued Thursday.The crime warning states that the sexual assault was reported to a Campus Security Authority, which are staff, faculty and students who are required under the Clery Act to “forward reports of crimes to designated offices on campus.”The crime warning also states that the victim may have been drugged.Because Campus Security Authorities are not part of a law enforcement unit, police are not currently investigating the case, UWPD spokesperson Marc Lovicott said.If the victim did decide to approach law enforcement, Lovicott said Madison Police Department would investigate since the reported assault occurred off-campus.UW provides a range of resources to individuals who have experienced sexual assault, Lovicott said, and UW’s number one goal is to make sure the victim is okay.“We hope they’ll accept those resources,” Lovicott said. “We hope they’ll eventually decide to come to the police and report what happened, but everybody chooses a little differently how they want to approach this horrific crime happening to them.”",Sexual assault reported at Langdon Street fraternity,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2021/09/23/the-looming-impact-of-2022-wisconsin-governor-race-on-state-abortion-rights/,"Sep 23, 2021","With the recent announcement of Republican Rebecca Kleefisch’s campaign for Governor of Wisconsin, state abortion rights will face challenges in the coming months.The former Lieutenant Governor, according to her official 2022 campaign webpage, “is well known for her pro-life record.” In fact, Kleefisch said on Sept. 9 to conservative radio host Mark Belling she would sign a heartbeat bill if elected governor.A so-called “heartbeat bill” is a piece of legislation very similar to the law recently passed in Texas banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected around the six-week mark. Not only is this time frame before most women even know they are pregnant, but this law harrowingly makes no exceptions for rape or incest.The national controversy over the Texas abortion ban and most importantly, the Supreme Court’s failure to block the law, will no doubt influence conservative, anti-abortion lawmakers of other states to act.UW campus shows signs that vaccinations are best in fight against COVID-19
After a year and a half of mostly online classes, University of Wisconsin administrators worried about how in-person classes would Read…In her interview with Belling, Kleefisch said Donna Rozar, a representative of the 69th district in the Wisconsin State Assembly, is in the process of formulating a heartbeat bill. If Kleefisch is elected, Republican state lawmakers like Rozar would likely propose anti-abortion “heartbeat bills” under her governorship.The news of Kleefisch’s strict abortion stance and her corresponding bid for Governor is a terrifying reality the women of Wisconsin are facing. Also, this news emphasizes the grave importance of this upcoming election.Thousands of women each year in Wisconsin rely on the already-sparse abortion services this state has to offer. According to most recent data, there are just six facilities to get an abortion at in the entire state, only three of which are clinics. In the case of a potential “heartbeat bill” making its way into law, abortions would be banned — no matter the circumstances of the pregnancy — once a heartbeat can be detected around six weeks.If this “heartbeat bill” resembles that of Texas, abortions would be banned regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy once a heartbeat can be detected at six weeks. The only exception would be to save the life of the woman if their pregnancy was going to be life threatening.Politicized 2021-23 Wisconsin state budget provides tax breaks for the wealthy

Tony Evers signed a heavily Republican-influenced 2021-23 state budget Read…A restrictive abortion bill like this could also create controversy when it comes to ethical healthcare. This bill places a higher value on an early fetal heartbeat than it does on the mental, emotional and physical wellbeing of the women who would be forced into the medical procedure of labor and delivery.Even if a woman were to become aware of the pregnancy before six weeks, Dr. Jennifer Villavicencio in her interview for The New York Times said, “forcing them to find out about a pregnancy and make a decision about how to manage it in a short period of time is antithetical to ethical care.”The abortion experience in a state where the practice isn’t fully funded is also often a painful one. An anonymous University of Wisconsin student once detailed her troubling abortion experience to “The Tab” to raise awareness. After becoming pregnant from an unsupportive relationship, she chose to get an abortion and had to face protesters outside the abortion clinic and condescending UW administrators.If heartbeat legislation similar to Texas’ law were to be enacted in Wisconsin, the bill also might not sympathize with victims of sexual assault who fall pregnant. It is estimated one in seven Wisconsin women are raped during their lives.Absentee ballot voting could increase participation and representation in our electoral system

Even if she isn’t able to get a heartbeat bill passed or isn’t elected at all, her pro-life campaign will increase support for lawmakers looking to limit abortion rights across the state.These changes will particularly affect female students at UW, who will lose the inherent right to choose what happens to their own body.

https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2021/10/19/uwpds-jaywalking-patrol-on-university-avenue-more-harm-than-good/,"Oct 19, 2021","In late September, the University of Wisconsin Police Department announced via Twitter that they would place officers on the street crossing corner of University Avenue between Charter and Mills to more strictly patrol jaywalking incidents during class change times. UWPD also said they would “start with warnings, but fines are possible.”It is a no-brainer that potentially dangerous incidents of jaywalking should never be encouraged, especially during busy times of the week when road traffic is at its peak and many students are heading to class. But the threat to possibly fine and cite students for simply trying to get to class is an unnecessary and rather exaggerated policing strategy.US universities come up short in comparison to international institutions
The United States’ higher education system and the universities tied to it are well known and respected internationally. With around Read…While UWPD said their intentions came from a concern for pedestrian safety, posting these officers is simply a way of policing minute crime. When it comes to minor offenses or any range of crime, people of color are often disproportionately targeted and reprimanded more harshly than others — including the issuance of citations and fines.After UWPD’s announcement, the UW-Madison BIPOC Coalition tweeted, “UWPD is threatening to cite students who are crossing in the only area they can due to construction. This could be avoided if the UW would redirect sidewalk traffic to ensure students don’t go this route but why do that when you can police black & brown students!”Ultimately, UWPD’s increased jaywalking patrol sets up the potential for Black and brown UW students to be racially targeted and disproportionately stopped, fined, confronted or even assaulted for the extremely minor offense. For this reason, police presence at this avenue crosswalk is unwelcomed by many at UW and should be extremely limited or completely removed.Another reason why it’s unwarranted to hand out fines for jaywalking at this crosswalk is construction currently crowds and blocks the sidewalks around this corner. With the huge crowds of students going to and from class, there is limited pedestrian walk space that is convenient, safe and quick for getting to classes.Yik Yak offers positive comedic community to students despite controversy

The Read…For many students trying to get to class on time, especially those with 15 minutes or less between classes, they may feel as if they have to chance it and illegally jaywalk. While jaywalking can be dangerous and shouldn’t be condoned or encouraged, there is obviously an issue with feasible pedestrian routes for students to get to and from class in this area.There are better ways to deal with this problem than to patrol, stop and possibly fine broke college students for trying to get to class the only way they can. Associated Students of Madison representative Jack Phillips tweeted in response to UWPD, “You’ve identified an engineering problem and want to punish people for interacting with the system as it was designed?”UWPD didn’t choose to work with the university or the city of Madison to better accommodate students with traffic redirections, traffic flow management, or safer walkway infrastructures in this campus area. Instead, they chose to address the wrong problem in the wrong way: policing and fining students for simply walking. Stopping kids from trying to get to class in this traffic-congested and heavily restricted pedestrian area is bordering on an abuse of power.UW expands sexual assault services to UHS, campus rape culture persists

At many times of the day, there are hoards of students constantly using this walk lane as one of the only feasible crossings to our classes due to the inconvenience of construction and sidewalk closures surrounding the area. There are also many lanes of traffic to cross that are often busy, obstructed and flowing inefficiently.A better solution to the issue of jaywalking on campus is to utilize city and university resources to make sure pedestrians are accommodated in these busy crossing areas where traffic is heavy and already dangerous.Potential solutions include the construction of safer and more efficient walkways on campus, University Avenue traffic flow management or class change accommodations. Policing students for trying to get to class in an area where they have very little pedestrian space is ultimately not the solution UWPD thinks it is.Hallie Claflin (hclaflin@wisc.edu) is a sophomore majoring in journalism and political science.",UWPD’s jaywalking patrol on University Avenue: More harm than good,UWM

Waking up on Valentine’s Day freshman year, the night before was vague.Puzzled, I looked around the room and saw my clothes laying on the ground — my first clue.Wearing a white T-shirt and basketball shorts that didn’t belong to me, I scrambled to grab my things to change in the bathroom. Next to a trash bin lay a second clue — an open condom wrapper.In the bathroom, I decided against changing when I noticed the odor of vomit and wine on my clothes. Looking in the mirror, makeup smudged and hair disheveled, I spotted a third clue — the marks on my neck.I realized the source of the pain between my legs.A recent survey conducted by the Association of American Universities revealed 27.6 percent of female undergraduates reported having experienced sexual assault during their time at University of Wisconsin.As alarming as the statistic may be, it does not come as a surprise to victim advocates who frequently hear the narratives of college sexual assaults.Report: More than one in four women sexually assaulted at UW
University of Wisconsin released data Monday, Sept. 21, showing nearly 28 percent of undergraduate females reported experiencing sexual assault involving force or Read…Carmen Hotvedt, manager for violence prevention and victim advocacy at University Health Services, has been working full-time against sexual assault on campus for almost 11 years.“What I’ve seen change is students step up and say ‘enough is enough.'”
Tonya SchmidtWhile she and her colleagues are not surprised by the AAU’s finding that one in four students experience sexual assault during college, Hotvedt said the reaction to the localized numbers of a national statistic among university officials has been serious.Tonya Schmidt, associate dean of students, has been working on the issue of sexual assault since she was an undergraduate and said a change in narrative seems to be happening both nationally and locally.“This is not something that is brand new on campus, not something that is increasing on campus; this is something that has been part of the landscape for a long time,” Schmidt said. “What I’ve seen change is I’ve seen students step up and say ‘enough is enough.'”Laura Dunn, a 2007 alumna of UW, has dedicated her life to advocating victims of sexual assault.Dunn founded Survjustice, an organization that provides legal assistance to survivors from campuses throughout the nation. In 2013, she had a victory on Capitol Hill with the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, which enables victims to appeal an outcome and requires schools to inform them of all available options.Her passion for this issue came out of her own personal experience at UW.One night during her freshman year, Dunn felt comfortable leaving with two trusted male friends after they had been heavily drinking at a fraternity party.But she was betrayed when the two men sexually assaulted her while she slipped in and out of consciousness.Dunn built up the courage to go to the dean’s office to report the crime 15 months later.A second betrayal came from the university after a nine-month investigation, when neither of the men faced punishment and one had already graduated.“We, as student survivors, are the ones that are truly holding schools accountable.”
Laura DunnIn many ways, Dunn’s situation is statistically typical of most assault cases, as is mine. Drinking is involved in nearly 75 percent of incidents and 40 percent of the time, the perpetrator is a friend or acquaintance.In 18 percent of incidents when penetration occurred by force, the victim was passed out all or part of the time.What’s rare about Dunn’s case is the fact that she came forward publicly. When an assault involved incapacitation, students reported the incident only 5 percent of the time.“We, as student survivors, are the ones that are truly holding schools accountable,” Dunn said. “And it’s really tragic to me that so many survivors had to share their stories publicly because it is such a hardship, in order to get justice.”Unlike Dunn, I chose not to turn to university officials. As a freshman, reporting didn’t cross my mind.But one thing was clear to me as I tried to piece together the night — when I left work and received the invitation to go out that night, I had not intended to wake up in that apartment the next morning.UWPD recently released its Annual Security and Fire Safety Report, which showed 72 criminal sex offenses were reported last year.That does not come close to the 27.6 percent result from AAU’s survey.But it confirms what UWPD and university officials were already aware of — a disparity between actual assaults and reported assaults.Marc Lovicott, UWPD spokesperson, acknowledged that sexual assault is one of the most underreported crimes they deal with.“If you look at the numbers … [in] the sexual assault climate survey, the numbers don’t match up,” Lovicott said.Sexual assault reported at residence hall

Investigations often face barriers when it comes to gathering sufficient evidence.Even if someone is uncertain about reporting, Lovicott said getting examined through the sexual assault nurse examiner at Meriter Hospital can help a case in the future by having forensic evidence.While every case that was reported to UWPD last year resulted in an arrest, many did not end in conviction. Cases are often denied by the District Attorney’s office for lack of evidence, which Lovicott said happens frequently.“The DA’s office has a higher standard in that they must by court of law prove beyond reasonable doubt that a crime happened,” Lovicott said.If a student chooses not to report to police, they may still take action through the dean’s office.Last year, 15 of the 165 sexual assault cases reported to UW were directly reported to UWPD. Thus far in 2015, only six of the 136 reports made to the university have been reported to UWPD.Despite challenges in prosecuting a sexual assault that is reported years after it occurred, changes in legislation are making it possible for victims to have more time to report the incident.On its way to joining 38 other states that have 10 years or more on statute of limitations for sexual assault reportings, the state Assembly passed a bill Oct. 1 that would extend the statute of limitations from six to 10 years.Sen. Devin LeMahieu, R-Wisconsin, who helped craft the bill, said one of his constituents came forward about an assault that happened to her in college, but was unable to prosecute due to the amount of time that passed.“She wanted, for all other victims who might be assaulted in the future, to tell her story to me and hopefully get the law changed on statute of limitations,” LeMahieu said. “Give a little more time for victims to have the strength to come forward and hopefully bring to justice the assailant who attacked them.”Hotvedt and Schmidt have both accumulated the weight of heavy stories of sexual assault experiences on campus.“There’s definitely a secondary trauma that comes with hearing these stories over and over again,” Schmidt said. “I never thought I would be put into a situation where I was actually adjudicating and investigating these cases; it’s been quite difficult. The reason I haven’t stopped though is because I know that there is a lot of work to do and I want to try and make a change in this area.”Hotvedt said it can be difficult, but she is empowered when she works with students who are able to find themselves in the healing process. When Hotvedt started at UW, she was the only full-time employee tasked with the focus of sexual assaults on campus.“There is so much power and bravery that survivors show in rejecting staying in silence, and that really is the key to change.”
Laura DunnA decade later, she said there has been significant change behind-the-scenes in the resources the university allocates to the issue.“I think there’s been a greater increase of staffing and resources that people might not be tracking,” Hotvedt said. “But certainly from my perspective there has been a really big change.Still, Dunn said she continues to see cases coming from students at her own alma mater.“They are better and they are working,”Dunn said. “But still not everyone feels safe, still not everyone feels comfortable. And they need to remember that. They need to keep pushing forward.”As a student, the feeling of exhaustion is mutual and the need to push forward is as urgent as ever. Too many of my peers have stories that are similar to mine and Dunn’s.Dunn, as a survivor, stands behind the power of sharing her story.“There is so much power and bravery that survivors show in rejecting staying in silence, and that really is the key to change,” Dunn said. “The more we speak out and the more we demand, not just settle — demand the utmost in our cases — the more things will change. It will be the difference between whether the next student generation is safe.”Applying the 27.6 percent to my graduating class, 4,150 of the 15,036 enrolled female undergraduates will have experienced sexual assault during their time at UW.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2018/12/04/education-secretary-devos-proposes-changes-to-title-ix-sexual-harassment-definition/,"Dec 4, 2018","In the face of intense backlash from many sexual assault prevention organizations in Wisconsin and throughout the country, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos recently proposed changes to Title IX protections which redefine sexual harassment.DeVos’ proposed the Title IX changes in mid-November. According to a U.S. Department of Education press release, her proposal will “provide clarity for schools, support for survivors and due process rights for all.”The most prominent modification in the proposal is a change in the definition of sexual harassment.According to the Rape Crisis Center, sexual harassment is defined under current Title IX protections as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.” DeVos suggested modifying the definition to “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the school’s education program or activity.”The Dane County Rape Crisis Center said the difference is that the new definition would make it more difficult for victims to prove that their experience falls under the term “sexual harassment.” Under the new rule, if a victim were to return to school, the sexual conduct isn’t technically denying their education — so it would no longer be considered sexual harassment.According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, 11.2 percent of college students are victims of rape or sexual assault. However, only about 20 percent of sexual assault cases on campus are reported, leaving the overall percentage of student survivors to be much higher.The RCC opposes all of DeVos’ proposed modifications to Title IX, claiming the changes will actively discourage victims — specifically students — from coming forward and reporting assault.“In the time of #MeToo and #TimesUp, with all the growth our country is continuing to achieve to stop sexual assault and harassment from growing, this is particularly offensive to us at the Rape Crisis Center,” the RCC statement said.UW renews participation in AAU sexual misconduct, assault campus climate survey
According to a University of Wisconsin Health Services press release, UW will participate again in the Association of American Universities Sexual Read…RCC added that the current administration should instead look for new efforts to end sexual assault on campus and find avenues to make reporting sexual assault less daunting. According to RCC, DeVos is doing the opposite.RCC Executive Director Erin Thornley Parisi said the RCC believes the proposed changes will be a deterrent for victims to report sexual misconduct, and that the DOE would backtrack progress made in the rights of victims on college campuses.“I am hoping that the university will take as strong a stance as possible against the changes,” Thornley Parisi said. “I hope they’ll use their discretion to their fullest ability to make sure that the rights of victims are still paramount.”Additionally, under DeVos’s proposal, accused individuals would be allowed to appeal and cross-examine their accuser through an intermediary. The RCC believes DeVos’s proposal shows extreme distrust in victims and opens an opportunity for re-traumatization of survivors.University of Wisconsin spokesperson Meredith McGlone said the university is still trying to understand how the changes may affect the UW System and procedures on campus.“UHS Survivor Services will continue to provide no-cost, confidential support to UW-Madison student survivors of sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence and/or stalking,” McGlone said.Out of 318 sexual assaults reported in 2017, UW was able to investigate 11, report finds
Of 318 reports of sexual assault on and off campus in 2017, 11 were investigated by the university, according to a report Read…UW Chancellor Rebecca Blank said Friday that the university has developed timely policies and practices — including effective prevention, survivor support and accountability efforts — to ensure the campus is free of harassment and violence.Additionally, UW’s Title IX Task Force will review DeVos’ proposal and investigate the significance of the proposed changes, UW System spokesperson Heather LaRoi said Friday.LaRoi stressed the UW System is committed to promoting policies and practices preventing sexual assault and misconduct.Ian Henderson, director of systems and policy at the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said his organization’s biggest concern is that schools will be let off the hook from addressing sexual harassment occurring at their institution.“It seems that the proposed rule changes really don’t have survivors’ interests at heart,” Henderson said. “It’s more about educational institutions and relieving them of responsibility.”Sexual assault reported in southeast residence hall

On Thursday, protesters gathered for the “Take Back the Night” march to the Capitol in support of Sexual Assault Awareness Read…The importance of the march, Long said, was to rectify the strength of women’s anger toward President Donald Trump. If communities organize, that same strength could “take Brett Kavanaugh down.”University of Wisconsin alumni and ISO organizer Kim Gasper-Rabuck also spoke at the protest. Observers and organizers cried as she recounted her multiple accounts of sexual assault — some of which happened during her time at UW.One in four women will experience sexual assault during their undergraduate career at UW.Out of 318 sexual assaults reported in 2017, UW was able to investigate 11, report finds
Of 318 reports of sexual assault on and off campus in 2017, 11 were investigated by the university, according to a report Read…“I feel more than disrespected,” Gasper-Rabuck said. “I feel like I’ve been erased.”One protester, who wished to remain anonymous, recounted her own assault at age fourteen.She came to the march because sexual literacy isn’t “up to standard.” She said she didn’t even realize her assault was sexual violence until she talked to someone about it.Another protester, who also wished to remain anonymous, said the Kavanaugh hearing Thursday reflected the overall treatment of sexual assault survivors in society.“I think that Kavanaugh being put onto the Supreme Court is a complete injustice, and really communicates what we think of survivors and perpetrators,” the protest said. “How we could completely ignore that, or in some ways encourage it in our culture, is appalling.”","‘Blame the system, not the victim’: UW students march in protest of Kavanaugh nomination",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2021/12/02/beyond-the-binary-gender-inclusive-community-expands-housing-options-for-trans-gender-nonconforming-residents/,"Dec 2, 2021","The to-do list for incoming freshmen preparing to come to campus is endless. Among many other things they must do before the fall, navigating the exciting adventure of college dorm life is at the top of this list.As incoming students peruse the vast array of housing options available for living on campus, freshmen will find many different ways to craft their residential experience. But they will also encounter two categories that cause some students’ first-year housing plans to come crashing down — “men” and “women” binary housing separation.This was the case for Jasper Huegerich, who identifies as non-binary. Huegerich wanted to evade these limiting and outdated paradigms. In their ideal college dorm life, they hoped to be surrounded by people who share their experiences and avoid unsafe situations stemming from the limiting designs of the current residence halls.Most residence halls at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are organized by single-sex clusters or wings, rooms and restrooms, with sometimes only one single-use bathroom on the first floor or none at all. While these standards are improving with newer residence halls having a single-use bathroom on each floor, remnants of the ingrained binary ideas of sex and gender still resonate in residence hall life at UW-Madison.The constricting structural nature of these residence hall options for students like Huegerich fail to accommodate the vast array of identities that exist on campus and in the world at large.“No matter which one I would be put into, it would still be wrong,” Huegerich said.But in a recent step forward, students were given another option in place of the limiting single-sex dichotomy.UW students and staff pioneered a pilot housing option this fall that challenges the assumptions of gendered housing by offering an open gender-inclusive housing setting beyond what has previously been available — an option that has proved to help foster a more welcoming campus for transgender, non-binary, genderqueer or gender-nonconforming students, or TGNC individuals.28 more spotsEach spring, newly admitted incoming students carry out the process of deciding where to live for the upcoming year. Roughly 90% of incoming freshmen choose to live on campus in the university residence halls, though that doesn’t mean the decision-making is necessarily easier. Students take many factors into consideration when ranking preferences for halls, such as location, culture, size, room type and price.But for LGBTQ+ students, particularly those who are TGNC, the housing selection process can have an added layer of complexity. Typically, room assignments — and sometimes whole floors — are determined by assigned sex with gendered bathrooms more readily available than all-gender or gender-neutral ones.Freshman Elliot Novak wanted to attend UW for what they saw as a more inclusive campus environment overall, but they still had concerns about what their future living arrangements would be once they arrived on campus. Novak knew if they ended up with a roommate, they’d have to have a conversation about their identity and set boundaries.But no such conversation was needed — they ended up assigned to a room within the university’s newest affinity community.“I was going through the different learning communities because my mom recommended looking for a gender-neutral option, since I don’t identify as male or female, and then I found the [Gender Inclusive Community] in Merit,” Novak said.The 2021-22 school year is the first year the Gender Inclusive Community, or GCI, was offered to students as a residence hall option.Located on the second floor of Merit Residence Hall, the GIC has space for 28 residents and features gender-neutral bathrooms. Roommates of any gender identity are placed together unless otherwise specified. Double rooms have a private bathroom and clusters of six single rooms share an all-gender bathroom.The Open House Learning Community in Phillips Hall is another option for LGBTQ+ inclusive housing at UW that opened in 2013. Open House has 29 residents and aims to create a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students by helping residents connect with university mentors and resources while introducing them to the field of gender and sexuality studies.The Open House differs from the GIC in that it is a Learning Community instead of an Affinity Community, so residents pay the additional $200 fee and can take a one-credit seminar course in which they learn about the previous and current struggles faced by the LGBTQ+ community, according to their website.The only requirement for residents to live in the GIC is to sign an agreement stating they will respect everyone’s identities regardless of whether those identities are always understood or not, Huegerich said. The GIC mostly serves as a space for TGNC students to live openly and safely but still offers Community Builders like all other residence halls.Sophomore Sherry Wong had applied for the Open House last year and was denied originally, but she was later contacted over the summer to see if she wanted to be a house fellow in the GIC.“There are people on the floor that don’t participate in any events and that’s totally fine because there’s no expectation for that,” Wong explained.The GIC is located in the Southeast neighborhood, allowing TGNC students more choice in which neighborhood they’d like to be in, instead of only having an option in Lakeshore, where the Open House is located.“I think the intention [of having GIC in Merit] is because we have Open House on Lakeshore side, that we have something similar to serve the queer community in the Southeast side,” Wong said.A growing movementUW-Madison is not the only institution expanding gender-inclusive housing initiatives. Across the country, TGNC students come to college seeking community and safe housing. In the best interest for those TGNC students, this type of housing has become more common and widespread in recent years.Oliverferd Graham is a sophomore who found many of their friends in gender-inclusive housing during their time at UW-La Crosse.“I wasn’t really out at the time and I’m from a small town area with a below-1,000 population, so there wasn’t many gay or queer people around, so I kind of wanted to go into gender-inclusive housing so I could surround myself with people who are like me … and it worked,” Graham said.UW-La Crosse Director of LGBTQA Services Willem Van Roosenbeek said the university has offered gender-inclusive housing since the fall of 2013 — the same year Open House started.Also a part of the UW System, UW-Eau Claire offers multiple housing opportunities for queer students. There are both gender-inclusive apartments and suites and multiple Rainbow Floors, with one for the general LGBTQ+ community and one specific to TGNC students, according to UW-Eau Claire’s housing website.But UW-La Crosse, UW-Eau Claire and UW-Madison’s current gender-inclusive housing are far from the first kinds offered at higher education institutions across the nation and state.Housing to accommodate gay, lesbian and bisexual students was first offered by University of Massechussetts Amherst in 1993. Wesleyan College was the first institution to address the needs and experiences of TGNC students back in 2003, according to an article from Insight Into Diversity.At the forefront of gender-inclusive housing in Wisconsin, Lawrence University, located in Appleton, adopted gender-neutral housing for all of its residents in 2006.Creating care and communityAfter feeling isolated in the UW-Madison housing system for years, support, connection and safety are high priorities for students who identify as TNGC or intersex.In the GIC, Huegerich said they were placed with a roommate whom they get along with very well and who is also non-binary. They said this has been highly beneficial for them because going into this year, they knew they wanted to be surrounded by people who have similar experiences with gender.“I know that if Madison didn’t have gender-inclusive housing, I probably would’ve looked into other schools just because I would want to make sure that was something that I had,” Huegerich said.Similarly, Wong said her placement as the GIC’s House Fellow is a step up from her housing situation as a freshman, where she was in a single room in Adams’ International Learning Community. She only had to share a bathroom with three other people but still felt nervous about the potential risks associated with living in a cisgender majority housing unit.Other residents echoed Wong’s sentiments — safety and security are key benefits of gender-inclusive housing.“I know that Madison is known for being inclusive … but that’s the institution at large and it doesn’t account for [that] I can still run into people who are unfriendly,” Huegerich said.The GIC itself also provides many opportunities for residents to meet each other and connect with their House Fellow by holding smaller events, such as game nights and a trip to the farmers’ market, Huegerich said.While Novak hasn’t been able to go to too many events due to their work schedule, they have reached out to their House Fellow several times for support.“It’s nice having someone that’s also LGBT [as a] House Fellow … to know that your House Fellow understands the things you’re going through on top of school and a pandemic,” Novak said.Bea Lazarski/The Badger HeraldThe GIC has also opened itself up to the wider queer community on campus. For example, all students were welcomed to the GIC’s Fall Activity Fair which was held this October in collaboration with the Gender and Sexuality Campus Center.The GIC works closely with the GSCC to serve as a valuable resource for residents and other LGBTQ+ students because it allows for building connections with the wider queer community across campus and prevents LGBTQ+ students from being isolated from each other, said Lee Marty, Huegerich’s roommate.“It’s definitely nice to feel a deeper sense of community rather than just occasionally meeting queer and trans individuals,” Marty said. “There’s a lot of them in the other dorms and it’s not like you have to search [the community] out.”‘A lot of bureaucracy’Learning and affinity communities’ existence depends on significant interdepartmental coordination and responsiveness to what the student body indicates it desires or requires. This includes accounting for current, incoming and prospective students.The GIC in Merit was able to be introduced to UW because of the committee for campus gender-inclusive housing. The committee, which formed back in the fall of 2020, was established in order to address concerns students had about the existing gender-inclusive housing on campus.“The university is trying its best … and it’s nice to see that they’re actually putting a concerted effort into supporting their queer students and students of color and hopefully the intersections that happen there,” Wong said. “Unfortunately there’s a lot of bureaucracy.”GSCC program coordinator Whitney Anderson and assistant director of Residence Life Scott Seyforth serve as the co-chairs on the committee. But Anderson emphasized that her and Seyforth’s title as co-chairs is used loosely — the bulk of the committee consists of students from Associated Students of Madison and staff from the Housing Assignments office.Wong is also on the committee to offer her own perspective as the GIC’s current House Fellow. Anderson said they were deliberate in shaping an integrative committee that centered student voices.“This [committee] really started out of student activism and expressed student needs of expanding the gender-inclusive offerings in University Housing beyond Open House,” Anderson said. “Folks were appreciative of Open House, but that wasn’t meeting the many differing needs of students.”Seyforth said another focus of the committee is being open on the website about what gender-inclusive housing is available and making sure that information is accessible. This way, prospective students know exactly what their options are.Anderson said the committee is looking for feedback from students who are participating in what is intended to be a pilot year for the Gender Inclusive Community. The group is also looking at coordinating with other universities in the UW System.Progress doesn’t mean perfectIn addition to the reality that hostility can permeate elsewhere on a campus, the existing gender-inclusive housing is not automatically utopian. Queer spaces can still alienate or exclude people with other marginalized identities and fall short of ensuring the safety component.Current GIC residents point to more inclusion as an area for the GIC to improve upon, particularly from the lens of accessibility. Marty described Merit as a currently unappealing location for people with limited mobility, which they said they believe could potentially exclude some TGNC students with disabilities.Marty said Merit’s elevator seems like it is not wide enough for most wheelchairs. They also said both types of restrooms — shared gender-neutral bathrooms and private ones in the double rooms — are lacking in accessibility, as they have very narrow showers and missing handlebars.Merit last underwent ADA upgrades during its renovation in 2010, which included some bathroom redesign and making a few resident doors wider, according to University Housing Director of Marketing & Communications Brendon Dybdahl. In some cases, handlebars or shower seats can be added to bathrooms if lacking, Dybdahl said.Dybdahl said Housing works closely with McBurney Disability Resource Center to fully meet accessibility needs of students, and if a student with specific accommodations wishes to live in the GIC, they should communicate directly with Housing.Marty also said gender-inclusive housing needs to address how to be more inclusive and accommodating for queer people of color, as the current population of the GIC and Open House is almost exclusively white.Wong expressed how being a person of color at a predominantly white institution is taxing, so it is key to ensure that what is supposed to be an inclusive living environment is taking a more intersectional approach.As a mixed Black person, Marty said they are one of the only students of color in the GIC — which isn’t a coincidence.“There is a Black LGBT community at Madison that’s involved with the GSCC events and such, but there’s nobody [from the Black LGBT community] in Open House or in Merit,” Marty said. “The thing with LGBT Black students is that clusters of white people … stress them out.”Some students say colleges and universities merely offering gender-inclusive housing isn’t enough.Institutions need to devote time and effort into ensuring that it is the safe space it’s meant to be, according to Annika Koenen, who is a sophomore at UW-La Crosse and second-year gender-inclusive housing resident.“The fact that they have gender-inclusive housing and one single gender-neutral bathroom on the floor is the bare minimum,” Koenen said.Moving forwardIn addition to improving the GIC by addressing other marginalized identities that intersect with the queer experience, residents of existing complexes say there is still an unmet need for gender-inclusive housing at UW-Madison at large.Marty said one of their friends, who wanted to live in the GIC but wasn’t able to apply early enough, has had a difficult and tense time navigating campus while living with mostly cisgender people.“There was an instance in which I was really frightened for them because they were misgendered and it was messy,” Marty said.Next year, the gender-inclusive housing committee plans to further expand gender-inclusive housing choices. Seyforth said the second floor of Merit will stay as the GIC, but the university is hoping to offer gender-inclusive housing in other residence halls.According to Seyforth, the committee is hoping to make sections of residence halls such as Smith Hall gender-inclusive offerings, where two to three rooms share a bathroom. Currently, these “pods” are distinguished by binary sex. Instead, some “pods” would be designated as gender-inclusive with everyone in the “pod” sharing a gender-neutral bathroom instead of a male or female bathroom.Students who want to be in gender-inclusive housing can continue to indicate that preference on the housing application, just as they would with hall, room and community preferences, Seyforth said.Regardless of whether or not queer students choose gender-inclusive housing with whatever expansions happen next year, Marty emphasizes it will always be an opening and welcoming space for those who want to find a sense of community on the UW-Madison campus.“If people are thinking about going into gender-inclusive housing, just know we’re here,” Marty said. “And if people don’t want to go into gender-inclusive housing and just want a space to mellow out, also, we’re here.”","Beyond the Binary: Gender Inclusive Community expands housing options for trans, gender-nonconforming residents",UWM

https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2015/10/20/inside-27-6-sexual-assault-is-a-problem-regardless-of-statistics/,"Oct 20, 2015","“Please read: Sexual Assault Survey Results.”Recently, these words found their way into your Wiscmail’s subject bar. Whether you read it yourself or heard from a friend, the contents of this email are now known campus-wide. The highlight of the message is the lasting numerical statistic, a four character summary of sexual assault at the University of Wisconsin: 27.6 percent.This number is representative of the percentage of female undergraduates who, during the 2014-15 school year, indicated via the Association of American Universities Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct that they had experienced sexual assault since arriving on campus.The statistic could be the reason you go about your day in distress, mulling over a figure so obscene and dangerous. It might be that you’ve known this since your freshman orientation; nearly every student in America has heard the infamous “one in four” statistic by the time they begin college.Maybe you spend the day thinking of your best friend, your sister or even yourself. Or maybe you already heard about this from the Tonight Program and now it’s old news; maybe statistics like these just don’t mean much to you anymore and you just … go about your day.Our constant awareness of sexual assault comes with a lofty price. While colleges nationwide work daily to raise awareness of this issue, an unavoidable consequence of this campaign has become gradual, but powerful, audience desensitization.One cat-call is one too many, and one assault of any nature is one too many.Nearly every day, figures like 27.6 percent float around campus inboxes all over the country, not to mention grandiose headlines littering our Facebook feeds. Reactions to these increasingly frequent figures are becoming increasingly apathetic, as we shake our sad, progressive heads in woe, toss the link a sympathetic like and halfheartedly continue switching between the same five apps until we’ve forgotten.Interestingly enough, the authors of the AAU survey now tell a slightly different story in the wake of the results: “Estimates such as ‘1 in 5’ or ‘1 in 4’ as a global rate [are] over-simplistic, if not misleading.” Further, “none of the studies which generate estimates for specific [institutes of higher education] are nationally representative.”Honestly, not a surprising conclusion.First and foremost, a mere 19.3 percent of students contacted around the country replied, with a slightly above average response rate of around 22 percent at UW.Any freshman with a basic level of understanding of survey methods and statistics is well aware that a survey hinging on voluntary response will never be free of third variables.Dean’s office calls for student voice in revisions to sexual assault conduct code
With University of Wisconsin’s student conduct code regarding sexual assault undergoing major revisions, the dean’s office looked to student government’s Read…In all likelihood, women who have experienced sexual assault feel the most compelled to respond to such a survey, compared to a student who has not faced similar trauma.The AAU acknowledges this, saying “estimates may be too high because non-victims may have been less likely to participate.” Secondly, the survey defines sexual assault as “nonconsensual sexual contact involving [either] sexual penetration [or] sexual touching.” The AAU takes enormous care to never mention the words “rape” or “assault” in any question or answer, which is problematic as it fails to consider the spectrum of severity associated with sexual assault.Under this term, a traumatic rape and drunken waist grab are categorically equal. In no way does this suggest that level of intoxication, relationship to a perpetrator or duration of nonconsensual behavior undermines a sexual assault — so long as the victim feels violated, assault is assault and any level of unwanted sexual advance is unacceptable.Rejecting silence: Student survivors take control, speak out on sexual violence
Editor’s note: Trigger warning for sexual assault.  Waking up on Valentine’s Day freshman year, the night before was vague. Puzzled, I looked Read…But as the survey’s authors acknowledge, they may have lumped girls who would not label themselves as victims into the same category as those who suffer immense emotional trauma and violence.Perhaps rendering a response,“So? Whether or not they know it, they’re still a victim.”Which is valid under many pretenses, but not this one. The reality is that of this precarious 27.6 percent of women, we can assume some were not intending to report an assault — they were confirming misogynistic behavior which is undoubtedly disgusting and disrespectful — being hit on, for example — but not physically threatening as far as assault goes.Which may prompt a reaction as ignorant as: “Oh, the percentage is actually even lower? Great! So it’s not even as a big a deal as everyone says it was. Damn propaganda. It’s 2015. Women can vote. My mom even owns land. Things are awesome; America is amazing.”Hold on. Take it back it a notch (or 12).You’re right, I’m not suggesting 27.6 percent is a completely accurate figure. In fact, I’m suggesting 100 percent is far more pertinent.While the results of this survey don’t confirm that one in four girls are whisked into a car and violently assaulted at UW, they confirm something potentially more dangerous.If you found out that just 10 to 15 percent of that 27.6 percent actually referred to assault or rape as you may think of it, would you care less? Would this diminished percentage make it seem as though we have made progress, as though women are safer?That’s the issue we face. In the world we live in, nothing matters anymore without the support of an impressive statistic — a number bigger than you ever imagined — when really, if rape was occurring at a rate of 4 percent, it would be 4 percent higher than it should be.University of Wisconsin under federal investigation for handling of sexual assault cases
With three open federal investigations into possible violations in handling sexual assault cases, the University of Wisconsin has the fourth highest Read…Rape isn’t a big deal because it’s happening to one in four women. Rape is a big deal because it’s happening.On the chance you followed the hyperlink in the email to the full report and data tables, you probably found several statistics even more shocking. At one of the most liberal and progressive schools in the Midwest, one which prides itself on social equality and awareness, 40 percent of students don’t believe that a victim of assault would be supported in the community. One in three women on campus have doubts that UW officials would take their report seriously, in the event they choose to report it.Rape isn’t a big deal because it’s happening to one in four women. Rape is a big deal because it’s happening.Even more distressing is only 28 percent of female graduate students believe campus officials would take action to prevent factors that lead to sexual misconduct in the first place, astonishing evidence of how comfortable we have become accepting this behavior as just a part of college life.And on each of these parameters, men are significantly more optimistic — a revealing indication that male perception seemingly continues to dictate the conditions and repercussions of sexual assault, significantly more so than victim’s experiences.So we don’t just need to reconsider our sympathetic complacency towards sexual assault. We need to tear it up and start a new page.One cat-call is one too many, and one assault of any nature is one too many.Surveys, deans and newspapers shouldn’t feel pressure to churn out these startling figures. Instead, we need to integrate systems of support and education into our institution’s policies — to ensure that next year’s survey doesn’t still indicate that only 67.4 percent of students intervened when they were witness to a sexual assault.That number should be the highest on the survey, coming in at 100 percent, and that is a number deserving of email recognition.We will not anticipate sexual assault as though it is a scraped knee. Sexual assault is not a certainty, and sure as hell shouldn’t be a part of life. That isn’t to say we forgo preparation, but it is certainly to say that until we dispose of our complacency and acceptance, each of us remains a silent perpetrator.Whether or not you believe it is misleading, 27.6 percent may illuminate our shortcomings, but it does not need to set a baseline for the future.We aren’t aiming to watch this number drop. In fact, we aren’t aiming to watch this number at all.We’re aiming for our best friends, our sisters, our lab partners and our TA’s to walk home past 10 p.m. without having to clutch their cell phones, to never verbally consent out of fear of being labelled a prude, to never have to stay up at night asking why they drank that, why they wore that, why they smiled like that or why they left their house at all.And when that becomes the goal, the statistics will change all on their own.Yusra Murad (ymurad@wisc.edu) is a sophomore majoring in psychology and business.",Time to tear up sympathetic complacency towards sexual assault,UWM

University of Wisconsin student Benjamin Horn is facing two counts of sexual assault of an intoxicated victim after charges were Read…In 2018, there were four hate crimes reported that “qualified for inclusion,” according to the report. Three were attributed to bias against race: one simple assault on public property, one aggravated assault on campus, and one rape on campus. The fourth hate crime, a simple assault on campus, was reportedly motivated by bias against sexual orientation.This is a significant decrease compared to 2016, when 20 hate crimes were reported. Four were attributed to bias against race, one to bias against national origin, one to bias against gender and 14 — all of which were vandalism — to bias against religion.UWPD Captain Ruth Ewing said one reason for the high number of reports is that 14 reports of vandalism were all committed by the same person. Those acts, the report said, were motivated by anti-Semitic bias.“There’s always efforts on our part and the institutions part to work and strive towards getting the [hate crime] number down,” Ewing said. “We have different campaigns that we run that tie into hate crimes, and prevention. Right now, we’re doing a multi-faceted campaign that ties hate crimes and bias, sexual assault, bystander intervention, all into those areas. It’s called Be that Badger … we’ve got these messages on posters, bus ads, and there’s different slogans that are sort of reminding students to understand consent, be respectful to others, and step in when people need help.”Steering clear of the cliff: UW strives to educate students on ‘clear and obvious’ consent despite limited legal language
A quick stroll through the Student Activity Center will reveal they’ve done some redecorating. Whereas the construction of the new Read…According to the report, in 2018, there were 13 rape offenses reported on campus property, 10 of which occurred in student housing. Four rapes were also reported as occurring off-campus. In comparison, 2016 saw nearly half as many rapes: seven occurred on campus, and six of those were in student housing. No rapes on public property or off campus were reported. Ewing noted that increases in statistics do not necessarily correlate to an uptick in crime when looking at underreported crimes. In fact, Ewing said a rise in reports could even be positive.“Sexual assault is the number one underreported crime on a college campus. So, we [can] see it as actually a really good thing when the numbers go up, because it means that the efforts by the police, the institution to encourage people to report it are possibly being heard, that victims of the crime feel more comfortable using the resources and reporting the crimes, and that people are more willing to talk about it,” Ewing said. “It’s hard to say whether or not the number reflects the actual number of cases — it’s probably still under what actually is happening, but when the [reported] numbers go up, it can be good.”According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, rape is the most under-reported crime, as 63% of sexual assaults are not reported to police.Boyer said any institution complying with the Clery Act, UW included, can take certain steps in compliance and also with campus safety.“We provide educational tools, training, webinars, documents, and tons of tools that institutions can use. We always encourage a multidisciplinary approach to compliance with the Clery Act,” Boyer said. “We also know there are different challenges when it comes to different campuses, especially very small or very large ones.”Boyer added she had worked with “colleagues on the UW-Madison campus,” and had found through her work with larger campuses as a whole that making sure people knew who to report to, how to report, and that they could report and be supported was key.Ewing said UWPD has resources students can utilize, should they choose to.“So as a police agency, we’ve got a lot of different resources available, so we encourage students to utilize those. If you have questions about things, no question is one we’re willing to unanswer. We encourage people to report crimes, to intervene when they’re a bystander and see something going on, to call us when they’re unsure,” Ewing said. “If they’re not comfortable with the police department, there are other resources that they can take advantage of too.”","Annual UW report shows hate crime reports have dropped, while sex crime reports have increased",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2017/12/12/increasing-conversation-about-hypermasculinity-male-libido-central-to-fight-against-sexual-assault/,"Dec 12, 2017","Within the past few weeks, a slew of sexual assault allegations captivated the attention of the American public, literally spanning across the nation from politicians in Washington D.C. to entertainment moguls in Hollywood.Outcry, trials and firings are now becoming more commonplace in a society that is just beginning to understand the full impact that sexual assault has on the associations of the accused, and the wellbeing of the survivor. Though men are often survivors of sexual assault, unfortunately, this receives very little attention since most of the recent allegations involve women being targetted by men.Statistically, these are the most prevalent situations, both in greater society and on campus. According to It’s On Us, a national movement to end sexual assault, female students are more than four times as likely to be raped or sexually assaulted than male students. Now, the perpetrators are not inebriated frat boys or a seedy school janitor — they are men in respected industries, with different outlooks, backgrounds and values, bound by the common thread of their sexual misconduct.Whether it be on the evening news, the trending story on twitter or hot gossip at a coffee shop, the outpour of allegations are causing men to have a conversation that many are not ready or simply refuse to have — what is the true nature of the male libido?It’s on us to change the way we talk about sexual assault
It’s your typical trip home from the library on an October night, it’s nearly 1:30 a.m. when you throw on Read…The common stereotype is men have a natural inclination to crave sex, whether it be consciously or unconsciously. Freud describes it through the “Id,” the part of the personality that he calls “chaos, a cauldron full of seething excitations … [It is] the great reservoir of libido.” This idea is obviously fraught with generalization, but if anything, the events of the last few weeks seem to support its accuracy. Though we know better than to think this is true, why are men not acting on that?Societal expectations prompt men to act this way. From a very young age, we are taught to fear the male libido, in the form of subtext from our favorite stories. The Big Bad Wolf pursuing Little Red Riding Hood, or Sleeping Beauty being kissed awake all have blatantly sexual, yet non-consensual undertones. Children are terrified of werewolves, creatures that turn into insatiable beasts, and vampires that slip into your house in the middle of the night to satisfy their lust for human blood.Stories like these are so ingrained in our culture that it provides us with a subconscious expectation for men to be sex-crazed heathens, and women to be the meek victims. Both of those tropes are stereotypes, but ones we see more frequently. We know little about the true nature of male sexuality because of a lack of conversation and education on the reasons behind the roles and actions of sexual assault perpetrators caused by societal expectations that we have been consuming since childhood. To break the stigma against male hypermasculinity, we need to learn about why it exists, and how to curtail it.Education about these choices is the key to preventing future sexual assaults. For men, education on sexuality is abysmal. Sex education in middle or high school is more focused on pregnancy prevention, sexually transmitted diseases, or outright abstinence rather than consent or sexual health, a major disservice to all genders. After a lackluster education, men are then thrust into a society replete with expectations — be strong, be aggressive, do not be vulnerable, solve problems on your own.Defending sexual predators harmful, unproductive
Wednesday morning, the country woke up to news of Matt Lauer’s exit from the TODAY show. After years as a Read…A dialogue with other men on anything remotely related to sexuality is taboo. Because of this, our culture is having a large-scale public conversation on the sexual misconduct of men, without touching on the nature of male sexuality. We focus on the aftermath of assault, rather than determining why the assault takes place in the first place. We repress our urge to know and to understand, rather than face an ugly truth. Female survivors wish to share their experiences and have their voices heard, a completely valid desire, and many men run to their beck and call. This shifts the spotlight from their role in perpetuating this culture and the misunderstanding of their sexual practices.Survivor stories often drive the conversation on sexual assault forward, but focusing on only one side of the story does nothing for prevention. The dialogue on sexual assault prevention must acknowledge the lack of understanding of the male sexuality, and begin to mend it.An artists work should never be separated from their actions off screen

Hollywood is in the midst of Read…A constructive discussion by men on changing sexual norms would be beneficial for preventing sexual assaults, but it simply does not happen. Societal implications from childhood, education or lack thereof, may be explanations for the abominable behavior, but they are not excuses. Immersing ourselves in the suffering of survivors is important yet not the sole solution, for there is no way that healthy sexuality can occur in a culture where the roles of men and women regarding sexual relations are not understood equally.This sympathy is not meant to reduce or demean the experiences of sexual assault survivors — who know strength some of us will never understand — but to popularize the idea that masculinity and the dangers and misconceptions surrounding hypermasculinity is a relevant topic that is just as worthy of discussion as the experiences of survivors. All parts of male sexuality — the good, the bad and the ugly, are subjects worth talking about to prevent future sexual assaults.Abby Steinberg (asteinberg@badgerherald.com) is a freshman majoring in political science and intending to major in journalism.

The national rate of Native American women sexually assaulted is two and a half times higher than the overall national average, she said.In addition, Nelis said 80 percent of Native American women are sexually assaulted by people outside of their communities, a fact Nelis said differs from most sexual assault victims who often know the person who assaulted them.Samantha Pecone, a Wunk Sheek member, said it is hard to determine the exact reason for the higher rates of assault among Native American women, but she suspects one reason may be due to the hyper-sexualization of Native American women in the media.Nelis also said she believes Native American women are being highly sexualized by society.“You see Victoria Secret models with fake Native head dresses, Halloween costumes,” Nelis said. “All that just kind of creates the idea that Native women are sexualized, that Native women are objects and in turn our bodies are not respected as they should be.”Nelis claimed because the university has not made sexual assault a priority, Wunk Sheek has been working closely with the Multicultural Student Center and UHS to address this problem.The American Indian Campus and Community Coordinator Nichole Boyd and the Multicultural Student Center have taken on this problem, but Nelis said it is not enough.The university should be in charge of campus sexual assault and organizing events to spread awareness across campus, Nelis said.“To me, [the university’s lack of support] shows that Native American students on campus aren’t being represented as we should be,” Nelis said.",47 percent of female Native American UW students reported being sexually assaulted,UWM

At a University of Wisconsin student government committee meeting Monday, University Health Services proposed a two-year plan to financially back Read…If funding is approved, UHS would launch a new program called Green Dot aimed at increasing bystander intervention in situations where there is a risk of sexual assault, Van Orman said.Evidence from implementation at other institutions points to at least a marginal increase in bystander activeness as a result of the training. Van Orman said she hopes to implement it at all campus levels.According to Green Dot’s website, the training would focus on fostering a personal connection to the community, educating participants on current research and honing practical intervention skills.In addition, Van Orman said a concerted effort will be made to change the way students and faculty view the role of bystanders within the campus community through advertising and training.Rejecting silence: Student survivors take control, speak out on sexual violence
Editor’s note: Trigger warning for sexual assault.  Waking up on Valentine’s Day freshman year, the night before was vague. Puzzled, I looked Read…A significant portion of sexual assaults occur in campus housing, Van Orman said. Therefore, efforts to expand the Tonight program will hopefully better educate students on dealing with issues of consent. She said there is a comprehensive effort to provide 15 peer educators and additional prevention staff to bolster the attitudes the program teaches.Part of this effort includes “social norming,” which Van Orman said is a concerted effort to improve the sexual norms on campus and their importance.“If someone says something rape-affirming we step in, we say something and those are things we can deliver,” she said.Fraternities and sororities are also making a renewed effort to combat sexual assault through training and the creation of new positions. Sarah Laudon, a student on the Title IX advisory board, said Greek life efforts include creating special training for leaders within each organization on how to support and advise victims of sexual assault.‘Finally taking action’: Greek community to implement first major plan to address sexual assault

She said it is important to educate students on the role alcohol often plays in sexual assault.UHS must gain approval from student government before going to the chancellor for approval of new funding.","UHS unveils $400,000 initiative to curb sexual assault, gender-based violence",UWM

Students typically take time to relax during spring break, but with no break this year concerns are rising around mental Read…Students petition for Wellness DaysConcerns about mental health arose over the lack of spring break this year. After dealing with the pandemic for a year, students craved a break.A petition for “wellness days” was started by University of Wisconsin freshman Amelia Zanin, who felt “mentally drained.”The petition gained about 3,900 signatures, mostly from students. Other local campuses did not cancel spring break, according to the petition.While UW did schedule three wellness days, they were on Friday, Saturday and Sunday which didn’t help out the average student much. The petition called for a longer break.Another petitioner, UW sophomore Teddy Brodzinski, said the university showed disregard for students, and many students still had spring break plans regardless of the cancellation of instruction due to the nature of online classes.UW Director of News and Media Relations Meredith McGlone said any change in the spring calendar at that point in the semester would disrupt classes.Assistant Vice Chancellor of University Communications John Lucas said when the decision to cancel spring break was made in September, they did not anticipate the stress students would feel due to the lack of a break. Lucas added that faculty are also tired.Other staff supported the decision, including Director of Research Communications Kelly Tyrell. If students traveled, it could lead to higher infection rates and potentially another shutdown, Tyrell said.“Our responsibility on campus is to consider both the needs of our individual students and our individual faculty members and also the needs of our greater community,” Tyrell said.In effort to make the rest of the semester feel more manageable for students, the Provost Office sent instructors a message encouraging them to promote student wellbeing, Lucas said. It emphasized the importance of mental health, especially at this time in the semester.SARJ petitions to rename Women’s Health Clinic to promote more inclusive care

She believes the proposed new name would reflect that not all people who need reproductive healthcare services identify as women.SARJ President Maya Cherins was frustrated with the initial response SARJ received from their contact with UHS, and believes the response was empty and did not show UHS was listening.In the email statement to SARJ, Interim Director of UHS Patrick Kelly said UHS is committed to providing a welcoming environment for the entire campus community so all students are able to access the medical services that are provided. According to Kelly, the university’s medical trans team worked to make sure the services provided by the Women’s Health Clinic are accessible in a safe space.Head of the UHS Marketing and Health Communications Team Marlena Holden said the Health Care Advisory Committee is supportive of looking into more inclusive names.Cherins heard a lot of positive feedback from the student body about the petition, including from gender-diverse students who believe the name change would benefit them. Many of the students she talked to believe the change would be a good thing and see it as long overdue.In their petition, SARJ stated the proposed change is not an immediate solution to reproductive injustices but it is a step in the right direction.UW Libraries announce call for proposals for contributions of essays focused on students’ experiences

Students with multiple identities in gender, sexual orientation, disability, income status or other marginalized groups are also strongly encouraged to contribute, according to the project’s press release.Students interested in the project can submit their proposals in three areas — context, voices or towards justice. The sections allow students to address BIPOC history, identity and how to address justice and liberation.The Division of Diversity, Equity and Educational Achievement will compensate students who participate $200 through an Innovation Grant.The project hopes to aid the UW Student Inclusion Coalition’s priority of addressing racism and discrimination that BIPOC students face on campus. In October 2020, SIC released the ‘Home is Where WI Aren’t’ video showing a list of things UW needed to do to provide all students with a more inclusive campus.After the formation of SIC in 2019, this project was conceptualized by Landsdown.UWPD to require additional vetting for officers at UW football games

In September of 2020, the Associated Students of Madison passed a vote of no confidence in UWPD.This fall, UWPD said it will take steps to ensure officers who are called in from various cities and towns across Wisconsin on game days have not previously violated civil rights or been cited for the use of excessive force.The initiative came to fruition after UW athletics requested an in-depth review of the vetting process for police officers arriving from outside of Madison on game days.UWPD said they felt a need to bring in additional officers for home football games because the increased activity on campus heightens the possibility of criminal acts occurring. A study conducted by the University of Kentucky concluded that seven more crimes are reported during home games than away games on college campuses.Madison in particular has a reputation for disorderly conduct during football games. In 2016, 344 fans were ejected from Camp Randall Stadium — a figure higher than the national average.Several UW students, including ASM chair Matthew Mitnick, voiced concerns that UWPD may fail to deliver on its promises for reform. Mitnick said he is unsatisfied with the statements UWPD issued and hopes to see concrete action.“That’s just playing politics,” Mitnick said.Nurses at UnityPoint Health – Meriter Hospital agree to ratify a two-year agreement following weeks of debate

Read…Nurses at UnityPoint Health – Meriter Hospital agree to ratify a two-year agreement following weeks of debateA group of Nurses at UnityPoint Health – Meriter Hospital spent weeks negotiating a two-year contractual agreement between themselves and their employer in late March.Over 98% of nursing staff voted to allow the existing contract to expire in the hopes of drawing up a new arrangement which would improve worker protections following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.Requests made by the nurses included longer paid sick leave, higher salaries and replenished medical leave for employees who exhausted their time off due to health complications related to COVID-19.Several nurses also alleged their employer, Meriter Hospital, harassed and attempted to intimidate employees seeking bolstered benefits.The new contract includes several key provisions: nurses can renegotiate contracts in the event of another pandemic, financial incentives were added for overtime work, a 2.6% wage increase was implemented and nurses will receive greater financial support should they choose to pursue higher education.The push for a more labor-friendly contract was spearheaded by the Service Employees International Union’s Wisconsin chapter. SEIU is currently the fastest growing healthcare labor union, with 15,000 members in Wisconsin alone.SEIU Wisconsin co-chair, Suzi Kossel said her organization plans to support the efforts of other nurses in hospitals statewide to unionize and collectively bargain.“UW and St. Mary’s nurses both deserve the ability to unionize and the nurses at Meriter are in full support and look forward to advocating for their voices as well,” Kossel said.UW organizations respond to Atlanta shootings, provide support to the APIDA community

The UW Division of Diversity, Equity & Educational Experience also published a statement discussing the shootings, encouraging students to attend their monthly affinity sessions.UW released its own statement regarding the Atlanta attacks and the overall spike in violence targeting Asian Americans, however, many students were unimpressed by UW’s written sentiments.“Some of the statements [UW] released were tone-deaf at best and just didn’t really cover what I hoped the university would cover,” UW student, Meun Wang said.Students also grew frustrated with what some described as “pop-up” mental health services for students of color on campus following tragedies.UW student Lisa Yang said she believes UW could improve the campus experience for Asian American students if the university were willing to invest in permanent mental wellness infrastructure long term.“I think it’s really messed up that [UW] keeps doing these crisis pop-ups for mental health when they can systematically really invest in therapists for our communities,” Yang said.",The Semester That Was,UWM

With three open federal investigations into possible violations in handling sexual assault cases, the University of Wisconsin has the fourth highest Read…UW is currently one of 173 U.S. colleges and universities that federal authorities are investigating for the handling of sexual assault complaints, SurvJustice staff attorney Myka Held said. SurvJustice is a national not-for-profit organization focused on achieving justice for survivors of sexual violence.In most Title IX investigations, Department of Education investigators negotiate a resolution agreement for schools or universities in violation of federal law so they do not lose their federal funding, Held said.Typically, these negotiations include policy changes for more campus awareness.Held added that universities can improve their handling of sexual assault cases by better meeting Department of Education standards.“I think schools have to want to work with the government,” Held said. “Right now … the UW school system in violation of Title IX because they allow respondents to appeal a decision but not complainants.”Carmen Hotvedt, manager of Violence and Victim Advocacy at University Health Services, viewed sexual assault investigations as a survivor’s positive exercise of civil rights — not as bad publicity for universities, as many perceive, she said.Survivors can use a federal complaint to investigate their perceived injustice — an opportunity Hotvedt said she welcomes when students feel like their right to a discrimination-free education is in question.She said she hopes the outcomes of these investigations help improve UW’s response to sexual assault cases.“I don’t always know that it’s a negative thing to have these civil rights investigations,” Hotvedt said. “It means that students came forward and said, ‘This isn’t okay, and help me address it and help … make the campus better.”Valyncia Raphael, a conduct coordinator in the UW Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, said universities must take the first steps in preventing sexual assault, instead of waiting to act until survivors come forward, or federal funding comes into question.“A university will only change their policies unless their federal funding is dangled in front of them,” Raphael said. “We’ve got to stop that because it’s the right thing to do and our students are suffering in silence.”‘Finally taking action’: Greek community to implement first major plan to address sexual assault
While Greek life communities across the nation have long been criticized for higher rates of sexual assault, few comprehensive studies Read…Multicultural Student Center Associate director Robert Brown said UW needs to acknowledge its party school reputation and that it plays a role in addressing sexual assault on campus.Alcohol is the number one date rape drug and a big facilitator in cases of sexual assault, PAVE Chair Sophie Nielsen said. Instead of calling for abstaining from alcohol, UW and other universities should highlight the ways that alcohol can be used to take advantage of others, she said.Nielson recalled how at UW’s incoming-student orientation, students were taught how alcohol is often involved in sexual assault cases and how students shouldn’t drink because it is “evil.” She said a better approach would be for house fellows to promote constructive conversations about alcohol rather than simply writing students up.Brown said the university’s current “shaming” stance on alcohol is ineffective. Instead of focusing on encouraging students not to drink, the university should focus on the motivations behind drinking.He said heavy drinking on campus has become the norm, especially among males, who are especially pushed to drink because of stereotypes of masculinity.“If I drink less, that makes me less of a man, which is inherently misogynistic and sexist,” Brown said.Anders Kristensen, president of We’re Better Than That: Men Against Sexual Assault, said UW needs to provide more education on prevention specifically geared toward students.But he added that the student body is responsible as well. Male students in particular, he said, must acknowledge that sexual assault is a large problem on campus.“I think it’s very important that we realize this is a student problem,” Kristensen said. “It’s not a problem in administration. The effects that are felt are around campus, those are students that feel these effects, and it is also students that are committing these crimes.”Brown said discussions help create an atmosphere of mutual support where students can learn how to properly handle and prevent sexual assault.“That whole notion of asking for help tends to be a huge barrier,” Brown said. “Thinking about some of those root causes and how that perpetuates this same cycle is something that I would offer to this conversation.”",Panel tackles how to put a stop to sexual assault at UW,UWM

It’s not because I don’t try to understand or empathize, rather it’s because as a man, I simply am not subjected to the same atrocities that women are.I’m not sure I should be saying anything on this topic at all. I’ve never been a survivor of sexual assault so I can’t necessarily empathize with those who have.

With around 20 million students enrolled in U.S. colleges — a number steadily increasing — the American higher education system is being chosen by more and more people every year. It is also extremely different from any other college system around the world.How exactly is college in the U.S. different from those abroad? Are these differences inherently good? And how is America’s system viewed as a whole, not only in the U.S. but around the world? In examination of how U.S. colleges shape up against their competitors abroad, there are some crucial deficiencies within our system of higher education that remain largely unaddressed even as enrollment numbers continue to climb.With Wisconsin tuition freeze set in stone, out-of-state students likely to pay the price again

Tony Evers and Wisconsin legislators decided to return power to Read…While all countries have different requirements and processes, there are a few key things that set America apart from most other nations in regards to how our colleges work.For one, it is highly uncommon to come into university undeclared anywhere outside of the United States. Most colleges abroad allow students to start on coursework directly related to their field of study right away and don’t have the general education requirements that almost all U.S. universities do. Because of this, it usually takes students much less time to obtain a bachelor’s abroad than it does in the U.S. The cost of college is also starkly different in the U.S. than in most other countries. Some colleges in Europe, for example, have made their state schools essentially tuition-free — a fact that draws many American students into foreign universities when compared to our five-digit price tags.Campus life is definitively more pronounced within the American college experience than anywhere else in the world. While most schools abroad do have a centralized campus, America wins when it comes to vibrant campus culture.Looking at UW specifically, a lot of the experience for students comes from simply being on campus with everything it offers — game days at Camp Randall Stadium, student org fairs at the Kohl Center and student-exclusive events ranging from ice skating to art class. There is a reason why American state schools are so well known for their school pride and bustling campus energy.Pros and cons of the American college systemLet’s begin with the pros. To start, a U.S. bachelor’s degree is highly sought after and is generally well-respected both in America and abroad when you enter the job market. For example, UW is ranked 31st in Shanghai Ranking’s assessment of world universities and 41st by US News. U.S. universities consistently rank highly or at the top of these lists.We also have a larger array of major options to choose from. Often, international schools will offer a handful of academic pathways that are more general but UW offers over 125 separate majors and certificates.UW campus shows signs that vaccinations are best in fight against COVID-19
After a year and a half of mostly online classes, University of Wisconsin administrators worried about how in-person classes would Read…The general education requirements in America also give students more time to decide exactly what degree they want to pursue. Vibrant campus life also makes it easier to feel connected to your school and fellow undergrads, allowing students to build life-long relationships.So college in the U.S. is a nice stepping stone between high school and full adulthood — and the resources available to you as an American college student are not accessible anywhere else in the world.Looking at the cons, it won’t be surprising that the first one to come to mind is the cost.American tuition rates are insanely high compared to the low cost or free education students get at universities elsewhere in the world. Even in-state level tuition at UW is a whopping ten grand per year, without even considering textbooks, housing, transportation and other personal expenses. Out-of-state tuition is even harder to bear financially.To make matters worse, it’s also harder to obtain financial aid and scholarships in the U.S. because of how competitive the market has become.One of America’s strongest assets is also one of its downsides — the diversity of our universities. Degree requirements and major options look different in every state — without even taking into consideration private institutions. For example, a UW student is getting a much different education than someone studying at a private liberal arts college on the East Coast.What needs to change and howSo how do we improve our higher education system? Well, the number one priority should be making them more financially accessible.There is a reason why the national percentage of American students who choose to go to college abroad is rising every year — it’s because it’s more financially feasible than college in the U.S., even when lower in-state tuition options are considered.UW expands sexual assault services to UHS, campus rape culture persists

Every state offers a different ratio of general education requirements, majors and courses — and that isn’t even accounting for private colleges.Though the diversity of American education is one of its strongest assets, it would be helpful to have a baseline standard every university needs to meet.Fiona Hatch (fhatch@wisc.edu) is a freshman studying political science and international studies.",US universities come up short in comparison to international institutions,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2018/03/09/uw-surgeons-history-of-sexual-misconduct-reprehensible-but-accepting-responsibility-crucial-first-step/,"Mar 9, 2018","On March 7, The Badger Herald published an article exploring the past of University of Wisconsin plastic surgeon John Siebert.UW Health hired Siebert in 2011 after he moved to Wisconsin from New York. During his medical practice in New York, he engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with a female patient, resulting in a three-year suspension of his medical license. Siebert’s license was reinstated under the provision that he must have a chaperone in the room anytime he sees a female patient.UW hired Siebert while he was still under New York State Board of Professional Medical Conduct’s investigation for “professional misconduct” and “moral unfitness to practice.” But UW determined that despite his transgressions, Siebert’s medical record was impressive and, according to Wisconsin officials, Siebert was “not seriously harmful to the public.”UW spokeswoman Lisa Brunette said Siebert was hired because he is “one of the most gifted surgeons in the nation, perhaps the world.”Whether Siebert deserved to be hired at all given his history of sexual misconduct is a question that deserves to be addressed, but his conduct in the workplace since being hired has been in line with making amends to his actions.Importantly, Siebert himself has personally demonstrated a commitment to remediating his actions. As indicated in the aforementioned Herald article, Siebert has made no attempt to hide his transgressions in New York. On the contrary, he has been very up front.During his tenure in Wisconsin, Siebert has complied with the requirement of having a chaperone when attending to a female patient. Since moving to Wisconsin, Siebert has made no attempt to hide his past and instead, has recommitted to helping patients, accepting whatever provisions requested of him.UW takes action on sexual assault through added staff, increased training
One in four women at the University of Wisconsin have reported being sexually assaulted, according to the 2015 survey by Read…Siebert’s actions in 2006 were, and are, reprehensible. In engaging in the inappropriate behavior, he disrespected and disgraced the American Medical Association and exemplified potentially the worst behavior a doctor can. Instead of healing his patients, he directly caused harm.But Siebert’s commitment to be transparent and make amends demonstrates progress. While UW overlooking his deeds because of medical talent is highly problematic, his personal response to his misaction in 2006 is commendable and shows he is doing all we want any man who has committed such actions to do — improve.In Nov. 2017, several women accused former Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, of sexual misconduct. Following the accusations, Franken issued an apology and later resigned his Senate seat. Within his apology, Franken acknowledged, “I don’t know what was in my head when I took that picture, and it doesn’t matter. There’s no excuse…It isn’t funny. It’s completely inappropriate.”Franken’s actions, like Siebert’s, were completely deplorable and inexcusable. But also like Siebert, Franken took the best possible steps to rectify the actions.Their responses to these situations indicate something is working. Toxic men and sexual predators are realizing the errors in their ways and while no one can change the past, it is commendable that these men have taken every step possible to correct their past mistakes.But we’re not quite done.MSU’s mishandling of Nassar sexual assault shows institutional complacency, disregard for victims

But the resignation did not come without significant public pressure and a heavy-handed request from the U.S. Olympic Committee.Clearly, not all sexual predators and enablers will go without a fight. But ensuring we hold these people accountable for their actions will go a long way in changing the culture around addressing sexual predators. Franken and Siebert have shown if we commit to unequivocally and unwaveringly holding predators accountable for their actions, eventually predators will begin to hold themselves accountable for their own past actions. Only then can we expect these actions to stop.No one should support Franken, Siebert or USAG for the actions that led to mistreatment of women under their control. But the steps they have taken to correct their actions show that protests, media coverage and activism are working.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2019/04/23/sexual-assault-survivor-advocates-for-campus-carry-encourages-healing-process-for-fellow-survivors/,"Apr 23, 2019","The University of Wisconsin-Madison chapter of the Clare Boothe Luce Center for Conservative Women hosted a talk on “Living after Surviving” by Amanda Collins Johnson Tuesday evening.While attending the University of Nevada-Reno, Johnson —  founder of Teaching and Empowering Assault Rape Survivors Speak — was raped at gunpoint by a stranger. Johnson spoke about her own healing process — how she went from just surviving the traumatic event to actually living again.“I didn’t know him,” Johnson said. “But suddenly his face was so ingrained in my memory and I knew that I would never be able to pray it away … In that moment … my spiritual pulse flatlined. I survived, but it didn’t make me stronger … What good was surviving if I was no longer living.”Johnson said her recovery can be attributed to her metaphorical backbone, wishbone, funny bone and rib cage.Johnson’s “backbone” — which she defined as something that gets you out of bed in the morning, something larger than yourself — is her faith. Her “funnybone” — important because “a cheerful heart is a good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones” — is her ability to take advantage of opportunities to laugh. Her “ribcage” — and what kept her alive, she said — is her support system.UW denies implementation of Callisto sexual assault reporting services, students demand answers

This, she believes, could be prevented by allowing campus concealed carry.At the time of her assault, Johnson had a concealed carry permit, but because she was on a college campus, she was not allowed to use it, she said. Her experience led her to advocate for holders of concealed carry permits to carry their guns on college campuses. Johnson’s advocacy work became her “wishbone.”“I had been legislated into being a victim because the very law that was meant to ensure my safety ensured my attacker that I was going to be an unmatched victim for him,” Johnson said.Blank details initiatives to improve sexual harassment reporting, handling process

I say that because if they did, I would not have gotten the questions that I got. It would have been ‘Enough is enough, we are going to do what we can in order to ensure that our young women and men can go to school and preserve their dignity and keep their lives intact and not have to try to learn how to live after surviving unspeakable trauma.’”Former UW summer program participant sues university, alleging sexual harassment, assault

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2015/11/23/attributing-sexual-assault-at-concerts-to-victims-behavior-is-to-diminish-their-equal-opportunity/,"Nov 23, 2015","If a woman doesn’t want to be sexually assaulted, don’t go to a party. Don’t walk home alone. And according to a recent national survey conducted at undergraduate campuses, don’t go to college, because at University of Wisconsin more than one in four women have been assaulted.Apparently, attending concerts is now added to the laundry list of things girls shouldn’t do in fear of sexual assault. In a recent article from The Badger Herald, “EDM’s sobriety issue: Low on musicianship, high on drugs,” the reporter criticizes the genre’s lack of musicality and social movement. More specifically, he repeatedly highlights how its superficial culture — grounded in substance abuse — inhibits experiences at concerts.“The intense amount of noise, bright lights and alcohol causes people to make rash decisions,” the article said. “It is the trend to dress in revealing clothes and that, in addition to the overwhelming sensations, is a recipe for unwanted sexual contact.”This is an extremely troubling statement. While its implication of rampant sexual assault at concerts is accurate, the article’s overall assessment of the issue is disturbing and false.The article accurately notes the “defined rape problem” at concerts. The linked Vice article illustrates several first-hand accounts of rape at music festivals and concerts in the UK, including one instance in which a woman was grabbed by three men and dragged to a toilet.A year before Vice’s exposé, Fox News reported, “While there is no agency that collects data about sexual assaults at concert venues and festivals, industry experts and law enforcement officials we talked to say that sexual assaults at these events are on the rise.”This assessment was also immersed within an inexhaustive string of recent offenses, including a man allegedly raping a 17-year-old girl on a lawn at a Keith Urban concert in broad daylight, while onlookers did nothing.These statistics and individual horror stories are not merely shocking headlines or an intangible epidemic contained behind closed doors. They reflect the physical and psychological ramifications of blaming sexual assault on its victims, rather than its perpetrators and passive bystanders.Rape culture describes a society in which women are blamed for their own assault, and by extension, their own apparent insubordination, such as wearing too little or drinking too much. For example, the Badger Herald article notes that a “trend to dress in revealing clothes” and “overwhelming sensations” are a “recipe for unwanted sexual contact.”This attribution of rape to scanty dresses, drugs and music — rather than the perpetrator — is an indication of a culture that not only minimizes rape, but blames its victims.While it cannot be denied that alcohol and drugs — mixed with the “escapist” atmosphere of concerts and music festivals — may very well grant individuals with a heightened sense of freedom and entitlement to blame sexual assault on these factors is to excuse the individual who committed the crime.In turn, victims are told they are not only unwelcome in the environment where the assault took place, but they are endangered in it as well. In short, if a woman doesn’t want to be sexually assaulted, don’t go to a concert.The price of sexual assault is therefore not only the psychological and physical suffering for the victim, but the destruction of equal opportunity. When women attend a concert, they are not “asking for it.” They are exercising their rights to equally partake in culture. By demanding that they refrain from this equal participation — whether in a turtle-neck or tube top — is to take away that right.Unfortunately, this sentiment is not contained to the ambiguous, rolling crowds of rowdy concerts. Those on the other side — the musicians themselves — experience rape culture.Most recently after Ke$ha charged her producer Dr. Luke with sexual assault, her label Sony refused to allow her to record an album without him.“Ke$ha now faces an abysmal decision,” Mark Gerago, Ke$ha’s lawyer, said. “Work with her alleged abuser … or idly and passively wait as her career tick-tocks away.”The disregard of Ke$ha’s perspective and alleged experience demonstrates explicitly how rape culture can bar a woman from equally engaging in society. If she continues the fight against her alleged attacker, Ke$ha’s career is jeopardized.In regard to violence against women, including sexual violence, feminist and author Gloria Steinem said the following:“We have to imagine change before we can begin to move toward it. Then we also need to not only stand at the side of the river bend and rescue the people who are drowning, which is crucial … But some of us also need to go to the head of the river and see why people are falling in.”In light of rape culture at concerts and beyond, I hope society can learn to not only comfort and protect victims, but to properly attribute why they are attacked in the first place.",Attributing sexual assault at concerts to victims’ behavior is to diminish their equal opportunity rights,UWM

UW professor accused of sexual misconduct retires
Allegations of sexual harassment against former University of Wisconsin professor Harvey Jacobs have been substantiated, according to an investigation completed Read…Under guidelines set by former President Barack Obama, sexual harassment was defined as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.” But according to the proposal, DeVos set three categories for harassment: Unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe it denies a person equal access to an education program or activity, harassment in the workplace or classroom and sexual assault.The federal proposal called for supportive measures for the accused like course adjustments and counseling. The accused would also be allowed to cross-examine accusers during sexual misconduct hearings via a representative.UW System spokesperson Heather LaRoi issued a statement in response to DeVos’ proposal and said the UW System will review her announcement with their existing Title IX task force to fully examine the implications of the proposed changes.In the statement, LaRoi said the UW System is committed to upholding practices and policies that prevents sexual harassment and violence.Madison’s Rape Crisis Center also released a statement Friday that immediately opposed changes to the Title IX law.“These new rules will negatively affect survivors, making it even more difficult than it already is to prove sexual assault — while at the same time giving new rights to perpetrators,” the RCC statement said. “With all the growth our country is continuing to achieve to stop sexual assault and harassment from growing, this is particularly offensive to us at the Rape Crisis Center.According to the RCC, the proposed changes would make it harder to prove sexual misconduct allegations.If the victim returns to school, for example, the conduct is not denying them an education — so it’s no longer considered harassment, according to the RCC statement.Campus leaders discuss changes to sexual assault policies at Diversity Forum

https://badgerherald.com/news/2021/12/08/uw-female-students-represent-future-of-stem-despite-underrepresentation/,"Dec 8, 2021","There are few disciplines that change as rapidly as science. New research is conducted and published every day, and it takes just one discovery to send years of study into upheaval. Despite being such a dynamic field, science has managed to maintain a striking trend — the underrepresentation of women.According to the U.S. Census, in 1970 women held only 8% of the science, technology, engineering and math — or STEM — careers in the U.S. In 2019, the numbers rose to depict women being almost half of the workforce but still holding only 27% of the available STEM jobs, showing progress but also a prevailing disparity.For women of color, representation is incredibly lacking. As of 2017, Black women only made up 2% of the STEM workforce, according to the National Science Foundation. Asian women made up 5%, and Hispanic women also represented 2% of STEM workers.Lack of access to STEM careers also means lack of access to some of the highest paying jobs available. On a list of 20 occupations with the highest median salaries from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 17 were in STEM fields including medicine, engineering, and computer sciences.As a computer science major, UW junior Carla Rose said she has felt these disparities in her classrooms.“Looking around my class I am the only person of color, the only Black woman,” Rose said. “I feel like there’s definitely a lack of support for students like me and I think that has become very deterring.”In her time at UW, Rose has worked to create spaces and community for students of color within computer science. During the pandemic, Rose implemented the Multicultural Computer Science Study Table, which provides tutoring and drop-in hours.Skipping sleep to study for finals comes at a cost, UW researchers say
Sleepiness feels like a constant in many college student’s daily life with missed classes and midday naps. This plague peaks Read…Rose also brought ColorStack, a national organization with the goal of providing community to computer science students of color, to UW.“The [computer science] department was really supportive of trying to create an organization for that community. What I did was have to look at different national orgs that had that same mission and same community already started,” Rose said. “I was able to connect with the ColorStack national organization and now this year we’re able to get everything started to be a registered student org.”Rose said feelings of inferiority have been a challenge throughout her academic career, however creating her own spaces for community and support along with working with professors and faculty to address the lack of support for students of color has helped her to navigate this.In an email statement to The Badger Herald, UW spokesperson Meredith McGlone said the Computer Science department offers programs such as the Wisconsin Emerging Scholars–CS, which provides support for historically marginalized students and those who are new to programming.In addition, the Wisconsin Science and Computing Emerging Research Stars is a new mentorship program started by CS faculty members to foster research participation among undergraduate students, with a particular focus on students from historically underrepresented groups, according to McGlone.“We value the work of students who are engaged in the creation of spaces where they can build community, and we strive to support these efforts through advising support and financial resources,” McGlone said.Through her research in paleontology, UW junior and genetics major Shailaja Singh has experienced working in a white male-dominated field.“Fields like paleontology, anthropology and archaeology do have their history intertwined with colonialism and white supremacy. And you can’t really separate yourself from that history, it’s important to acknowledge it,” Singh said.Singh currently works in a geology lab prepping fossils for further study and has been fascinated with paleontology since she first picked up a dinosaur book as a toddler.The Lab Report: Anantharaman Microbiome Lab digs into Lake Mendota’s bacteria

It just shows we’re all connected.” Singh said. “Through paleontology we can learn a lot about our climate, where our species came from, and life in general.”Despite a love for the field, Singh noted the lack of women present. One example is that for on-site digs, most universities do not have a sexual harassment policy in place. Singh said so few women participate in these trips that institutions don’t feel the need to address possible risks.Despite working on three different research projects, Singh has only had one female PI, a fact she said she is very aware of. Discussions with this PI included recollections of sexual harassment and crude remarks that used to be the norm for female scientists. At least times have changed enough that in theory, an institution would do something about those behaviors today, Singh said.In fields that lack representation for women and especially women of color, both Rose and Singh are heavily involved in impressive work.UW research suggests more complicated link between plankton, clouds than originally thought

https://badgerherald.com/news/2011/12/07/alcohol-culture-fost/,"Dec 7, 2011","UHS Violence Prevention staff members Shira Phelps and Carmen Hotvedt said the attitude toward sexual assault victims and crimes on campus needs to change to decrease its prevalence.[/media-credit]Well before taking their first steps onto a college campus, the majority of women have at some point heard the statistic that one in every four females will be the victim of rape or attempted rape during their college years.Members of the University of Wisconsin community working to combat sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking on campus say the issue is as prevalent as ever at UW and remains an equally dominant concern at other Big 10 universities.Alcohol as a drugFrom a young age, women are taught to “watch their drinks” and not seriously socialize with individuals they do not know well. But, what many women on college campuses fail to realize, Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment spokesperson Jacqueline O’Reilly said, is that alcohol is the number one drug behind rape.“Often times, students disclose to us and it’s a very similar story often involving alcohol,” O’Reilly said. “If you listen to the language students are using, alcohol is seen as the gateway to consent, but if anything, it inhibits the ability to consent.”Many of the cases brought to PAVE, O’Reilly said, involve students drinking at a party and being coerced into a situation they are not comfortable with, despite the fact that the circumstances may look different from the outside.As a result of the key role alcohol plays in sexual assault incidents on college campuses, victims are often blamed for the assault, Shira Phelps, University Health Services Violence Against Women Prevention Coordinator, said.Situations often arise, Phelps said, where the perpetrator will argue the charges are questionable because both parties were under the influence.“The excuse that gets jumbled is ‘I was drunk, too, so technically didn’t we rape each other?'” Phelps said. “You don’t get off for killing someone when you’re drunk, so why would you get away for sexual assault when drunk? Alcohol does not make it okay.”Because of the heavy drinking culture in Madison, alcohol’s role in sexual assault is especially prevalent on the UW campus, Carmen Hotvedt, UHS Violence Prevention Specialist, said.A study conducted during the spring 2010 semester showed UW was on par with other Big 10 campuses in regard to sexual assault prevalence.Still, Hotvedt said, UW has to consider the potential for greater problems on campus in light of the study’s showings.“There’s no indication that sexual assault at UW is any worse or better than at any other Big 10 campus, but we also know that we have a very high-risk drinking issue here,” Hotvedt said. “And, because most sexual assaults on campuses peer-to-peer happens when alcohol is in use, that might give us some different information [from the study].”The reality on the UW campusAccording to the 2009 UW System Sexual Assault Report, the UW campus led the other universities in the System for sexual assaults reported both on and off-campus.The System saw a total of 170 reported sexual assaults at its 13 campuses with UW hosting 45 of the assaults, more than a fourth of all reported attacks, according to the report. Of those attacks, 13 occurred on campus with 32 taking place off-campus.Madison Police Department spokesperson Joel DeSpain said statistically, sexual assaults on campus and in Madison went up over the last year, but Kelly Anderson, Director of the Madison Rape Crisis Center, said the spike could just be a reflection of an increase in students reporting.DeSpain said students rarely bring cases forward involving strangers, but when those incidents are reported, they are taken very seriously because the greater community is put at risk.UW saw a spike in stranger assaults against women this past summer when a string of unsolved attacks on University Avenue left the campus on alert, DeSpain said.While alcohol is involved in a number of sexual assault cases on campuses nationwide, O’Reilly said 90 percent of college assaults are committed by an acquaintance.According to the UW System report, 28 of the 45 assaults on the UW campus were committed by acquaintances; nine had perpetrators who were non-acquaintances. In eight of the reports, it was unknown whether the offender was an acquaintance.Still, O’Reilly said only five percent of college-aged sexual assault victims disclose to police or any type of authoritative body, so when a university releases statistics on sexual assaults, she said the numbers are often inaccurate.“Those numbers aren’t an accurate representation of what’s going on throughout campus because of how intolerant people can be to victims disclosing,” O’Reilly said. “We don’t really have numbers to measure its occurrence.”While Anderson said the numbers reported likely do not reflect the reality of sexual assault on campus, she said she believes UW legitimately reports the number of assaults disclosed to the university.Anderson said it is important for students to recognize the numbers still reflect an incomplete picture because of underreporting.Despite federal requirements to track and report assaults on campus, Anderson said prospective students and parents at other universities around the country are often fed false information in an attempt to make the campuses look safer.“It’s a huge challenge for universities who are being honest and confronting this problem – that’s when you get pegged as being less safe, whereas campuses who cover it up are going to have stats that make them look better,” Anderson said. “The biggest variable between campuses is not how much sexual assault is happening, but rather how many victims feel safe reporting and getting the help they need.”When students come to PAVE members to disclose, O’Reilly said two common trends prevail: The attack is often non-violent and often comes down to the perpetrator not getting consent.During a 2009-2010 campus survey conducted by the violence prevention ward of UHS, four in five students said they were willing to get verbal consent from a partner, Hotvedt said.“We need to start looking at what about that one in five is going to make them think they have consent,” Hotvedt said. “They can see their partner is clearly drunk, but they cannot identify those other warning factors for someone being incapacitated.”Getting justice: Not an easy taskWhile only five percent of college students are reporting sexual assaults to authorities, according to Anderson, an even lower number of women eventually get justice.Anderson said the Dane County District Attorney’s Office, where assaults reported to UWPD or MPD would be prosecuted, is currently understaffed, resulting in an increase in plea bargains and some cases being entirely dropped, even when the DA is confident in the case.Cases often never see a jury trial, Anderson said, because of the societal norms associated with sexual assault and the consequent negative jury response.Anderson pointed to a recent allegation being dropped against Ald. Brian Solomon, District 10, despite the DA’s remarks that she was confident Solomon had sexually assaulted a city clerk.“It’s very hard to put the victim through a jury trial when you’re sure you won’t get a conviction even when you know the law was broken,” Anderson said. “Nationally speaking, only about 10 percent of victims who report end up seeing their perpetrators serving a day incarcerated.”",Alcohol culture fosters sexual assault environment on campus,UWM

The plan also expands victim advocacy services, providing one-on-one support to ensure that students are aware of their rights and can remain in school, heal and recover, Van Orman said.The proposed budget, however, would increase the student health fee per semester from $167.28 to $212.26, UHS predicted.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2019/10/01/steering-clear-of-the-cliff/,"Oct 1, 2019","A quick stroll through the Student Activity Center will reveal they’ve done some redecorating. Whereas the construction of the new Nicholas Recreation Center across the street will create a space for students to improve their physical fitness, the new posters hanging in the SAC focus on augmenting emotional and relationship health.“Let’s start the convo,” the posters read. Accompanying the slogan are colorful hearts reminiscent of Valentine’s Day candies inscribed with phrases like “May I…?” “Is this ok?” and “Rspct my no.”The signage is part of Consent Hearts, a recent campaign from the Gender and Sexuality Campus Center aimed at promoting affirmative consent on campus. The campaign webpage leads to more resources on consent, one of which is a handout from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center on how to ensure consent in an intimate situation.“Always ask for consent before you begin any sexual activity, including kissing, cuddling, and any kind of sex — even if your partner consented in the past,” the handout reads.The 2017 University of Wisconsin Parent Handbook for Talking with College Students About Alcohol sings to a similar tune. It encourages parents to start the conversation about alcohol and consent before their children get to campus and to emphasize to them that consent “must be asked for and received” before any sexual activity occurs.UW law professor Cecelia Klingele said she has noticed a nationwide trend of campuses pushing for affirmative consent, usually alongside an element of verbalization — using words to ask for consent. Some states have already passed or proposed affirmative consent laws, which, according to the Affirmative Consent Project, take existing legislation a step further by requiring anyone who initiates intimacy to receive a verbal “yes” from the other person before making sexual contact, followed by ongoing consent throughout the encounter.In Wisconsin and many other states, the law does not require such a degree of affirmation.Nonetheless, Klingele said it is not uncommon for universities to provide students with definitions of consent that may far surpass legal standards.“There’s a reason that, usually, those education efforts are defining consent in a way that is much more structured and rigorous than the law itself would demand,” Klingele said. “The idea is that … we’re trying to encourage people not to walk at the edge of the cliff, but rather only to engage in sexual conduct with each other when it’s clear and obvious that there is consent — not when there might or might not be.”Between mandatory first-year prevention programs, University Health Services resources and other university-affiliated efforts, UW repeatedly provides lessons on consent, alcohol and sexual assault. The way the language of these messages differ from that of the actual law, though, can impact students in a variety of ways.State sexual assault legislation is found under Wisconsin Statutes 940.225, where the legal definition of consent also resides.Unlike the Consent Hearts campaign and the Parent Handbook, the legislature declares consent to be verbal or nonverbal actions, but they must still indicate a freely-given agreement to engage in sexual activity. People who are unconscious or otherwise unable to physically communicate unwillingness are presumed incapable of consenting — it must be given by someone “competent to give informed consent.”According to the statute, a person can be incapable of consenting if they are intoxicated by drugs or alcohol to a certain degree. Anyone who has sexual contact or intercourse with someone who reaches this level of intoxication which “renders that person incapable of giving consent” is purportedly guilty of second-degree sexual assault — a Class C felony.But wait, there’s a caveat.State law stipulates an individual is culpable of this crime when the aforementioned applies and if two addendums hold true as well:Under Chapter UWS 17 of the Wisconsin legislature, UW uses this exact statute in determining if a student has violated university policy prohibiting sexual assault. Aside from the substitution of ‘respondent’ for ‘defendant,’ the wording is identical.Lauren Hasselbacher, campus Title IX Coordinator, said before formal sexual misconduct investigations begin, her office provides and explains this and other relevant policy language to the involved parties.“That can be more technical and a bit more complex than maybe how we speak about it in our everyday language, and for that reason … we’ll discuss [the policy language] with them to explain what that means,” Hasselbacher said.Outside of UW investigations, students may not learn the legal meanings of terms related to sexual misconduct, since — as Hasselbacher noted — day-to-day discussion of this topic tends to use more casual wording.But Molly Zemke, UHS Violence Prevention Manager, stressed the importance of providing Badgers with an understanding of the legal definition of consent, something Zemke said UHS does in all of its programming.According to evaluation data in an email sent to The Badger Herald by Hasselbacher, after completing the U Got This! violence prevention and policy disclosure program, more than 95% of incoming UW students were able to correctly identify sexual assault as any sexual contact occurring without consent. In contrast, the 2016 UW-Madison Sexual Assault Climate Survey Task Force Report revealed only 32% of female undergraduates felt “very or extremely” knowledgeable about how the university defines sexual assault and misconduct.This disparity begs the question: what do UW students actually take away from consent lessons and prevention programs?The ‘Sexual Violence’ section of the UHS website displays a definition of sexual assault similar to what appears in the law books, except for two key differences.First, the section of Wisconsin sexual assault laws stating the offender must have had both knowledge of the person’s incapacity to consent and intent to still engage in sexual contact does not appear within the UHS definition.Second, instead of circuitously referring to the level of drunkenness at which someone can no longer consent as “a degree which renders that person incapable of giving consent,” UHS introduces the term “incapacitation.” In the university’s official policy language, incapacitation is defined as, “the state of being unable to physically and/or mentally make informed rational judgments and effectively communicate,” which is why consent given by someone in this condition is considered invalid.Though providing a name for the point at which drunk people can no longer consent may be preferable to how it is described by the legislature, attempting to label an objective threshold of drunkenness presents problems of its own, according to a national advocacy organization toolkit on campus sexual assault and alcohol.In response to the reportedly frequently-asked question of how much alcohol someone needs to drink to be considered incapacitated, prevention specialists could not provide a clear-cut answer.“Incapacitation can be a tricky term, as it is used in both law and policy but is rarely defined in ways that students can apply to their sexual encounters,” the toolkit reads. “Everyone’s body reacts to alcohol differently depending on body size, food eaten that day, other drugs ingested and other factors.”According to the report, even prevention specialists were unsure of how to distinguish when an intoxicated person becomes incapacitated, especially because everyone reacts to alcohol differently.Katherine Loving, UW Healthy Campus Manager, said this type of uncertainty among students is one thing alcohol education programs like AlcoholEdu and Badger Step Up! aim to mitigate.“There are many factors that go into determining how alcohol impacts an individual, but that’s partly what we’re trying to educate students about, is what that might look like,” Loving said.Zemke said some indicators of incapacitation included in prevention programs are unconsciousness, trouble walking straight or slurred speech.Peter Grimyser, a UWPD detective of almost 20 years, added vomiting, odor of alcohol, combativeness and emotional instability to the list. But, some people may get extremely drunk without manifesting the typical signs, in which case Grimyser said caution is the best option.“If you aren’t sure if someone is sober enough to consent, play it safe and don’t engage in any sexual activity,” Grimyser said in an email to The Badger Herald.Harry Quick, a UW freshman, expressed a similar outlook on how to handle uncertain situations involving the intersection of alcohol and sex. Though in explaining why he would not romantically pursue someone who may be too drunk to consent, he identified many of the same warning signs present in university prevention programs, Quick said he did not learn much from U Got This!, AlcoholEdu or Our Wisconsin.Quick said people can mute or fast forward through some of the programs, which contain relatively “basic” concepts stretched over the span of a couple hours. Instead of taking the program’s lessons and applying them to his life, Quick tends to follow his moral compass in determining whether or not a sexual encounter involving alcohol would be consensual.“If I can think clearly, if I can still do calculus in my head and they can’t walk in a straight line, then it’s not good at all,” Quick said. “It’s morally wrong.”When Quick and other students analyze the risk factors in situations where consent and alcohol may meet, they are also each doing so in a unique way. Based on upbringing, culture, religion, ethnicity and countless other contributing factors, Klingele said, people develop their own understanding of appropriate sexual behavior.Hasselbacher said UHS recognizes that students each have alternate grasps on consent based on their experiences before and during college as well.“We know people are coming in with different backgrounds, different understandings, and that can come in part from our campus trainings … and so that’s why within the particular context of an investigation, we want to be clear about what we’re doing and what we’re investigating,” Hasselbacher said. “Our prevention services are coming from a different perspective because they’re talking about how to improve campus climate, improve relationships, improve communications across the board, regardless of if something may or may not be a specific policy violation.”Without a common understanding of consent and permissible sexual behavior, Klingele said it is very likely that people will misinterpret one another’s cues. This, Klingele believes, is one reason why, similar to the Consent Hearts campaign, universities encourage explicit verbalized communication between sexual partners — to prevent instances where non-consent is mistaken for consent and to avoid the harm that can result.When alcohol is added to the mix, Klingele said, this only further complicates the situation by impairing a person’s ability to perceive their sexual partner’s feelings.Realistically, Klingele said, drunken sexual encounters still occur frequently at UW.“How many people on this campus in a weekend get so wasted that they can’t really communicate very effectively much of anything … ?” Klingele said. “And how many of those people engage in sex? Probably not an insubstantial number, unfortunately.”Klingele surmised that the next day, students probably don’t refer to state statutes in determining what happened the night before. Instead, they likely interpret the events through the same internal belief system surrounding sex that Hasselbacher said differs from person to person.Some students may technically reach the standard for sexual assault by incapacitation but feel okay about the previous night’s encounter, Klingele said. Other students, she added, may also be considered victims under the statute, and may also feel victimized.Klingele emphasized the importance of acknowledging how sexual assault laws interplay with the variety of individual perceptions of consent in the U.S. Lessons from family members, school and the university all contribute to what individuals consider acceptable sex practices to look like, Klingele said.“When there is a mismatch between their expectations [of consent] and what they experience, that’s when people are hurt, and in some of those cases, they are hurt in ways that the criminal law can do something about,” Klingele said. “Unfortunately, in a large percentage of cases, they may be hurt and there may not be much the criminal law can do to address it.”Klingele said it is important to remember that even though students may colloquially consider certain behaviors to be immoral or problematic, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are illegal. On the flipside, Klingele also said the fact that a case may not end in a conviction does not mean a crime was not committed.Judging by recent statistics, this holds true.According to the UW-Madison Sexual Assault Reports Snapshot, UW received 318 total reports of sexual assault in 2017. Of those, only 23 cases involved a respondent identified as a UW student. Twelve of the 23 complainants ultimately chose not to go forward with the disciplinary process.Of the 11 remaining cases that resulted in an investigation, UW determined the respondent to be responsible in five of them.This not to say no harm was done in the other six cases, or in the ones that never made it to the investigation process — the complainant was perhaps just unable to meet the burden of proof for UW policy standards.Almost all campus messages to students about consent refer to sexual assault as being any sexual interaction lacking consent, or where one party is inebriated beyond the point of being able to consent. Except in official UW policy, the university tends to leave out the part about needing to prove the offender intentionally pursued sexual contact with someone they knew to be incapacitated.When asked what should be done when university consent lessons do not translate exactly to real life, Klingele suggested teaching students more about how America handles crime. That way, they can at least be aware of the legal realities that lay below the precipice.“I think people have to be better educated about what the criminal justice system does and doesn’t do, and fundamentally, it doesn’t redress all wrongs that happen,” Klingele said. “Many ways in which people harm each other aren’t going to be punished by the criminal law, and when universities give students definitions of consent that go well beyond what would be required under a law, the idea is that we keep you far away from the edge of the cliff.”",Steering clear of the cliff: UW strives to educate students on ‘clear and obvious’ consent despite limited legal language,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2016/04/21/what-its-like-to-report-on-sexual-violence-against-women-as-a-female-journalist/,"Apr 21, 2016","“Man with knife,” the WiscAlert email subject line read.Before I even finished reading the email, I said to the campus beat editor, “Call UWPD now.”I then turned to the remaining three women — a photographer, a news editor and a copy editor — working in The Badger Herald office and said, “None of you are walking home on your own tonight. I’ll pay for your cab. Don’t walk alone.”“WiscAlert – 2 reports of man in black long sleeve shirt, red & white sneakers, muscular build grabbing women on campus. Last seen running towards Memorial Union,” a screenshotted text alert from my roommate read.“Be careful!” She wrote.I wish I could say this was the first time this same course of action has happened in our office.I was informed of a recent case of assault on April 8 at Memorial Union involving three alleged assailants in a way many of you probably did not. I learned of it while editing the article one of our associate editors wrote about it.Sexual assault reported near Memorial Union
A first-degree sexual assault occurred Friday night between 10:00 p.m. and 10:40 p.m. near Memorial Union.  A woman was held down by Read…It got me thinking — not for the first time — how many stories like this have I written, edited or read.Following the April 8 incident, I texted former and current editors I’ve worked with.“I’ve been thinking … there hasn’t been one month on campus since I started working [here] that we haven’t written about sexual assault. Does that sound right?” I wrote.So I checked. I started my tenure as campus news editor covering the University of Wisconsin campus at the beginning of March 2014. I looked for coverage of any incident report of sexual assault, any campus initiative to combat sexual assault or any university investigation regarding the handling of sexual assault.The results: We’ve written at least one story, if not more, about sexual assault every month since I started working for The Badger Herald.After coming to that realization, I reflected on how this has affected my feeling of safety as a woman and my perspective on sexual assaults as a reporter. Step in my shoes as I walk with you on this difficult trip down memory lane.As a reporter, my immediate reaction to learning of sexual assault … is to call a UWPD spokesperson. … As a woman, my immediate reaction is fear.In the same month I started covering campus, the U.S. Department of Education began enforcing the Campus SaVE Act, which was amended to the Clery Act a year earlier. The amendment requires all postsecondary institutions to report “a broader range” of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking to the campus community.This means campus-wide crime warnings ending with, “You are receiving this Crime Warning as part of UW-Madison’s commitment to providing campus-area crime information, in compliance with the federal Clery Act,” were increasingly showing up in student inboxes in order for UWPD to comply with the federal mandate.As a reporter, my immediate reaction to learning of sexual assault from an email like that or an incident report is to call a UWPD spokesperson to discuss details of what happened. “Was the victim a student? How old? Did the victim know the suspect? Did it happen on campus grounds or in a residence hall?” These are lines I’ve recited many times.As a woman, my immediate reaction is fear.Suffocating my fear in order to report the news is a skill I’m mostly numb to now, but it wasn’t always that way.When I became news editor the following semester in fall 2014, there were three instances of sexual assaults committed by a stranger… all within a few blocks of where I had just moved in mere days before.Pay attention to the sequence of these reports.That was my introduction to the role. For the rest of the year, I would be walking a mile from The Badger Herald office to my building usually well past midnight.I was terrified. I cried. I wanted to call my mom. I didn’t call my mom. I called UWPD.I had to write an article. In every call I made to UWPD, I was met with the same refrain: Stranger assaults are rare.For a longer story I wrote about those stranger assaults, I called the Dane County Rape Crisis Center. The center’s director said 80 to 85 percent of perpetrators target people they know. The idea that all rapists are strangers in a dark alley is a false stigma.Stranger sexual assaults rise as students return to Madison
Three sexual assaults committed by strangers were reported in the same week only days after students began returning to their Read…This did little to soften my fear. The only thing that could help was time. Time until I’ve walked myself home without incident multiple days in a row. Enough time to remind myself this fear was justified, but wasn’t based in reason. Time spent telling myself that the number of women who get home safe is much higher than the number that don’t.But time could only soothe me until the next Timely Warning popped up in my inbox or I came across a new police incident report. That time frame can range from a day to week or longer, but sometimes multiple assaults occur in shorter windows.Like a weekend in April 2015 when three assaults were reported. One was in Memorial Library, two were in dorms. One was an acquaintance assault.Three sexual assaults reported to UWPD over the weekend

You go to the library to study; it’s an assumption that you’ll feel safe. Your safety in a library shouldn’t be a question. A dorm is a student’s first home on campus. It’s where you meet your first friends. Your safety in a dorm with friends shouldn’t be a question. The fear came and went once again.Then in fall 2015 when I started my year as The Badger Herald managing editor, an Association of American Universities study revealed 27.6 percent of female undergraduates on campus reported having experienced sexual assault on campus.Report: More than one in four women sexually assaulted at UW
University of Wisconsin released data Monday, Sept. 21, showing nearly 28 percent of undergraduate females reported experiencing sexual assault involving force or Read…It was in editing that story that I looked around our office — our majority female office — and I felt a responsibility as a leader in our organization to do something. I felt it was my duty. I somehow felt accountable. But what could I do?About a month ago during this current spring semester, I edited an article about a woman who was choked on State Street in the middle of the day at 3:45 p.m.Police break up ugly fight on State Street

It’s not going to protect one of my colleagues who goes home with someone they falsely believe they can trust. It’s not going to protect someone if it’s left in their purse while they study in the library. It’s not going to protect them while they’re asleep in their bed if someone breaks in.After all the time over the past two years reading, reporting and editing articles about sexual assault, I’m educated enough to know change doesn’t start with a keychain, it starts with a conversation.So let’s talk.***Editor’s note: Our production cycle aligns with the academic calendar from late August to early December and then again from late January to early May. Incidents occurring in months falling outside of that time frames may be unaccounted for.I begin my time as campus associate editor in March.Police arrest 6 in connection with sexual assault and home invasion

https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2015/09/23/uwpds-dont-be-that-guy-slogan-is-all-wrong/,"Sep 23, 2015","University of Wisconsin Police Department’s latest campaign against sexual assault leaves the male student population chewing on the provocative, but elegantly-simple motto, “Don’t Be That Guy.”A couple days before classes started, I was on the bus and found myself surrounded by UWPD’s new slogan posted on multiple signs around the bus.“Don’t Be That Guy:” cool, fresh, hip, new-aged, cultured and something all of us young, intellectual college students can really relate to.Nope. Until I see members of UWPD walking around wearing salmon shorts and ending every statement with “bro,” this slogan won’t really do much for me.By no means do I ever aspire to be that so-called guy, but this campaign just seems like another clichéd attempt for the older generation to connect to the younger one.It’s just like when parents try to pick up on their kids’ lingo and use it in conversation with them. It comes off as tacky.I get what UWPD is trying to do. I have to admit some of the posters are rather powerful, but I honestly do not think flooding the campus with the words “Don’t Be That Guy” is the best way to prevent sexual assault.First of all, these posters quite literally alienate the entire male half of the population.Sure, it’s true a vast majority of sexual assault cases include women as the victims, but we shouldn’t speak in social absolutes on an equality-striving campus notorious for amplifying the voice of the minority.That’s a bold move to say the least. “That Guy.” Who is “That Guy”? The stereotypical frat-star douche who’s been sipping a glass of water at a party, claiming it’s Grey Goose, and hitting on very inebriated girls who can barely stand, let alone give consent.This motto kind of puts anyone with the XY chromosome on the same level as that frat-star douche.Apparently they get we’re guys, but they’re asking us not to be “That Guy,” whatever that means. How about “Don’t Be That Person”?It doesn’t flow off the tongue as smoothly, but it’s definitely not the worst alternative.Further, I can understand the utilization of a common phrase to get a point across, but I don’t know if “Don’t Be That Guy” is a good one to associate with an issue as serious as sexual assault.There are many instances where being “That Guy” is something as insignificant as bumping into the beer-pong table at a party. I’m no expert, but putting sexual assault on a similar level as the average party foul is probably not the best idea.What really sets me off is UWPD thought this slogan was so clever they decided to make it this year’s battle cry against sexual assault.What happened to the “Badgers Get Consent” slogan? That called for unity amongst all Badgers against the social issue that is sexual assault. There’s no alienation of one gender and no tacky, cliché saying. That is something I can get behind.But like I said, I understand what UWPD is trying to do and I can appreciate it. I just don’t think “Don’t Be That Guy” is the right choice as the battle cry against sexual assault.I do, however, think the theme of the posters has its time and place, but as the main slogan of a campaign striving for social respect, it leaves a lot to be desired.Phil Michaelson (pmichaelson@wisc.edu) is majoring in biomedical engineering.",UWPD’s ‘Don’t be that guy’ not right campaign to prevent sexual assault,UWM

https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/12/05/women-in-uw-department-of-urban-planning-grapple-with-legacy-of-sexism-sexual-harassment/,"Dec 5, 2017","Amid the continuing national conversation regarding sexual harassment, sexism and gender prejudice in the workplace, the University of Wisconsin reaffirmed its commitment to a campus climate free of sexual harassment, assault and misconduct.This reaffirmation comes after recent scrutiny of the UW Department of Urban Planning, in which the almost entirely male faculty has divulged years of complaints from female students and staff about sexual harassment.Multiple women have reported to the Wisconsin State Journal that the professor in question is Harvey Jacobs. UW officials also believe Jacobs to be the professor which against which these accusations have been levelled.In a later email to The Badger Herald, UW spokesperson Meredith McGlone said this fall, a formal complaint has now been brought against Jacobs under Chapter 9 of Faculty Policies and Procedures. That could result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal, she added. UW takes action on sexual assault through added staff, increased training
One in four women at the University of Wisconsin have reported being sexually assaulted, according to the 2015 survey by Read…University Health services violence prevention manager Samantha Johnson said these allegations could be referring to a range of incidents, all of which involve some “unwelcome and unwanted” action.“Sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances, unwelcome sexual requests, unwelcome physical contact of a sexual nature and unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature,” Johnson said.  In a March report, the Wisconsin Student Planning Association said current and former students have felt the “strain of the sexism, lack of protection and in some cases, sexual harassment and hostile behavior” at the Dept. of Urban Planning.In a 2015 survey on sexual assault, the American Association of Universities found 53.3 percent of female graduate students reported experiencing sexual harassment during their time as a student at UW, and of those female graduate students, 22.2 percent cited that harasser was a faculty member, 10.7 percent said it was a staff member or an administrator, and another 4.8 percent said it was a person affiliated with a UW program.Among UW’s staff, the UW Title IX Coordinator Lauren Hasselbacher said there have been five discrimination investigations conducted over the past five years in which sexual harassment was alleged against a university employee.UW Chancellor Blank reaffirms UW’s commitment to Title IX protections

The report found most women feel included, although several noted that they would not feel comfortable working one-on-one with some male faculty members.Further investigation of the department’s climate was conducted by consultant Ann Zanzig, who interviewed members of the department to thoroughly evaluate their experiences.It was found that of the 20 respondents, as many as 22 percent had either experienced or witnessed some form of harassment or discrimination due to gender, race or other personal attributes.Despite changes at federal level, UW to continue upholding Title IX protections
In light of the U.S. Department of Education’s decision to rescind several Title IX federal guidelines on investigating and prosecuting Read…Following the release of the faculty review committee report, Zanzig’s report and the 2015 AAU report on seuxal assault, the need for reform has been requested by multiple groups.The faculty review committee report posited recommendations for future actions, saying that the department should work to improve the departmental climate, including mandated diversity training for all faculty.In response to the program review committee’s February 2017 report, the WSPA also came out with reform requests.“Moving forward, URPL students expect to see immediate measures to address these issues on a short and long term basis,” the student group wrote to the department in March. “Students echo the severity of this issue as identified by the Review Committee and desire immediate action by the Department that addresses the scale of the issue.”According to the report, this immediate action should include a dedication of time and resources necessary to ensure student safety.‘Me Too:’ UW survivors speak out about their experiences, paths to recovery
Editor’s note: This piece contains accounts of sexual assault. Each survivor of sexual assault is different, and each has felt Read…McGlone said the department chair has worked with faculty, staff and students to address many of the concerns expressed.This includes a variety of actions, such as conducting relevant surveys and ensuring transparent reporting of their results, ensuring the completion of sexual harassment awareness training and a commitment to diversifying departmental staff with respects to gender through the hiring of another tenured female professor, McGlone said.While the efficacy of these changes has yet to be seen, allowing these reforms to have meaningful effect will take time. Johnson said the effects of sexual assault can linger and will continue to cause problems for survivors.“The impact of harassment upon students and faculty that has already occurred will continue to manifest trauma, mental stress and PTSD-like symptoms,” Johnson said._____Update 3:10 p.m.: This article has been updated to include an updated statement from UW spokesperson Meredith McGlone.Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled the professor’s name.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2017/10/11/greek-life-feature/,"Oct 11, 2017","The sun set over Langdon as an energetic group of young men gathered in the front yard of Tau Kappa Epsilon. From afar, the dimming daylight reflecting on their matching blue shirts resembled a themed party.It was indeed a party, but not the kind with vibrating speakers or sugar-loaded alcoholic punch.“Do you guys want to come pet puppies? We take Venmo, too,” a member of the fraternity urged passing pedestrians, as another caressed a small golden dog.Members of Tau Kappa Epsilon gathered for Paws for a Cause, a puppy-petting event in its third year running. It is the first of a series of philanthropy events the fraternity hosts to raise donations for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Last year, they raised about $14,000.Tau Kappa Epsilon is not alone in its philanthropic endeavors. Ten fraternities and eight sororities affiliated with the Interfraternity Council and the Panhellenic Association raised a total of more than $300,000 for their designated charities last year.Despite high donation numbers, the campus community also sees a high prevalence of policy violations from Greek life. Of the 36 incidents reported to the Committee of Students Organizations last year, 22 involved a fraternity or sorority, said Eric Knueve, assistant dean and director of the Center for Leadership and Involvement. Headlines also tell of incidents in which Greek-letter organizations are involved with sexual assault, hazing and racial bias.Considering the various negative incidents involving the Greek community — and that there are more than 250 non-Greek, service-oriented student organizations on campus, according to the WIN Involvement Network — some students question others’ decision to participate in Greek life based on philanthropy.UW junior Emily Dynis, who will volunteer at Meriter Hospital as a pre-nursing major, said if a student wanted to volunteer or fundraise, they could choose another student organization.“A lot of times people try to justify joining Greek life for philanthropy,” Dynis said. “In reality, they can just join other student organizations for that. At the end of the day, they pick sororities or fraternities based on status and money.”More than 14 percent of UW students are affiliated with Greek Life, Knueve said. Mandatory service requirements imposed by many fraternities and sororities push about 4,000 undergraduate students to volunteer each year.“I think a lot of times things are cornered as Greek problems. But in a lot of ways, especially with heavy binge drinking, it’s just a college problem.”
Recent graduate Jake BujnowskiIts sheer size creates a productive environment in which members exchange ideas enhancing philanthropic outcomes, Michael Baer, vice president of philanthropy at IFC, said. Most leaders in IFC facilitate workshops for that purpose.“You’re going to have a mix of people, often from different backgrounds — academic, cultural, geographic backgrounds — bringing their different skill sets together to brainstorm ideas on how to raise money,” Baer said.But negative stigmas against Greek life can sometimes pose challenges.“I feel like sometimes we can be looked at in a bad light from the campus, or as an exclusive group,” Emily Rosati, philanthropy chair at the organization, said.While Greek life is often met with criticism from the larger campus community, the two often work together.One example of this is Humorology, an annual musical comedy show with a Greek-majority cast which raises money for a specific charity. Humorology is the largest student-run philanthropic organization in the state of Wisconsin and is making efforts to involve more non-Greek students, Rosati.UW Humorology strikes balance between friendship, fun, philanthropy
Ben Winding probably did not realize he would be singing and dancing in a philanthropic musical every year when he first enrolled at Read…There are four non-Greek affiliated members on its executive board this year. Together, they raised more than $195,000 for The Rainbow Project last year, Rosati said. This year, they are looking to donate $215,000 to the Neighborhood House Community Center.“When you take a step back and realize you’re part of something bigger than yourself, it’s so motivating it can drive you through the year,” Rosati said.UW HumorologyFraternity members are also strongly represented in the student organization Men Against Sexual Assault. The group focuses on educating men about sexual violence and rape culture.Two sorority members, Maddie Zimmerman and Lauren Silber, took it upon themselves to leave Langdon and connect with campus as a whole. Janie Felton, chair at the non-Greek affiliated Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment (PAVE), said Zimmerman and Silber approached her to form a partnership.This past summer, PAVE helped train select members of the Greek community to facilitate Relationship FLAGS, a workshop centered on sexual assault, dating violence and healthy relationships, Felton said. The project was one of seven to receive the 2017-18 Wisconsin Idea Fellowship grant.Even when not working in tandem, registered student organizations and the Greek community are often supporting the same efforts.Last year, PAVE advocated for consent, bystander intervention and victim support to more than 900 students via volunteering and workshops around campus, Felton said. But due to registered student organization regulations, PAVE is prohibited from fundraising.‘Finally taking action’: Greek community to implement first major plan to address sexual assault
While Greek life communities across the nation have long been criticized for higher rates of sexual assault, few comprehensive studies Read…Similarly, last year, UW’s Alpha Chi Omega chapter worked to support assault survivors by donating more than $23,000 to local crisis service agency Domestic Abuse Intervention Services, Heather Barnwell, philanthropy chair at Alpha Chi Omega, said.When a whole fraternity or sorority is focused on altruism, those values radiate through the community.Jonathan Sogin, vice president at Theta Delta Chi, emphasized the importance of role models.“Mentorship is one of the most important things that I think fraternities do for people,” Sogin said.Sarah Piñón, Greek life specialist at the UW Center for Leadership and Involvement, said the Greek system provides students with opportunities to bond over service, which reinforces a “lifelong commitment” to philanthropy.“Fundraising and uniting the local community are my deepest passions.”
Nikki NovoselskySimilarly, Jane Piliavin, UW sociology professor specializing in altruism, said when a volunteer setting involves friendships and role models, those involved can develop an identity and sense of self that is attached to altruism.“Once you’ve been bitten by the bug, it just becomes a part of who you are,” Piliavin said. “That tends to carry you through.”Nikki Novoselsky, former director at Humorology and Pi Beta Phi alumna, said in an email to The Badger Herald that her experience with the organization had been “instrumental” in her decision to continue pursuing nonprofit work.Novoselsky is now program director at Neighborhood House Community Center.“It became clear to me that fundraising and uniting the local community are my deepest passions,” Novoselsky said. “Everything has come full circle.”Social pressure and desire to belong can also prompt members to accept and take in similar values as their peers, Piliavin said.But these lingering effects of social solidarity and pressure affect not just altruistic behaviors, Piliavin added.“It doesn’t necessarily have to be charitable activity, though,” Piliavin said. “It could be going out and getting drunk, for that matter — which is unfortunately something that is also characteristic of the Greek system.”Among the 22 policy violation incidents involving IFC or PHA reported to CSO last year, 20 involved allegations of violating the Student Organization Alcohol Policy, Knueve said. Six of these reports were ultimately dismissed.The reality of alcohol use is one of the administration’s major concerns about Greek life, Knueve said. He said the Greek community should promote responsible alcohol consumption so drinking “isn’t becoming a sole focus” of these organizations. But this is also a problem for the campus as a whole, he added.While Jake Bujnowski, UW graduate and former Theta Delta Chi member, said heavy alcohol consumption and drinking games happen at frat parties, excessive drinking is not exclusive to Greek life.“I think a lot of times things are cornered as Greek problems,” Bujnowski said. “But in a lot of ways, especially with heavy binge drinking, it’s just a college problem.”Another concern about Greek life is the potential for hazing. From member experiences and incidents, it seems excessive drinking and hazing can sometimes be linked.Two years ago, the university terminated Chi Phi’s campus chapter for an incident involving both hazing and alcohol consumption. During an initiation ceremony, members made a pledge enter a casket. An intoxicated member then stomped on the head area of the casket, breaking it and causing head injuries to the student inside. The pledge was hospitalized and suffered a concussion.Records: Terminated Chi Phi fraternity put pledge in casket
Chi Phi’s once-secret initiation ceremony was the cause for the chapter’s termination, records show. A Chi Phi fraternity pledge who Read…But Bujnowski said hazing did not occur in Theta Delta Chi. As recruitment chair, then president, Bujnowski made it clear to new members that they should never be forced to do anything against their will. If new members were ever put in a situation like that, or one that made them uncomfortable, Bujnowski told them to come to him. During her time at UW, recent graduate and Kappa Kappa Gamma alumna Helen Matsumoto said she heard about incidents that could qualify as minor hazing. Matsumoto heard stories of frat members making pledges do chores or encouraging heavy drinking. But Matsumoto said she never heard of anyone being harmed by these things.Matt Grande, an active member at Chi Psi, or “The Lodge,” acknowledged some of these concerns about the Greek community. He pointed to news reports regarding hazing and excessive drinking in Greek life and agreed those issues should be addressed. He said the Greek community should promote safety, especially when it comes to alcohol.Excessive drinking, in turn, can also prime an environment for unwanted sexual behaviors — intentional or not. According to the 2015 AAU report, alcohol is present in the majority of sexual assaults.Additionally, the report found disproportionately high rates of sexual assault in UW’s Greek housing.Sexual assault reported at fraternity house
University Wisconsin Police Department issued a crime warning Sunday of a reported sexual assault that occurred earlier that morning at Read…During her sophomore year, UW senior Alyssa Scuric brought a girl home from a fraternity party because the girl felt uncomfortable with the sexual advances of a fraternity member. Scuric said the girl and the fraternity member were “both just very drunk,” something that makes consent for either party impossible.Earlier this year, UW’s chapter of Sigma Chi was suspended for serving alcohol to minors. The fraternity’s members were also singing a song about “a presumably fictional” fellow member who sexually assaulted 100 women against a wall, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.Scuric also said a stranger warned her of the “red room” at a fraternity house. It was where “guys take girls to hook up,” Scuric said.Bujnowski said social pressures within fraternities may contribute to disproportionate rates of sexual assault. This is something Bujnowski finds frustrating, as he has close female friends who are survivors.“There’s this pressure to fit in, and I think within Greek life there’s this idea that you have to be really manly and macho,” Bujnowski said. “And a big part of that is to be sexual and sexually active.”Whatever the cause, Bujnowski said he is proud to see that Greek life is working to address sexual assault. Knueve said the Greek community has, among other policies, created a sexual assault task force and changed their bylaws to address the issue.Erik Hansen, treasurer of Men Against Sexual Assault, said in an email to The Badger Herald that education and engagement on an individual level will be key to changing the culture.“We recognize much more work still has to be done in Greek life,” Hansen said. “We will continue to spark conversation and action to support Greek members in taking ownership of their community and working to change the culture.”Sigma Chi fraternity officially placed on suspension
On the first day of classes, the University of Wisconsin chapter of Sigma Chi has been officially suspended from all university Read…Excessive drinking and sexual assault aside, members are also concerned about diversity within the Greek community.Notably, UW’s Sigma Alpha Epsilon was suspended last year for enabling a “hostile, discriminatory” environment from 2014 to early 2016. A CSO report also showed slurs, jokes and derogatory language were repeatedly directed toward minority groups.Grande said it’s important to make sure Greek life isn’t full of the same guys and girls from the same backgrounds.“Diversity is not necessarily lacking, but at the same time it can be better with people coming from different background,” Grande said.Nonetheless, Knueve said the Greek community has been “very diligent” in trying to improve its culture, especially around sexual behaviors.“People in Greek life know that there are a lot of good things, and people outside of Greek life definitely see the bad things — and that turns them off to it without really seeing that there is more to it.”
Matt GrandeHe added, however, that the administration has all of these concerns for other students and organizations on campus as well. The challenge for the Greek community in particular, he said, lies in whether or not general members buy into their leader’s desire to change the culture for the better.“If you have a few people who are setting a good example and trying to be stand-up guys, it trickles down,” Sogin said. “It doesn’t happen overnight, it happens over long periods of time.”Ultimately, Knueve said the benefits — or lack thereof — of Greek life are dependent on whether individual student’s personal values align with those of their prospective Greek organization.Knueve said for students who are joining for the right reasons, Greek life can be a “tremendous opportunity” for students to establish networks and work toward common goals. But joining does come with a risk.“There are also some trappings there that could lead you to join for the wrong reasons, and maybe lose a little bit of who you are in that process,” Knueve said.For Matsumoto, membership in Kappa Kappa Gamma opened a lot of doors. While there are negatives, Matsumoto said overall, Greek life does “a lot of good for a lot of people.”Though Grande acknowledged the negative incidents involving Greek life should be addressed, he also said that “there is more” to Greek life than these incidents.“I think there is a balance in the end,” Grande said. “People in Greek life know that there are a lot of good things, and people outside of Greek life definitely see the bad things — and that turns them off to it without really seeing that there is more to it.”In the same vein, Bujnowski said he hopes people outside of the Greek community will see the positives that come with it, and understand the negatives affect the whole campus, not just Langdon.Ultimately, Landry Ndahayo, chief justice of IFC, said it will take time to see significant growth and change within the Greek community.“I do not look at it as a balancing act of enough good things to counter the bad. I look at it as every year there will be a step in the right direction,” Ndahayo said. “There will be a few bumps along the way, but that is expected when you are going through significant change.”","Night and Day: As Greek life works to serve community, counter-culture of drinking, sexual assault pervades",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2021/12/07/go-big-or-go-bankrupt-wisconsin-farmers-face-daunting-challenges-as-factory-farms-flourish/,"Dec 7, 2021","Jim Goodman had high hopes for his dairy farming business. After spending the bulk of his adult life milking and caring for his 45-cow herd outside of Wonewoc, Wisconsin, Goodman wanted to pass his life’s work on to the next generation.His plans fell through, however, when a young couple reneged on their investment, forcing him to sell his cows for a much cheaper price to a larger farm in 2018.In the years since giving up his herd, Goodman channeled his frustration into activism and rose through the ranks of the National Family Farm Coalition before becoming the organization’s president. Still, he remains saddened by the turn of events that preceded his early retirement.“We could see that it was only a matter of time until our small farm was just not viable,” Goodman said “The cheese factory that we were selling to was losing its market share because of cheaper products produced by bigger companies, and they basically told us they wouldn’t be able to buy our milk anymore. There just weren’t any other options.”The story of Goodman’s farm reflects a fast-moving shift in American demography — the consolidation of agribusiness followed by the hollowing out and graying of rural communities. For family farmers like Goodman, the fate of Wisconsin’s rural counties and towns are inexorably linked to the business model for agriculture — a business model that increasingly emphasizes high production rates for foodstuffs and rewards corporate control of farms and their produce.Competing with corporationsIt is no secret that the idyllic image of agriculture — red barns, small herds of grazing cattle and family-owned farm houses — is rapidly disintegrating.Wisconsin recently recorded the highest rate of farm closures in the United States, losing 69 farms in 2020, a net-increase of 12 from the previous year. In their place, large industrial-scale factory farms now dominate the market.Factory farms — also known as concentrated animal feeding operations — gained popularity in the 1960’s, and are defined as using extreme confinement of a high number of livestock for commercial use. The practice was designed to generate a high volume of food in a short period of time and often relies on packing thousands of animals into tight quarters for production. The minimum number of cows needed to classify a dairy operation as a CAFO is 700.These large-scale farming operations are frequently owned or directly financed by larger companies. Target, for example, unveiled its own line of produce in 2019.The rapid consolidation of agriculture left small farmers and activists in dismay. Family Farm Defenders Executive Director John Peck said corporate insertion into agribusiness blindsided dairy farmers who are now on the verge of losing their market altogether.“Some of them have these contracts where they’re providing milk for big cheese makers like Sargento who get their milk from a very small handful of giant factory farms,” Peck said. “Some of the big retailers like Walmart are now even setting up their own dairy farms. They’re not going to be buying from farmers anymore.”In addition to their well-documented history of alleged animal abuse, corporate-contracted CAFOs also pushed smaller farms out of the industry at a breakneck pace. Between July 2020 and June 2021, 48 farms in Wisconsin filed for bankruptcy, exceeding the state with the second-most filings by 17. In 2019 alone, the state lost 57 farms.Peck said Wisconsin lost half of its dairy farms since the turn of the century and that large, corporate-contracted factory farms currently control 25% of the market, despite accounting for less than five percent of the state’s dairies. In 1987, the average number of dairy cows per farm was 80. Just 15 years later, that figure reached 275.The continual decline in family farming is accelerated by an economic structure that emphasizes quantity above all else. The average cow produces roughly seven gallons of milk a day, meaning a farm with 1,000 cows can produce 7,000 gallons in 24 hours, whereas an 80-cow herd can produce just 560 gallons a day.Peck said companies such as Grassland Dairy are not only turning to factory farms as primary producers, but are also actively propping up factory farming as an alternative means of production.“Two years ago Grassland basically cut off 70 or 75 smaller dairy farms in Minnesota and Wisconsin,” Peck said “They basically threw a bunch of smaller dairy farms under the bus, saying that there wasn’t enough demand to keep buying their milk to make butter, but at the same time, they’re pushing for a giant factory farm in southwestern Wisconsin.”As the corporate takeover of agriculture persists, farmers are presented with a daunting choice: go big or go bankrupt.Due to their experiences with the hostility of today’s agricultural market, Goodman and Peck were both clear in voicing support for small farmers who grew their herds as a product of circumstance, with Goodman calling a debate between small and large family farms a “false conflict.”Rep. Dave Considine, D-Baraboo, of the Wisconsin State Assembly said the current economic landscape left many locally-based farms no choice but to scale up their production in order to compete with big agribusiness. Those who can not afford to expand their operations often face foreclosure. “We have to differentiate between company-owned farms and large family-owned farms,” Considine said. “There are a lot of Wisconsin dairy farms that are really family farms that just grew to support a family.”Controlling the marketThe rapid consolidation of the agriculture market occurred in large part because corporate America was allowed to gain a stranglehold over each step of the supply chain.After a relaxation of antitrust laws during the Reagan era, companies moved to buy up the production, distribution and processing of dairy, meat and crops.Today, four corporations own over 50% of the farm to table supply chain. After the corporate buy out of agribusiness that unfolded as a byproduct of 1980’s trickle-down policies, companies became free to pay farmers historically low wages for their products, even as the retail price for milk continues to rise.Yet, thanks in large part to a limited number of buyers, farmers are often unable to find alternative markets and are forced to settle for low prices. “If you go to the grocery store, you see thousands of products,” Goodman said. “So people think ‘the system must be working really good, because look at the selection I have,’ but there aren’t that many companies producing food. They’re just different brand names that have been bought up. There just is not an option for farmers to market anymore.”The absence of a diverse market places farmers in a bind. In order to remain operational, family farms often sell their products to a select number of companies who often rely on monopolization and cheap factory farm produce to fund their operations.“The big meat companies are basically holding their suppliers captive,” Goodman said. “So, they’re really not independent producers.”Thanks to their aggressive expansion and dominance over the supply chain, factory farms are now too big to fail. As a consequence, larger farms are often given priority for federal aid over family businesses.During the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, the top 10% wealthiest and largest farming operations netted the lion’s share of bailout money, earning 60% of federal dollars. The bottom 10% of farmers, meanwhile, received just 0.26% of relief funds.In the pre-pandemic years of the Trump administration, 82 factory farming operations acquired more than $500,00 in stimulus payments while the bottom 80% of farmers received $5,000 on average.Peck said he knows a dairy farmer who received a single dollar in federal aid.Leveling the playing fieldPresident John F. Kennedy once said, “The farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale and pays the freight both ways.”In perhaps no other area are the former president’s words more applicable than the dairy industry.The cost of producing milk in Wisconsin was $22.70 per hundredweight in 2020, yet the price of milk reached as low as 12.95 per hundredweight during the same year.The decline in milk prices can be attributed in part to the rise of factory farming. As industrial farms pump out thousands of gallons of milk which are then purchased by large companies, the price naturally falls as supply exceeds demand.The result is a market which is highly profitable for corporate agribusiness, yet leaves small farmers financially stranded. Nationwide dairy production rose by a factor of roughly 100,000lbs between 2005 and 2018, even as the U.S. lost over 10,000 farms during the same period.The volatility of the agriculture market leaves producers in a state of perpetual financial uncertainty, as a farmer could receive drastically different prices for the exact same product on a month-to-month basis.For all intents and purposes, farming is among the only professions in America that does not guarantee a minimum wage.To offset the plummeting price of milk, some farmers are calling on elected officials to implement a price floor for agricultural goods. These price floors, which would be adjusted for inflation, are designed to guarantee a minimum price for a given agricultural product and provide a lifeline to farmers like Goodman.“In the system we have now, prices that vary so widely,” Goodman said “It’s very hard for anyone to make a decent living and plan for the future if they have no idea what they’re going to be getting paid in the next month or a year. I think price floors will give [farmers] some stability about what they’re going to be getting paid, and what things are going to cost them.”Price controls alone will not alleviate the stress factory farms put on rural economies. A reversal of current trends will likely require a complete overhaul of the agricultural industry and a bottom-up reinvestment in small-scale agriculture.A potential solution posed by environmentalists and small farm advocates alike is a moratorium on factory farming. Such a moratorium would place a cap on the number of factory farms allowed in the country and facilitate a redistribution of farm aid. A moratorium could serve as an alternative to growing calls from climate activists to abolish the factory farming industry.Considine said he is not prepared to support an outright ban on factory farming, but believes a moratorium should be on the table.“In some ways, that makes a lot of sense,” Considine said. “Not to say you can’t ever do it anymore, but let’s take a minute and take a pause. Let’s really study the effects of this [factory farming].”UW students challenge big agribusinessFor their part, UW students appear to understand the gravity of Wisconsin’s ongoing farm crisis.Groups such as Slow Food UW make a point to work almost exclusively with small farmers when preparing and distributing their meals.Slow Food UW is an offshoot of Slow Food — a decades-old organization which prides itself on functioning as an alternative to fast food companies. The organization’s executive director and UW senior, Emma Hamilton, said the mission of Slow Food coincides with a commitment to collaborating with family farms delivering fresh ingredients.“Slow Food aims to make eating good food that is locally sourced and sustainably produced accessible to as many people as possible, and we do that in a lot of different ways,” Hamilton said. “We get as much fresh produce from local farmers as possible.”In addition to buying ingredients from small farms, Hamilton said Slow Food actively networks with farmers at locally sourced farmers markets.Hamilton described Slow Food’s relationship with local farmers as one which is based in both a desire for community building and respect for those producing food.“For us, it’s about making connections with the farmers that are at the farmers market, and wanting farmers to know we love supporting them,” Hamilton said “I think having that relationship with farmers is important and just respectful.”Student-led efforts to invest in family farming may prove to be a pivotal step in shifting away from industrial agriculture, yet Goodman expressed frustration with UW as an institution. Goodman cited research conducted by the university with backing from large corporations which centered around refining the same practices driving locally-based farmers to the breaking point.Among the top donors to the Wisconsin Center for Dairy Research’s Campaign to Secure Wisconsin’s Dairy Future were Sargento Foods and Land O’ Lakes Inc., with Sargento Foods CEO, Lou Gentine serving as the project’s co-chair. One of the major partners of the Marshfield Research Station is the USDA’s Institute for Environmentally Integrated Dairy Management, an organization which specializes in researching milk production and dairy cow performance.Goodman said he feels UW’s current research focus contradicts the university’s stated mission to promote the wellbeing of all Wisconsinites. Goodman said there is a need for research examining topics such as soil and animal health as opposed to studies focused on obtaining the maximum production out of an animal.UW College of Agriculture and Life Sciences News Manager Nicole Miller said in an email statement to The Badger Herald that the school has faculty members dedicated to animal welfare as well as federal grants to study topics in sustainable agriculture like dairy farm greenhouse gas emissions.CALS also hosts field days each year to share best practices with the state’s farmers, and the Center for Dairy Profitability aids farmers with succession planning by providing guidance on transferring farms to the next generation.“[CALS] is dedicated to supporting all types of agriculture across Wisconsin, the nation and the world,” Miller said. “We are always open to hearing from members of the agricultural community about ways to better serve them, including collaborative research projects.”Miller said farmers who would like to collaborate with the university or have concerns should reach out directly to CALS.Even with his concerns, Goodman is still hopeful UW will chart a new course and shift the focus of its research to encapsulate what he described as the Wisconsin Idea.“The university said it’s redefined Wisconsin Idea would center around the general welfare of the entire state,” Goodman said. “I want to see them to live up to that.”Adverse Effects Even as farmers, students and other organizations work to combat the immediate impacts of increasing mass agricultural production, the ripple effects of a consolidated agriculture market can be seen in the sharp decline of rural economic activity.Between 2010 and 2018, two-thirds of Wisconsin’s rural counties experienced a drop in their populations.According to the Wisconsin Office of Rural Health, 12% of rural Wisconsinites experience poverty, and almost one in five children live below the poverty line. The average unemployment rate for Wisconsin’s rural counties was 6.4% in 2020.Any hopes of a potential surge in revenue from factory farming appear to be dashed by a continuing decline in labor force size and the number of businesses hiring workers, even as industrial farming expands. Langlade County, for instance, saw a 6.5% drop in the labor force and a 7.9% drop in the number of businesses countywide between 2010 and 2018.From his perspective in the legislature, Considine described the ongoing trend as a predictable consequence of a truncated market. While factory farms may support a significant network of employees, Considine said laborers hired from outside of the community fall short of providing the same economic benefits as local farmers.“In regards to money circulating in the local economy, the smaller farm does a better job of improving our local community and supporting our local businesses, whatever they may be,” Considine said.For Peck, a farmer himself, the slow death of family farming is a far more sentimental issue.Peck views the continued loss of small farming as an identity crisis for Wisconsin — a state whose dairy farmers pride themselves on the quality of their products and the ability to support their communities.“Farmers I know don’t want to get an award for selling the cheapest, lowest quality milk possible, and that’s what’s so sad,” Peck said. “Our entire identity is being destroyed by an industry hell-bent on being the biggest, baddest dairy producer ever. That’s not our niche in the world.”",Go big or go bankrupt: Wisconsin farmers face daunting challenges as factory farms flourish,UWM

Merrick performed an evaluation of Cook after his arrest, and has had the opportunity to better understand his mental state in the aftermath of his crimes.After his evaluation, Merrick gleaned that Cook had four mental disorders: other-specified personality disorder with narcissistic tendencies, substance abuse disorders with both cannabis and hallucinogens, and sexual sadism disorder.Merrick suggested that Cook not receive a lengthy prison sentence, as they expose people to a “society of captives” that forces the prisoner to take on “antisocial, criminogenic traits,” which Merrick said in turn lead to higher recidivism rates.“Personality disorders take several years to address in a substantive way . . . I think it would be next to impossible to get the kind of treatment he needs in prison,” Merrick said.But Christopher Liegel, the lead attorney for the prosecution, cited Merrick’s testimony that Cook was not initially receptive to treatment.Cook pleads guilty to five felony counts, forced to register as sex offender
Former University of Wisconsin student Alec Cook pleaded guilty to five felonies at a court proceeding Monday, including three counts Read…As a result, Liegel said Cook should be confined for as long as possible — rather than hope for him to seek a rather costly treatment on his own.“Justice demands that he be taken out of society,” Liegel said.Before lawyers delivered their final arguments to presiding judge Stephen Ehlke, one victim’s mother testified on the impact of Cook’s crimes on her family, the families of the other victims, Cook’s family and, ultimately, Cook himself.There was no shortage of tears in Thursday’s court room, as Cook himself broke down while delivering his final statement, aimed at his victims and their families.“I’m sorry. I was wrong. You told the truth and everyone should believe you. This was my fault. You didn’t deserve this and neither did your families. To them too, I am so sorry,” Cook said.Ehlke, in determining the sentence, said he put much thought and deliberation into each side’s views, giving special attention to the victims’ voices. Ehlke explained that when making his decision, he considered three different criteria: the protection of the public, the gravity of the offenses and the character and rehabilitation of the defendant.Cook pleads guilty to five of 21 outstanding charges, now awaits sentencing hearing
In a plea deal reached Monday, lawyers for former University of Wisconsin student Alec Cook said he will plead guilty Read…On these standards of judgment, Ehlke sentenced Cook to three years in prison, followed by five years of extended supervision and three consecutive years of probation. In total, that means Cook will face three years in prison and eight years of probation.Ehlke elaborated that three years in prison would be congruent with Merrick’s recommendation to not issue a lengthy prison sentence, but would still address the gravity of Cook’s offenses.“It would unduly depreciate the seriousness of the crimes to only sentence him to probation,” Ehlke said.In addition, Cook will be on the sex offender registry for 15 years, is to have no contact with any of the victims or their family, must complete a risk and needs assessment and must not be on or around any UW campus.Cook has the right to appeal the decision if he desires.Shortly after Ehlke’s ruling, Cook was detained and led away by law enforcement.","After pleading guilty to five felonies, Alec Cook sentenced to three years of prison, eight years probation",UWM

The University of Wisconsin announced in a statement Monday it had suspended the Theta Chi fraternity due to violations largely Read…Additionally, the evidence members provided to UW in an attempt to clear their name was called into question and decisions made in the disciplinary proceedings were based on “hearsay instead of facts,” the press release said.“The Psi Chapter feels that it has been judged under a system with the precedent of ‘guilty until proven innocent’ rather than innocent until proven guilty,” the press release said.Theta Chi was originally investigated for allegations of drug and alcohol violations that occurred in November 2017. The first of those incidents involved a female high school student whose friends alleged hospital staff found rohypnol in her system after attending a party at the fraternity. That charge was later dropped after Madison Police found no legitimacy to the allegations.Saturday night sexual assault reported at unknown fraternity

In October, members of the fraternity were interviewed by the Division of Student Life.On Nov. 26, the chapter was notified UW was investigating yet another charge for hosting a social event where a majority of attendees were allegedly drinking alcohol out of coffee cups. Following this charge, on Nov. 30, Theta Chi sent letters to the UW chancellor and vice chancellor of student affairs to notify them of their disaffiliation.“Theta Chi no longer sees value or credibility in the Registered Student Organizations and [Committee on Student Organizations] given that violations of their own regulations have occurred in this investigatory process,” the backgrounder said. “In an effort to reduce the stress this process has placed on its students, the Psi Chapter will remove itself from formal university recognition and will now operate independently.”In response to Theta Chi’s decision, Argyle Wade, interim dean of students, said in a statement that the university is disappointed with their decision.UW said they made an attempt to communicate with the leaders of Theta Chi in hopes they would act “in a manner consistent with our expectations of our Registered Student Organizations,” Wade said.Wade added the health and safety of UW students is their top priority, and allegations putting students at risk are taken seriously.",Theta Chi cuts ties with UW over investigation into inappropriate conduct,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2021/09/20/century-of-discoveries-interconnected-tale-of-uws-most-innovative-research-epiphanies/,"Sep 20, 2021","The beginning of a legacyThe Babcock name is renowned among Union dwellers and ice cream enthusiasts, but far beyond frozen treats, Stephen Babcock represents the start of an enduring tradition of scientific innovation at the University of Wisconsin.In 1890, Babcock, an agricultural chemist at UW, developed the Babcock butterfat test. This test, which measures the fat content of milk, allowed the dairy industry to differentiate prices based on quality, incentivizing farmers to invest in improvements of their product.In addition to revolutionizing the dairy industry, Babcock’s test set a precedent for UW researchers to be at the forefront of their fields and translate scientific discoveries into improvement of people’s lives.Every major breakthrough at UW built off of previous research, and without that collaboration, some of the scientific world’s most significant developments would never have been realized. From the fundamental discovery of vitamins, to collecting images in outer space, and even to the pressing issues of COVID-19 research today, UW has been involved in every facet of the developments which are still affecting our lives today.Vital vitaminsIt was 1907 when E.V. McCollum joined the UW agricultural chemistry department. While working on a nutrition experiment designed by Babcock, he observed stark differences in the appearance and physiology of cows fed different diets. McCollum became driven to discover the unknown factor he hypothesized was causing discrepancies.McCollum’s unconventional rat-based experiments were only tolerated by the university due to Babcock’s approval of the project, but they yielded tremendous results. Working with graduate Marguerite Davis, McCollum’s studies resulted in the discovery of a fat-soluble nutrient, which would later be named vitamin A. McCollum and Davis also discovered the presence of a water-soluble nutrient, called vitamin B.Professor Harry Steenbock, a former lab assistant of McCollum, continued UW’s legacy of groundbreaking biochemical nutrition-related research through the 1920s. Steenbock was the first to determine increased sunlight led to calcium retention. He discovered shining food with UV light had the same effect.Through McCollum’s work, society was introduced to the idea of vitamins and the importance of a balanced diet — Steenbock took this research one step further. Through patenting and implementing his irradiation technique, Steenbock effectively eradicated rickets, a disease in children caused by a vitamin D deficiency that softened and distorted bones, as a widespread disease.In the process of independently patenting his methods and receiving commercial offers for their use, Steenbock saw the need for a separate entity to manage patents of UW’s novel products and use the revenue to fund future research. In 1925, the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation was founded.Building a networkWARF was the world’s first technology transfer office, a center now common among universities, which helps take research developments and transfer them into the commercial marketplace. WARF aims to transfer ideas born on campus out into the world, said Kevin Walters, the public affairs analyst for WARF.“WARF’s goal is to transfer ideas created on campus out into the world,” Walters said. “We want to be on the forefront of adapting, especially in such an uncertain time. With great challenges come great opportunities.”With catastrophically low share prices, the stock market crash of the 1930s was the ideal time to build an investment portfolio based on the royalties from Steenbock’s patents, Walters said.“The key to WARF’s funding is our investment portfolio,” Walters said. “With that we are able to give a consistent grant each year regardless of how much in royalties comes in.”Today, that portfolio has grown to $3.2 billion in funds, and over three billion dollars of grants have been awarded to UW through WARF.WARF’s largest investment to date came from biochemistry professor and former student of Steenbock himself — Hector DeLuca. As the last graduate student to study under Steenbock, DeLuca recalled in an interview with The Badger Herald being very excited to receive an assistantship with him. DeLuca said Steenbock’s work to enrich foods with vitamin D was legendary.DeLuca arrived at UW in 1951 when he began his graduate studies. In that time, he developed nearly 2,000 patents for use of primarily vitamin D derivatives to treat various diseases.DeLuca’s research provided therapies for osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and organ transplant rejection.Walters said DeLuca’s invention Zemplar, an active form of vitamin D which is used to treat hormonal imbalance in patients with kidney failure, was WARF’s largest investment. With three buildings named after him and a lifetime of dedicated work, DeLuca’s impact on UW research and campus can hardly be limited to any one development.“There are so many aspects to which I’m very grateful I came here,” DeLuca said of his time at UW. “I couldn’t have chosen a better place to come or person to work with.”UW and the Space AgeOne of WARF’s most vital scientific contributions on campus benefitted a very different field of research — astronomy. Astronomy Professor Jim Lattis said UW built Pine Bluff Observatory in the midst of the 1950s to serve as a new site for research with more modern capabilities than the historic Washburn observatory, built in 1881. Pine Bluff was home to a plethora of key research developments and housed equipment for both the astronomy and physics departments.In the field of astronomy, UW’s most significant involvement was the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2. Launched in 1968, OAO-2 was in orbit for four years, during which time it helped collect data regarding a broad range of topics in space. Lattis said OAO-2 had two central contributors, the Smithsonian museums and UW. Researchers at UW spent decades developing photoelectric photometry instruments that could be adapted to use in space. Before their discovery, the only option available to collect images was photography.“OAO-2 was in a lot of ways the culmination of years of astronomical development,” Lattis said. “It was one of the reasons we were ever able to run the Hubble telescope, and it showed the possibility of operating an observatory in space.”The method of photometry was groundbreaking, as UW was one of the only locations studying the discipline at the time, Lattis said. UW’s success with the instruments in OAO-2 would lead them to develop some of the original instruments for the Hubble telescope, which were also specialized photometry instruments.Lattis said space research slowed since these 20th century projects, but UW is still involved in several telescope operations and many astrophysical research projects.”I think learning about astronomy is fundamental to answering some of these philosophical questions in life, like who are we and what is our place in the universe?” Lattis said. “One has to keep engaging in these things to keep a healthy society.”Lattis attributed the success of astronomy research during the Space Age to UW’s willingness to take risks and fund novel projects. Lattis said the school’s generally supportive attitude encourages researchers to pursue their interests.The Biotron was another large investment in research advancement made by the university. The Biotron would prove to have immense payoffs and become a historic lab at UW. Dedicated in 1970, the Biotron allows researchers to recreate any terrestrial environment on earth by controlling temperature, lighting, humidity and plant-watering schedules.The Biotron’s unique capabilities allowed it to host several monumental research projects. In the realm of space research, NASA tested the Galileo probe at the Biotron before its launch. Food was first grown by LED lights in the Biotron in 1986. In the following months, astronauts in space used the same technique to grow their own food in space.The chamber was also used to test products like Arctic drilling equipment and insulin pumps. Even the Babcock Dairy Store’s cheese has been put to the test within the Biotron’s walls.After 50 years of housing research, the Biotron ended its role as a campus center March 31, 2021, however, its legacy and contributions to UW research will continue to be felt on campus for decades to come.Medicinal breakthroughsIt is virtually impossible to mention research legacies at UW and not include a key medical development — Warfarin. In 1933, School of Agriculture professor Karl Paul Link met with a distressed farmer whose livestock were inexplicably dying. After eight years of researching, Link was able to isolate a blood-thinning agent from the cow’s feed that was determined to be the cause of death.The agent was patented by and named after WARF, and warfarin became one of the most widely prescribed blood thinners in the world. Today, warfarin is used to treat or prevent strokes, heart attacks or other blood clotting issues.Another major medical innovation which emerged from UW was a surgical technique to remove skin cancer developed in the 1930s by Dr. Frederic Mohs. Mohs’ research, funded in part by WARF grants, led him to realize the value of using microscopy to treat skin cancer in order to ensure that cancerous cells not visible to the naked eye are removed.Dr. Juliet Alyward of UW Health is an expert on Mohs surgery and has performed the procedure over 17,000 times. In 60% to 70% of skin cancer cases, Alyward said the spread of cancer cells is often much larger than the tumor that is immediately visible. Therefore, Alyward said a method beyond merely observing a tumor with the naked eye proves invaluable.The procedure involves removing skin cancer using local anesthetic, then analyzing the removed tissue under a microscope. Multiple tissue removals can occur until the analysis shows the cancerous cells completely surrounded by healthy tissues, indicating the cancer has been entirely removed.Mohs surgery continues to be a relevant practice for over almost 90 years, an impressive feat in a field as rapidly evolving as medicine. Alyward credits a remarkably high cure rate of 99% and high patient safety as factors for its endurance.Monkeys and studying the mindHarry Harlow conducted psychology research with rhesus monkeys from the 1930s to the 1970s, and his work, while controversial, is widely recognized to have changed society’s understanding of mammalian development, especially regarding infant-mother relationships. Some of his most famous studies involved raising infant monkeys with either a wire or cloth “mother,” or completely socially isolating them in dark, sterile environments.As a result of Harlow’s experiments, psychologists gained pivotal insights into human behavior — the obvious detriment of being socially deprived demonstrates the value of social contact for emotional growth. Despite these outcomes, the studies have been heavily criticized for the developmental harm that resulted in the isolated monkeys.Harlow — alongside his wife and fellow psychologist Margaret Harlow — helped to change the face of parenting to a more engaged, contact-heavy experience. Primate center outreach specialist, Jordana Lenon, said parenting was a hands-off endeavor, with parents setting children up with nannies instead, up until the 1950s.“Part of their legacy is that parents today are much more involved with their babies from birth, Lenon said. “Frequently holding them, touching them, staying close by. Even babies smelling their parents, when combined with touch, promotes healthy brain development.”Harry Harlow was also the first director of the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, then named the Wisconsin Regional Primate Center. He effectively founded primate research at UW, which grew to be one of the most influential research centers on campus.The primate center facilitated major research breakthroughs, especially in the areas of stem cells and HIV treatments.James Thomson was the head veterinary pathologist at the WNPRC in 1995, when he became the first in the world to successfully isolate and culture stem cells from a rhesus monkey embryo. Three years later he replicated the feat in a human embryo and made national headlines for the new field of research he had just unlocked. Since his discovery, multiple projects entered human clinical trials investigating treatments of diseases such as macular degeneration and Parkinson’s.One particular study from March of 2021 using rhesus monkeys showed implanting neurons developed from the monkey’s own cells helped alleviate symptoms of Parkinson’s disease by about 40%. Researchers are hopeful that after extensive clinical trials that are yet to be conducted, a similar process could potentially act as a Parkinson’s treatment in human patients.In the realm of HIV research, the WNPRC helped develop life-saving medications, new vaccine possibilities and gel designed to prevent HIV transmission from mothers to their newborns. Most recently, a study involving gene editing to prevent reception of the virus by the body’s cells suggested a treatment for HIV may be on the horizon.Genes and vaccines: UW in the age of COVID-19 researchEarly genetics work conducted at UW includes Howard Temin’s revolutionary discovery of reverse transcriptase in 1975, which earned him the Nobel Prize and was essential for understanding how retroviruses such as HIV hijack healthy cells. Without this understanding, the WNPRC’s treatment research could not exist, because there would not be enough known about the virus’ mechanisms to intervene with them.Prior to Temin’s work, Har Gobind Khorana uncovered the way in which genetic codes translate into amino acids in the 1960s. His discovery eventually led him to earn a Nobel Prize after he became the first known researcher to synthesize a gene. Both Khorana and Temin’s discoveries would prove to be vital in addressing the medical world’s most recent dilemma — COVID-19.Temin’s and Khorana’s work with genetics paved the way for future researchers like Jon Wolff to work on delivering DNA or RNA into muscle cells. One of Wolff’s most influential papers demonstrated that delivery of DNA or RNA into muscle could lead to the expression of proteins. This technology was part of the foundation in which the mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were based.Two of UW’s own virologists, Yoshihiro Kawaoka and Gabriele Neumann, applied Wolff’s work and developed a nasally-delivered COVID-19 vaccine that is currently in human trials. The technology regarding the vaccine was patented through WARF and involves genetic modification which likely wouldn’t have been possible without the work of the UW researchers.The WNPRC is currently working on COVID-19-related research as well. Lenon said the center built a coalition of scientists to help fight COVID-19. Working with the National Institute of Health, the coalition used primate models to study virus resistance, transmission routes and organs the virus attacks. Renovations are also set to begin soon to construct a new UW Animal Bio-Safety Level 3 lab that will allow researchers to study COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and transmission in a setting that cannot be safely done in a lower ABSL facility.Lenon said WNPRC plans to continue researching pressing issues regarding COVID-19 including novel variants, and the mysterious “long COVID-19,” which involves patients experiencing prolonged symptoms of the virus months after testing positive.Looking to the futureLenon said the WNPRC’s research efforts have been a collaboration with centers across campus and even other institutions.“Nothing’s done in a vacuum,” Lenon said. “Scientists from different areas and different disciplines collaborate to find new ways to treat and cure diseases, and I think that’s amazing. What people don’t always think about is that science takes time. Even all of the COVID-19 research that appeared to progress at lightning speed was based on decades of studying.”The same can be said for most breakthroughs at UW. Behind every new scientific discovery is a history of prior work — each development building off of the next. Without Babcock’s encouragement, McCollum would not have had access to the mechanism to discover vitamin A, and without Temin and Khorana’s genetics work, the vaccines that now represent a solution to a global pandemic may not exist.Even now there is an abundance of UW research in progress that elaborates on the discoveries of the past. DeLuca is continuing UW’s renowned vitamin research, which may well be used to treat even more diseases in the future. Mohs surgery will likely continue to modernize, as Alyward listed multiple advancements in the works that would allow for even more precise removal of cancer cells. There is even an entire center dedicated to the stem cell research that was made possible by Thomson’s work with the WNPRC, which has found possible treatments for burn injuries, blood disease and even blindness. These projects and many more currently in progress are taking past discoveries and translating that knowledge to the improvement of people’s lives.With hundreds of projects in progress and WARF’s consistent grant firmly in place, UW’s research future looks promising, as it is a future built on a foundation of over a century of discovery.",Century of discoveries: Interconnected tale of UW’s most innovative research epiphanies,UWM

Though many students jump around for joy at this recognition, the institution itself recoiled at the ranking.Officially, UW referred to alcohol use on campus as “a pressing public health concern that negatively impacts campus safety and students’ academic progress and well-being.”The same statement also mentioned the AlcoholEdu program that is mandatory for incoming freshmen. No one, however, brought up the equally important Tonight program about consent and sexual assault, despite the proven relationship between heavy drinking and sexual violence.The pros and cons of being the country’s top party school
The Princeton Review named the University of Wisconsin the country’s top party school Monday. Two Heralders explored the good and Read…Compared to stone-cold sober schools (mostly religious and military institutions), party schools experience 600 percent more on-campus sexual assaults. Of course, when evaluating sexual assault prevalence reports, one must consider the fact that due to cultural pressures, stigmas and risk of re-traumatization, under reporting dramatically affects statistics about rape.Presence of heavy drinking culture further complicates risks of reporting, as survivors may feel guilty, fear blame or simply not remember what happened. Perpetrators lean on alcohol as an excuse, dodging responsibility and perpetuating toxic victim blaming. Both party schools and rape culture rely on alcohol as a scapegoat to shift blame onto the survivor and away from the perpetrator.The recent release of Brock Turner is a chilling reminder of how rape culture uses party schools to create excuses for rapists through excessive drinking. Turner sexually assaulted an unconscious student behind a dumpster before leaving her naked body and returning to the fraternity house where the party took place.Rejecting silence: Student survivors take control, speak out on sexual violence
Editor’s note: Trigger warning for sexual assault.  Waking up on Valentine’s Day freshman year, the night before was vague. Puzzled, I looked Read…When it comes to sexual assault, the problem is not alcohol or even inebriation. The problem is that through a patriarchal lens, presence of alcohol somehow immediately excuses the rapist while further blaming the survivor for being drunk.But we know better. The majority of sexual assaults occur with people familiar to the victim. No matter the circumstances, a rapist is just that — a rapist.As the fall semester commences, please keep Badgers safe by watching out for one another and intervening at parties or other events. Distracting a potential perpetrator or victim can make all the difference and only takes a minute. Uphold the true definition of consent as a clear, freely-given, enthusiastic, continuous yes and not the absence of a no.“Freely-given” means no coercion is present, including coercion via alcohol. Anyone who slurs, vomits, passes out or shows any other signs of inebriation cannot give consent.Sorority members are 74 percent more likely to experience sexual assault than their non-Greek peers, and fraternity brothers are at higher risk for committing sexual assault. These statistics appear grim, but remember — the majority of people in fraternities do not rape.Unfortunately, minority populations commit major crimes, and fraternities breed an ideal environment for potential rapists. Many fraternities encourage toxic levels of masculinity, insisting that manliness comes from aggression, physical strength and overpowering weaker individuals.Pledge and rush season present a particularly high risk for students, as they occur early in the year when everyone wants to find their place on campus. Perhaps unsurprisingly, sexual assault rates among freshmen women spike in October, or the “red zone.”‘Finally taking action’: Greek community to implement first major plan to address sexual assault
While Greek life communities across the nation have long been criticized for higher rates of sexual assault, few comprehensive studies Read…The first few months of the first two years of college present the highest risk, as students acclimate to their new environment, begin to experiment with drinking with people they may not completely trust and often explore the intense party culture attached to Greek life.Every university wants to be the exception to these harmful cultural norms, but before UW could even officially begin the fall semester, Badgers received a campus crime alert for sexual assault in a fraternity. Not only did the assault occur in a fraternity house on Langdon street, but the perpetrator used drugs to commit an act of sexual violence. These crimes occur right at home on our campus.Party culture and athletic events go hand-in-hand at UW. Many events — but particularly Badger games — are traditionally accompanied by binge drinking.Athlete status also often acts as a shield against sexual assault reports. For example, many media headlines referred to Brock Turner as an “ex-swimmer” rather than a rapist. Media coverage of countless sexual assault cases emphasize the loss of a great athlete rather than mourning the survivor’s deprivation of basic human rights and well-being.Any campus environment drenched in worship for athletes creates an atmosphere poisonous for reporting. It takes great courage for a survivor to come forward at all, let alone come forward to report a revered campus athlete.UW athletes take stand against sexual assault
In a two minute YouTube video, four University of Wisconsin varsity athletes took a stand and raised their voice against Read…In addition, the hyper masculinity running rampant in fraternities also exists in sports. The desire to overpower or win in sports culture translates easily to sexual violence. Even when survivors come forward to report athletes, they might be ignored or discouraged by administration seeking to avoid bad publicity.Make no mistake — I do not seek to condemn all members of Greek life or athletics as potential perpetrators. But the numbers do not lie — one in three college sexual assaults are committed by athletes and fraternity brothers are three times more likely to rape than other men.To stop rape and sexual assault, we must closely examine prevalence of certain factors. Reckless party culture perpetuates rape culture. If this fact makes you uncomfortable, good.

Even more disturbing is the phrase’s origin is the lips of the future President of the United States.It is extremely hard to deny rape culture is an integral part of our society’s fabric when the president-elect can say and do things to objectify women and make light of sexual assault. If the person meant to represent my country and its people, along with its morals and values, perpetuates rape culture and victim-blaming, why wouldn’t anyone else? Why wouldn’t I?I was sexually assaulted at the beginning of my sophomore year. As an avid feminist, sexually liberated woman and someone many friends referred to as a “mom,” I never thought it would happen to me, and if it did, I believed I would take the utmost steps to fight back.Reporting sexual assault, holding men accountable are critical in dismantling rape culture
At some point in her life, nearly every woman you know has been told by a man who is either Read…Instead, until about a month after, I completely denied to myself that I was sexually assaulted in the first place. This is when I realized how deeply I had been influenced by rape culture.Yes, I was drunk. Yes, I thought he was cute. But I said no.I said no when I told him I didn’t want to do anything past kissing because I was on my period, but he pulled out my tampon for me. I said no, but he tried to go inside me, so I offered a condom. It wasn’t until he tried to take the condom off when he finally listened to my no, and left.My first thought the next morning was confusion. Why was I upset when I enjoyed hooking up with guys and partying?Then I looked in the mirror. I saw the bruises all over my body and I knew this was different. I felt violated, but I also thought it was my fault. I danced with him, so I was asking for sexual attention.Objectively, I know these thoughts are pure victim-blaming, but that didn’t stop them from happening. Rape culture is so deeply embedded in to my psyche that I couldn’t see how much it influenced my own thinking.Because of this, for fear of being humiliated and blamed, I did not want to report the incident, though the thought was always in my mind. Then came election night.When Donald Trump became president-elect, I was scared and upset for many reasons. I could not, however, stop the feeling of relief when I thought about my decision not to report my sexual assault.Now, even the president wouldn’t take me seriously so why would any part of government, including the court system? A court system with an already shoddy track record, one which sentenced Stanford student Brock Turner to only six months in jail for a rape with hard evidence and two witnesses?It is sickening, but I believe going through a court case would do more harm than good for me, my friends and my family. It wouldn’t be worth the mild punishment for my assailant.I know rape culture exists and it has such a strong hold on all of us that rapists and sexual assailants never face the consequences they deserve, while the victims pay for their actions.Personally, I felt the only effective way to punish my assailant at the time while protecting myself and fellow women was to take action within the fraternity he belonged to. I was able to get him kicked out of the fraternity and start a conversation about sexual assault within its members.The court system undoubtedly needs to be fixed and I hope in the near future reporting sexual assaults will be the right choice for everyone in their personal situation. But fixing the court system will not make rape or rape culture go away. Education will.UW students march to shine a light on sexual assault
Students and members of the University of Wisconsin community gathered on top of Bascom Hill for the International Socialist Organization’s Read…Boys and girls must be taught not to rape. They must be taught that humans are not sexual objects. They must be taught that victims are not to blame for any acts committed against them.We need better sexual education in our school systems — including the University of Wisconsin  — and we need parents and teachers to know how to curtail harmful rhetoric at young ages so rhetoric doesn’t turn into belief — which turns to attitude, which turns to action. If the most important adult in America doesn’t understand rape culture, then adults are in dire need of education on the topic as well.Education shouldn’t stop in high school, but needs to continue at the university level, including UW, by ramping up efforts like the Tonight program.It is hard to connect to actors on a computer screen and actually take the program seriously, especially when it is summer time and the quizzes are easily passed with minimal attention to the material.

With over 4,000 active members each year, sorority and fraternity involvement represents 13% of UW undergraduates.Fraternity and sorority life at UW comprises four councils, one of which is the Multicultural Greek Council known as the MGC. Established nationwide, the MGC is dedicated to fostering an inclusive home for students from underrepresented communities and promoting multiculturalism on college campuses.COVID-19 variants spike so bad they’re now being named after Greek houses
As the Mu variant aimlessly flies up South America on its way to the U.S., the world’s scientists are watching Read…The MGC pursues the promotion of multiculturalism through advocating for equity and justice, developing relationships between member organizations and empowering members of its organizations, according to its website.As stated in Article II Section 1 of the MGC constitution, “the mission of the Multicultural Greek Council shall be to foster a unified multicultural community, to promote scholarship, service, respect, camaraderie and cultural awareness, while creating an inclusive and supportive network for future growth and development.”The Multicultural Greek Council at UW has inspired cultural awareness and inclusivity through its values, presence and overall impact on students, its members say.The UW Multicultural Greek Council’s values are displayed through its 12 chapters, one of which is Delta Phi Lambda — a non-exclusive, Asian-interest sorority founded at UW in 2018.

Each chapter must obtain a certain number of points throughout each semester to hold its good standing as a chapter.Points are rewarded through hosting and attendance of public events, social media recognition and GPA. Bonus points are rewarded to chapters that acquire a higher GPA.The Multicultural Greek Council does not only value academics but also social responsibility. Committed to educating its members, the MGC implemented requirements such as the Green Dot Training and Peer-to-Peer Education. The Green Dot Training and Peer-to-Peer requirement — sponsored by University Health Services — are programs that strive to ban all acts of sexual misconduct.Reclaiming Saturday: Students reinvigorate volunteer efforts across campus

As we are all trying to find who we are on a campus of about 34,000 undergraduates, the MGC offers imperative life lessons and social skills to its members.Zheng said she has found that the MGC allows people to find a place of belonging on campus, one where she said she does not “feel ashamed of [her] Chinese-American identity.”As members like Zheng have found their home in a multicultural Greek life organization, all students at UW should be inspired by the trailblazing values the MGC displays.The Multicultural Greek Council is a safe space where students feel accepted, and these organizations’ presence on campus shines a light of inclusivity in a world going through times of despair and social transformation.",Multicultural Greek Life: What are its impacts on campus community?,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2017/04/19/greek-life-is-misogynistic-and-that-is-that/,"Apr 19, 2017","I’m not saying sorority girls can’t be feminists. I’m not saying every frat boy hates women. Just getting that out of the way.One of the reasons bigotry, privilege and oppression never seem to weaken their grasp on our society — no matter how many passionate, fierce individuals are willing to stand on the front lines and fight for justice and equality — is because we lack an understanding of systems. We fight racists rather than systems of racism and anti-blackness. We fight against sexual assailants rather than combating institutionalized rape culture. None of that is working. So we don’t need to berate individuals, but Greek life, at its core, is a system built on misogyny. And needs drastic correction.Blatant sexism and heteronormativity appear immediately during rush week. For men, this week is an opportunity to meet frat brothers, smoke joints and get trashed. The whole process is relatively casual, and freshman boys spend the week getting a feel for each house at their own pace, selecting from a host of barbecues and beer pong competitions.‘Finally taking action’: Greek community to implement first major plan to address sexual assault
While Greek life communities across the nation have long been criticized for higher rates of sexual assault, few comprehensive studies Read…This is hardly the case for women. Rush week begins and ends with fretting over wearing the correct shade of lilac, turning closets upside down in pursuit of the perfect dress — one that doesn’t expose too much skin (classy women cover up!), but is still just small enough that nobody could possibly get the impression they are, god forbid, on the heavier side. Rush events are notoriously high-stress, as girls compete for the “hottest” sororities, touring one house at a time and taking great care to use the right words at the right time, with the right girl.While it may be true that girls meet close friends during rush week, it is also true they spend an unbalanced amount of time focused on physical appearance, social comparison and public image as beautiful, graceful and popular.Throughout rush and recruitment, while boys are not only permitted but encouraged to black out every couple nights, girls are barred from going out, especially to fraternity houses. They are constantly hyper aware of where they are, who they’re speaking to and who might see them. While frats actively seek out the boys who can drink the most, a good girl, worthy of a bid, will abstain.From the onset, men are groomed to put on display their most aggressive (read: most toxic) masculine traits, while women must contort themselves to fit an outdated — and, frankly, creepy and gross — mold of femininity. It is no secret sororities place much more weight on physical characteristics while fraternities value men who can get drunk, loud and laid.The problem here is not the fact girls are discouraged from drinking. If sororities were meant to be communities for girls who objected to a lifestyle of partying and going out, then by all means.But that’s obviously not the case. Once initiated, drinking at fraternity houses is a massive part of Greek social life. The whole purpose of banning girls from frat houses during rush isn’t at all to prepare them for what’s to come, and only serves to reinforce traditional stereotypes on how “elegant” women carry themselves.Further, despite the popularity of frat parties, sorority houses are prohibited from hosting parties. Alcohol and men are both banned — not because sororities have an undying commitment to celibacy and liver health, but because either it’s not ladylike, or the National Panhellenic Association doesn’t believe adult women have the wisdom (which men apparently have?) to handle themselves.UW Greek life changes sexual assault policy for first time in more than 100 years
For the first time in more than 100 years, the University of Wisconsin Panhellenic Association changed their policies to combat sexual Read…Aside: Banning alcohol and men from sororities, effectively forcing girls who want to get drunk with their friends to resort to fraternities where they are subsequently surrounded by alcohol and men, is probably not the best way to reduce instances of sexual assault in the Greek community.Formals, date nights and crush parties all reinforce Greek life is centered around heteronormativity and what seems to be an extensive mating process. As if that weren’t problematic enough on its own, absurd fines facing girls who bring boys into their houses suggest that in this odd realm of coupling, control over sexuality is in the hands of men. Women are commodities to be had, but lack the sexual autonomy to make their own decisions.I’m not saying sororities should immediately rent out a dozen kegs and throw parties. But whatever regulations sororities are forced to live under, better be applied to fraternities to.These old-fashioned commandments of Greek life did not belong in 1940 and certainly do not belong in 2017. Clinging to sexist tradition for the sake of tradition is dangerous, and undermines the positive tenants of Greek life – comradery, philanthropy and community. Revisiting the bylaws on sexual assault is a good first step, but needs to be the first of many, many to come.Yusra Murad (ymurad@wisc.edu) is a junior studying psychology, global health and business.",Greek life is misogynistic and that is that,UWM

I personally have read beautiful, soul-stirring commentaries on the situation from close friends, as well as seen impressive amounts of public support for the brave survivors that have come forward to bring this “alleged” piece of shit to justice.While I immensely support all that has been written against Cook and all assaulters, as well as in favor of the anonymous survivors, I do not wish to repeat them. Plus, I doubt I could do it nearly as well as Yusra Murad or Grace Ferolo’s pieces anyway, the latter of which sadly is no longer available for now.Reporting sexual assault, holding men accountable are critical in dismantling rape culture
At some point in her life, nearly every woman you know has been told by a man who is either Read…Instead, I’ll add my own two cents to address a specific, rancid part of this painful reminder of the toxicity of unchecked masculinity: the comments of Cook’s lawyer, Christopher Van Wagner.One of the most terrifying elements of Cook’s case is a sinister diary he kept. One in which he outlaid his plans, past and present, to assault. One page even had a column of names, simply titled “kill.”It’s enough to send chills down anyone’s spine. This, in addition to knowing Cook interacted with so many of my own friends on a daily basis, makes me want to throw up. The only consolation is knowing that the bravery of a handful of survivors allowed authorities to bring Cook to justice before he could reach the culmination of his wretchedness.Van Wagner, however, sees the journal entries a little differently. He said, and I quote, “People ask me, ‘what do you make of the notebooks?’ I was an English literature major in college —  every single short story I read could be and was interpreted in at least 12 ways.”To Van Wagner: First of all, no. Second of all, fuck no.I’m an English Literature major, and I don’t know what they taught you during your undergrad, but I’ve never encountered a short story, let alone an essay, novel, novella, poem, proem, letter, historical document or any text whatsoever where we did not let the authorship and context of that text inform our interpretation of those texts.So yes, there are ten interpretations of every Hemingway story, but each one takes into account that he was an antisemite. Same goes for Chaucer, a probable kidnapper and possibly a rapist, much like your boy.This doesn’t even take into account the fact that Cook’s journals are most likely not fiction, but I’ll digress.And I get it. He’s your client. Defense lawyers defend their clients, or so I’ve heard. But if you really cared about English Literature, Mr. Van Wagner, you wouldn’t have insinuated it in your defense of your piece-of-shit client.Also, tone it down. I’m sure you’d be chirping a different tune if you knew someone in one Cook’s diaries. Imagine, then, what it would be like to be a name in one of your client’s entries and then be told by some schmuck attorney named Christopher Van Wagner that they’re comparable to a work of fiction. They’re not.The only interpretation I’m interested in is the one in which Alec Cook is a nothing but a terrifying criminal and coward, worthy of the highest punishment. You don’t need to resort to twisting the field of English literature to justify his deplorable diary scrawls.Lucky for you, your jury will be likely be comprised of men mostly unaware of the situation, anyway.Henry Solotaroff-Webber (solotaroffwe@wisc.edu) is a junior majoring in English Literature and Spanish.",Ravings of a future stay-at-home dad: On Alec Cook’s lawyer,UWM

The majority of the art portrayed a negative reaction to getting unwanted attention from male strangers.Aside from simply discussing the issue at hand, the women at “Catcall to Action: An Artistic Expression of Campus Harassment” also shared with each other their personal experiences with street harassment. From being yelled at for not smiling back to calling the police for protection, the artists’ were fed up with the unwanted attention — and it was powerfully reflected in their work.At the moment, Scott believes there are more student-led initiatives to address the issue of sexual violence on campus, than administrative-led ones.“There needs to be more dialogue on campus,” Scott said. “We can’t just keep getting WiscAlerts hour or days after the fact.”She also created ceramic jars that directly resemble breasts that were on display at the exhibition. In modeling pottery in the form of the female anatomy, Scott raises the question of “whether to touch or not touch” the jars.“The jars create literal objects out of the female body the way women are reduced to objects at any given day of the year,” Scott said her artist statement.Despite the already provocative nature of her work, Scott was not done quite yet. She wanted “everyone to understand the meaning of ‘no’,” and enlisted the help of her fellow female artists to do so.Scott said she understands sexual assault and rape are sometimes difficult and uncomfortable topics to talk about. Often people won’t go get help and instead turn to darker outlets. In her opinion, she finds art to be an incredibly powerful and safe outlet when dealing with tough situations and has implemented this idea of “creating instead of destructing.” That being said, she hopes to share that outlet with others in hopes that it would provide a constructive way to deal with the “challenges that life inevitably throws at you.”As the final touch to her exhibition, Scott cut out strips of paper with common “catcalling phrases” printed on them. She placed them in the ceramic jars and plans to have attendees — an emphasis on male participants —pull them out and read them to have a better understanding of what some females face on the daily basis from something as simple as a walk home.“Hey Baby: A Ceramic Exploration of Campus Harassment” will be on display at the Campus Women’s Center from May 2-5 during regular office hours.

The idea that world-renowned surgeons, doctors and nurses might make a mistake while providing medical care is shocking. But it is all too common — the reality is, even experts can make mistakes, intentionally or not, often with serious physical and mental consequences for the patient.“Medical malpractice” immediately draws to mind overblown, oversaturated late-night commercials, detailing the horrific consequences of faulty vaginal mesh, hip replacements or exposure to asbestos. Online, social media is proliferated with bizarre cases of negligence, from amputating the wrong leg, to leaving surgical sponges inside a patient for years.After writing an article on Dr. John Siebert last year, I was dismayed to see his name emerge yet again next to the words “misconduct” and “negligence.” About this time a year ago, Siebert faced fiery criticism regarding an inappropriate sexual relationship with a patient, which required him to have a chaperone with female patients. The Wisconsin medical board reached the decision that Siebert’s actions were “a minor or technical violation” which were “not seriously harmful to the public.”First, do no harm. Disregarding the morally grey area of allowing Siebert to continue practicing in Wisconsin, several Facebook commenters let me know, in plain, if not condescending language, just how much good Siebert was doing despite his impropriety. A sexual relationship with a patient, they claimed, was not solely malicious, nor was it a valid reason to dismiss Siebert or notify future patients of his past misconduct.UPDATED: UW surgeon’s history of sexual misconduct reprehensible, but accepting responsibility crucial first step
On March 7, The Badger Herald published an article exploring the past of University of Wisconsin plastic surgeon John Siebert. Read…But these actions don’t emerge in a vacuum. They are often not isolated. If there is anything I have taken away from the #MeToo movement, it is that misconduct is not a singular event. It is a pattern, spanning power structures, gender, and years of silence. Siebert is no exception, it seems. Here we are, yet again.Feb. 1, a female patient filed a lawsuit against Siebert, alleging that he “failed to use the degree of care, skill and judgment that reasonable physicians would use in the care and treatment of a patient” when performing a tummy tuck and breast implant procedure. According to the complaint, Siebert disregarded the patient’s requests, and inserted implants larger than those requested, before making inappropriate comments and stroking the patient’s face and legs.I was disheartened, but not shocked, to find the comment sections of articles covering the lawsuit full of disbelieving and misogynistic remarks. What did shock me, however, were the numerous comments mocking the woman for receiving cosmetic surgery, with several stating the patient should be “happy” with the larger breasts. Others implied she made up the claim either because her own sexual advances were not returned, or because she wanted financial compensation after discovering the past allegations against Siebert.UW Health disregards student safety through employment of John Siebert

It is one thing to doubt allegations, and avoid making a judgment until a thorough investigation has been completed. It is wholly another thing to dismiss accusations of misconduct and malpractice simply based on the type of surgery a patient receives.Thousands of women receive breast augmentation or reduction surgeries every year. It is a choice they have made for themselves and their bodies. And yet, we still tie sexual impropriety and vanity inextricably to the women who receive such surgeries. We look down upon any woman who has the audacity to make a choice for her own body. God forbid.The idea that a doctor can dismiss the request and consent of a patient, and disregard the autonomy of that person, is unthinkable. Imagine waking up from a surgery to remove a tooth, only to find that the surgeon pulled all of your molars, too, because it “looked better,” even though you’d agreed before the surgery that you only wanted the one tooth removed.UW plastic surgeon had medical license suspended in New York following inappropriate sexual encounter

Certainly not pulling up photos of the patient, and judging “for ourselves” if she should “really be mad.”A person’s autonomy is not worth less simply because they are receiving cosmetic surgery. A woman does not deserve, nor should have to bear sexual comments and inappropriate touches merely because she has breasts and is not ashamed of them.Our society idolizes large breasts, while simultaneously shaming those who receive augmentation surgery. This mentality leads to the inexplicable perception that this case is entirely the patient’s fault — and not Siebert’s.The idea that someone “should be happy” with surgery they did not agree to would be unacceptable in any other context.

have found men in fraternities commit sexual assault crimes at a rate three times higher than that of non-Greek affiliated men.People join fraternities for all kinds of reasons. Many members cite the brotherhood and friendships they are able to build, the opportunities for philanthropy, leadership and resume building experiences and chapter alumni connections, which are invaluable in career development.These aspects are indubitably positive, valuable and important. In 2014, the Virginia Tech Greek community raised more than $350,000 and logged more than 30,000 community service hours. Alumni of Greek life have impressive track records in their careers, with 85 percent of Fortune 500 executives having belonged to a fraternity. Those who have been involved in Greek life frequently cite the close relationships with their brothers and sisters they have developed as a result of joining the association.Theta Chi fraternity suspended after drug, alcohol violations
The University of Wisconsin announced in a statement Monday it had suspended the Theta Chi fraternity due to violations largely Read…But to put it lightly, the positive aspects of fraternities fall short of the negative impact they have on their communities. The philanthropy and camaraderie simply do not justify the oppressive, misogynistic and recalcitrant party culture.There are many other ways to gain the benefits boasted by proponents of Greek life. Joining one of UW RecSports’ many athletic clubs offers the same opportunities for social events and development of friendships, and many clubs even partake in some kinds of service. UW has an alumni office that can help facilitate connections between recent graduates and alumni in relevant career fields. Badger Volunteers offers hundreds of ways to get involved in community service.UW is home to more than 1,000 different Registered Student Organizations, which provide opportunities to foster relationships built on productive and valuable common interests. The fact that many students forgo these opportunities in favor of joining fraternities show these benefits aren’t actually the priorities of rushing. Once members can re-examine their motivations for joining, only then can the issue begin to be resolved. But for now, maybe we should encourage men to pursue their philanthropic goals without the distractions of drugs, alcohol and girls.Cait Gibbons (cgibbons3@wisc.edu) is a sophomore majoring in Chinese and statistics.","Fraternity culture inherently broken, benefits can be found in less problematic setting",UWM

Drinking alcohol can lead to unsafe conditions. An altered state of mind impairs individuals which makes them more vulnerable to injury, sexual assault and even death. At the University of Wisconsin, 56% of students drink 0-4 drinks when they consume alcohol. This quantity of drinks can leave them impaired and at a higher risk of finding themselves in a potentially dangerous situation. No one wants to fall victim to any incident. If students were aware of their tolerance before entering college, they would be less likely to over-consume alcohol, which could lower the rate of crimes associated with alcohol consumption.It’s time Wisconsin stopped effectively encouraging drunk driving
When you think of Wisconsin, what’s the first thing that comes to mind? In a state that calls its baseball Read…While in Wisconsin, underage children can drink with their parents, this is not the case in all states. By making alcohol forbidden, underage people who want to experiment tend to be unaware of the consequences of drinking. If the legal drinking age was lowered to 18, people wouldn’t have to jeopardize their futures by obtaining and using false identifications. Many underage drinkers will quickly consume larger amounts of alcohol prior to going out instead of drinking over an extended period of time. If students could buy their own drinks, underage drinkers would be less likely to try to have older people buy them drinks. But by not purchasing their own drinks, they become more vulnerable to having something placed in the drink. The fear of getting in trouble for underage drinking also discourages people from seeking medical treatment when it could be necessary. These people are sometimes faced with the difficult decision of whether or not they should take an intoxicated friend to the hospital. If the drinking age was lower, this stigma would be erased and it would be more likely that these students wouldn’t risk not going.Don’t ignore the data — a drinking age of 21 is better for society
Last year, several lawmakers sought to lower the drinking age in Wisconsin. Though it received criticism from Mothers Against Drunk Read…Additionally, if the drinking age was lowered, the concept of alcohol would be more normalized and kids would be comfortable asking their parents questions regarding alcohol consumption. This increased knowledge could help kids understand certain dangers that they may not have previously been aware of. These dangers could range anywhere from mixing different types of alcohol to being aware of the different alcohol percentages. A lot of students begin drinking in college where they are in an unfamiliar place with strangers. A lower drinking age would mean people would be able to casually order alcohol at meals and have experience with it instead of starting with binge-drinking. If a person is old enough to have the responsibility of driving a car, they should be allowed to consume alcohol. While the legal drinking age is higher, people will have more dangerous drinking habits and experiences.

https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2019/02/26/silence-is-violence-cycle-of-abuse-in-juvenile-prisons-must-end-now-pd/,"Feb 26, 2019","Last year, the state legislature unanimously passed Act 185, a bill to dramatically reorganize Wisconsin’s juvenile correctional system and close two of its existing youth prisons, Copper Lakes School for Girls and Lincoln Hills School for Boys, by 2021.For years, the prisons have hosted a cycle of abuse — sexual assault and harassment, child neglect, abuse of prisoners, strangulation and suffocation — that went unreported to law enforcement and the parents of prisoners. Since 2014, the prisons have been under internal or criminal investigations by state agencies, the state and federal Departments of Justice and the FBI, all of which found evidence of prisoner and prison worker abuse and systematic attempts to cover up the abuse.Gov. Tony Evers’ proposed budget delays closing them within two years and includes allocations for more staff at the prisons, decisions which he hopes will ensure the new juvenile prisons and rehabilitation centers are properly staffed and equipped to meet inmates’ needs. But this decision leaves children behind in Wisconsin’s most notably abusive prison.Slavery is still legal in Wisconsin’s prisons — it’s time to change that
Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment nearly 154 years ago — Jan. 31, 1865 to be exact — by a vote of Read…When a Lincoln Hills guard trained other guards to use excessive force on inmates, when the prison’s chief psychologist mocked an inmate’s naked body, when multiple inmates attempted suicide in the same month, when a teenage inmates toes were amputated after a guard slammed his foot in a door, when inmates were sexually assaulted by staff and by other inmates — no one was held criminally responsible. Now that the governor has the opportunity to embrace a new juvenile justice system, he must do it as soon as possible.In January 2018, The Badger Herald reported reducing Wisconsin’s prison population requires that rehabilitation is the goal of juvenile justice. Youth Justice Milwaukee advocates for this approach, and has shown how involving community stakeholders and investing in community-based organizations and treatment facilities can increase accountability and reduce racial and ethnic disparities in juvenile justice.Much like its adult prison system, Wisconsin’s juvenile incarceration rates show devastating racial disparities. Of the 173 per 100,000 youth the state incarcerates, 147 are children or teenagers of color, the fifth highest disparity in the country.Data courtesy of Justice Policy Center, U.S. Census

After breaking into a liquor store and stealing a couple of bottles of liquor and gin, 16-year-old Sydni Briggs of Read…The Wisconsin juvenile correctional system, run by the Departments of Corrections and Health and Human Services, has two designations for young people under its control. “Type 1” refers to young people locked in prisons, like Lincoln Hills and Copper Lakes, while “Type 2” designates youth in a similar legal status to Type 1 prisoners but who aren’t imprisoned themselves.Act 185 requires the Department of Corrections open at least one new Type 1 prison for serious offenders and children convicted as adults and convert Copper Lakes and Lincoln Hills into adult prisons. For non-serious offenders, the act establishes a new class of county and tribal-run secure residential care centers. The other existing Type 1 prison, the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center, will roughly double its size.If the state’s goal is to emphasize rehabilitation in juvenile justice, it isn’t clear this is the way. While the transition to residential care centers may shift some juvenile offenders out of prisons, it isn’t clear how the centers would differ from prisons or if they will truly emphasize rehabilitation. Neither does the legislation clearly address Wisconsin’s juvenile recidivism rates — 63 percent for Lincoln Hills Schools and 71 percent for MJTC.Walker stays loyal to party platform, despite criticism from former cabinet members
With the 2018 gubernatorial elections fast-approaching, Gov. Scott Walker, in his bid for a third term, is unsurprisingly facing the Read…Clearly, closing Copper Lakes and Lincoln Hills by 2021 won’t make Wisconsin’s juvenile justice system moral. It won’t get rid of our collective impulse to punish society’s most impoverished and traumatized people — even when those people are children. It won’t do anything to close racial disparities in Wisconsin’s juvenile prison population or force us to confront the white supremacism that gave rise to the issue. It may not even leave Wisconsin with fewer juvenile prisons.But closing the prisons without delay will end one especially cruel incarnation of prison violence. It would show this administration prioritizes kids who are traumatized by the prison system it is responsible for.And it would be action — not silence or procrastination — against the state’s abuse of prison workers, teachers and children.Sam Ropa (ropa@wisc.edu) is a senior majoring in geography and anthropology.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2019/09/04/paying-the-price-how-uws-drinking-culture-impacts-community-as-a-whole/,"Sep 4, 2019","Many students at the University of Wisconsin wear the school’s high academic rankings as a badge of honor, especially since U.S. News recently named UW the 35th best university in the world.Badgers may brag to their friends at other schools that UW holds high rankings academically — and they’ll probably mention the university’s prominent social scene as well, which was recognized as number three on Niche’s 2020 Top Party Schools in America list.In addition to the rankings, UW students proudly throw the annual Mifflin Street Block Party at the end of April each year. But what is a point of pride for many students can also have some dangerous consequences.According to a recent University Health Services study called Color of Drinking, students of color report abstaining or nondrinking at a higher rate than white students. According to the study, a “nondrinker” is described as someone who has not consumed alcohol in the past two weeks but has consumed alcohol in the past year, while a person who is “abstaining” from drinking is described as someone who has had no alcohol in the past year.Regardless of alcohol consumption, its frequency or even a lack thereof, the consequences of alcohol can be felt by all members of the UW community.Effects of alcohol abuseAccording to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, excessive alcohol consumption can have serious consequences on college students. In addition to the obvious effects on grades, physical harm can also occur as a result of binge drinking.Every year, approximately 600,000 college students unintentionally injure themselves due to excessive alcohol consumption, according to the Alcohol Rehab Guide. These injuries include bruising, fractures, muscle sprains and other physical harm that can occur because alcohol alters a person’s sense of rationality, causing them to take more risks.Additionally, one in four college students report academic consequences due to alcohol consumption. This includes missing class, getting a poor grade on an exam or paper, or a lower grade in a course overall.According to the Alcohol Rehab Guide, not only does binge drinking pose a risk to the drinker, it can also increase a person’s likelihood of committing a violent criminal offense, something the University has witnessed firsthand.In March, a freshman at UW was charged with battery of an officer and resisting arrest after the UW Police Department responded to Witte Residence Hall for reports the student — whose blood alcohol content was 0.20 at the time of the incident — was urinating in the dorm’s hallway. While UWPD said this is a common call they receive, they also said students do not normally assault an officer.This incident is just one of many occurring on college campuses across the country. According to NIAAA, each year in the U.S. 696,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 report being assaulted by a student who had been drinking. In addition, approximately 96,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 report experiencing an alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape.According to Alcohol Rehab Guide, alcohol usage can also affect a student’s mental health, particularly if that student already struggles with depression or anxiety. A student who has pre-existing mental health issues can face “extreme mental instabilities” and “are most at risk of attempting to commit suicide or other acts of self-harm” because alcohol inhibits a person’s ability to think clearly.In the “Color of Drinking” study, when asked if alcohol had impacted the students’ health — both physical and mental — slightly more white students said yes when compared to students of color. In the survey, 13.7 percent of students of color said yes while 19.1 percent of white students said yes. Around 16 percent of students in both categories were unsure if alcohol consumption had impacted their health.Additionally, according to NIAAA the first six weeks of freshman year are critical because that is when a new student is in a completely new environment and has more freedom than ever before. This can make them most vulnerable to the more serious effects of binge drinking.Amanda Jovaag, Director of Prevention and Campus Health Initiatives at UHS, said the campus community as a whole is at risk when students use alcohol excessively. Three key areas — safety, connectedness and belonging — are the most affected by students’ excessive alcohol usage, Jovaag said.“UW-Madison’s high risk drinking culture actually just compounds health and wellbeing concerns that already exist on campus,” Jovaag said. “If we want to reduce sexual violence, if we want to improve mental health, the campus climate… They’re all related to that high risk drinking climate.”Jovaag added that excessive alcohol usage in college can affect students long term as well. She said liver damage and many cancers can occur from excessive alcohol usage, even if it is just during a person’s college years. But, UHS focuses on the most prevalent short-term effects that students face, such as sense of community and binge drinking, Jovaag said. Healthy Campus Team Manager Katherine Loving works closely with Jovaag in an attempt to improve the climate on campus as well.“[UW works to] center a culture of nondrinking and low risk drinking because again, a majority of our students are either nondrinkers or low risk drinkers, or are students in recovery,” Loving said. “I think that the high risk drinking on this campus is often the way the culture is interpreted, but that’s just what’s most visible.”Costs of overconsumptionAccording to the UW-Madison Specific Alcohol Beverage Regulations, the University’s official stance is, “Alcohol beverages are considered an amenity for a social or business occasion and never the purpose or focus of the occasion.” When it comes to University Housing, such as dorm rooms, the regulations state all assigned residents of a room and their guest must be of legal drinking age for someone to “…possess an open container of and consume alcohol beverages,” and they must do so only within their own room.Students who violate these regulations are subject to UWS Chapters 17 and 18 and may face sanctions from the University along with possible civil citations. These chapters outline the disciplinary actions the University may take against students who violate the code of conduct.One common problem area for alcohol consumption on the UW campus is at the beloved Badger football games. Many students enjoy tailgating before heading to Camp Randall, and that often involves the consumption of alcohol.In 2007, UW began the Badger Alcohol Check program. This requires anyone who has been ejected from Camp Randall, or who has been prohibited from entering, to do a breathalyzer before entering the stadium in future games. For students under 21, their blood alcohol content needs to be 0.00. For students over 21, their blood alcohol content needs to be below 0.08.According to the University, this program has made a positive impact because it allows students to continue to enjoy Badger football games, even if they have gotten in trouble due to alcohol usage. The program also prevents those students from re-offending at a future game.Many students have that story about a “friend of a friend” or “that person on their floor freshman year” who was sent to detox — or the detoxification center at Tellurian, according to UHS. The student’s phone is confiscated when they get to detox and they are taken to a room where they are monitored by Tellurian staff until they are sober and released from the facility.To be transported to detox, a student must be a danger to themselves or others around them. UWPD will also transport a student to detox if their blood alcohol content is above a 0.3 — the level at which death can occur. Students are then released from detox once their blood alcohol content reaches 0.00.According to University Health Services, a trip to detox costs $595. Additionally, students who go to detox may receive an underage drinking ticket that carries a minimum fine of $263.50 and may also have to complete an online class regarding alcohol usage that costs $125 as part of the sanction they will likely receive from the university.Given all of the possible consequences when someone binge drinks, it is worth it for students to carefully think about their decision regarding alcohol consumption, something UW is attempting to ingrain in students’ minds.UW’s efforts to curb underage drinking One well-known effort UW makes to inform students about alcohol usage is AlcoholEdu. Every new student at UW — both first year students and transfers — must complete the program. Otherwise, a hold is placed on the student’s academic record, preventing him or her from registering for the next semester’s classes.AlcoholEdu is completed in two parts. Part one is due approximately one week before classes begin and part two can be completed 45 days after part one. Students cannot register for the next semester’s classes until part two is complete.According to UHS, AlcoholEdu aims to “challenge students’ expectations about alcohol while enabling them to make healthy and safe decisions,” in addition to making the connection between alcohol usage and academic success clear to new students.Another key aspect to changing the drinking culture on campus and keeping students safe is to properly communicate the importance of appropriate alcohol usage to students, Jovaag said.City-wide efforts Alcohol usage at UW does not only affect students in their personal lives — the city has also recognized the issues it can bring into the downtown area.Madison Police Department Central District Captain Jason Freedman said alcohol is a driver of police response downtown, largely due to the dense area of alcohol availability.While there has always been a culture of drinking — and some crime as a result  — major crimes in downtown Madison have spiked within the past few years, Freedman said. In the past, there has been more minor crimes like disorderly conduct, noise complaints and urinating in public. Now, MPD has seen an uptick in crimes like felony battery, sexual assault and weapons offenses.“Our efforts, we believe, have led to an overall improvement and some mitigation, but has also led to some displacement and these are issues that really can’t be solved by police enforcement,” Freedman said. “We can control the fire a little bit and we can maybe move it, but we can’t put it out and we certainly can’t change the conditions on the ground that have made the fire so dangerous.”In an attempt to curb these more major crimes, Freedman said MPD and the city worked together to establish the Downtown Safety Initiative. DSI brings in around 12-15 officers to cover a small portion of downtown — mainly in the State Street/Gilman area. These officers work overtime from 11 p.m. until 3 a.m. to handle the increased likelihood of crime and make officers more visible and available, Freedman said.Additionally, Freedman said, MPD works closely with the Alcohol License Review Committee and the city council in an attempt to adjust the placement of late night food carts that tend to attract a large number of people in the streets and on the sidewalks. On the flip side, when UWPD officers are present, it is mainly because they are responding to a call, UWPD spokesperson Marc Lovicott said. Campus police do not aim to patrol with the purpose of finding underage drinkers, but they will patrol through residence halls making sure students are safe and well-behaved.In an attempt to curb underage drinking, an issue Lovicott also said is part of the UW culture and society, UWPD aims to focus on educating students when they get on campus. Lovicott said UWPD meets with first year students in their house meetings to explain the rules regarding drinking in the dorms and give advice to students for the safe consumption of alcohol.“This is an issue that we know is impacting our community and it’s been an issue here for a long time,” Lovicott said. Safe drinking for the school yearWhile there are always inherent risks, students can still safely enjoy a night out at one of the country’s best party schools. Freedman suggests those who want to enjoy alcohol should use caution when consuming it. He also advises students know what they are drinking and refrain from accepting drinks from people they don’t know as there could be more than alcohol in the cup.He also added that students should go out and go home in groups, rather than alone. Going home alone — especially when intoxicated — increases a person’s likelihood of being assaulted or robbed, he said.“Know your limits,” Freedman said. “I’m not saying drink responsibly, but if you’re drinking to the point of blacking out, that’s a you problem and that’s something that, from a cultural standpoint, we need to do better on.”",Paying the price: How UW’s drinking culture impacts community as a whole,UWM

It was conducted under UW professor of Law Emeritus and Special Assistant to the Athletic Director Walter Dickey.The review was presented to the UW System Board of Regents at a meeting on Oct. 4 and again at the UW Athletic Board meeting on Oct. 5. According to the press release, some of the recommendations have, as a result of the review, already been implemented, while others will be addressed in the near future.Nearly 700 student-athletes and 400 UW Athletics staff members were invited to participate in a health and safety survey.UW renews participation in AAU sexual misconduct, assault campus climate survey

Doherty said numerous recommendations for improvement were made based off the results of the review.Doherty, and Dickey in his letter to Alvarez regarding the procedure and findings of the review said a common observation among staff and student-athletes was the need for greater monitoring of access to facilities.To this end, the UW Police Department agreed to audit athletic facilities and to make recommendations about how to improve safety for users of these facilities, Doherty said.UHS reflects on impact of 24/7 online mental health resource

In his letter to the Athletic Director, Dickey said that while UW student-athletes are not hesitant to report health and safety concerns, there appeared to be confusion among students as to whom they should report any concerns to.“We are going to do everything we can to improve communication-related to reporting health and safety concerns,” Doherty said.The review recommended the UW Athletic Department continue their efforts in educating staff and students about reporting health and safety concerns, and that a concerted effort is made to educate student-athletes and staff regarding sexual assault and harassment prevention.New bill would promise student victims of sexual violence housing assistance, academic accommodations

from a panel of city and campus officials at a meeting Monday night.The panel included Madison Police Department officials, a city alderman and representatives of UW campus organizations addressed issues related to sexual assault, alcohol abuse and thefts in Madison.Jessica Dattalo, a peer facilitator with Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment, said
one of the biggest issues on campus is sexual assault and getting consent.Sam Rosenbloom, a student facilitator and Bradley Residence Hall resident, said a recent rape of an Ohio high school student and posts on UW-Madison Confessions Facebook page, where
users can post confessions anonymously, have contributed to the community’s avoidance in
addressing sexual assault.“It’s really important that we address the issue,” she said.Rosenbloom said she wanted to know whether providing lighting on Lakeshore Path and
adding emergency lights on campus would assist in assault interference.While it could be of some help, Dattalo said, acquaintances perpetrate about 70 to 90 percent of sexual assaults. She said social change would be more helpful in preventing
acquaintance rape, such as teaching people what consent is and how to ask. She said victims should not be blamed when a crime happens to them.“It’s never the victim’s fault that someone decides to perpetrate against them,” she said.Ald. Scott Resnick, District 8, added that Lakeshore Path does not have lights because it
is a nature conservatory. It has been almost a decade since any type of sexual assault has
occurred there, he said, although he said he does not recommend walking on the path at night.Panelists said to always stay in groups when out and stay on streets such as State Street at
night rather than ones like Langdon Street.Thirty percent of sexual assaults are reported to campus police, which is a small number,
Dattalo said.The police department is partnered with the Rape Crisis Center, which can provide longer-term support, MPD Lt. Kelly Donahue said, adding it is important
to report and tell others of being sexually assaulted.Dattalo said University Health Services also provides rape crisis counseling.The panel also addressed other issues on campus like alcohol consumption and burglaries.Resnick said low-level events often have the potential to escalate to something
greater, particularly house parties, that are not reported when they should be. This can
lead to dangerous situations, he said.“[For the] City of Madison Police Department, the number one priority is to help out
the victims,” Resnick said. “And even if someone is under the influence, that shouldn’t
mean they shouldn’t report a serious crime that’s going on.”He also said burglaries and robberies happen everywhere, including to those walking between dorms and during the daytime.He said he recommended not walking with a phone or with any other valuable belonging exposed. In
addition, he said it is important to lock doors, especially living on the ground floor of a
building.Every year, thefts have been especially prevalent on Spring Street and Regent Street, he said,
and residents can change locks if reported to the city inspector or landlord.Donahue said she recommends stopping mail over breaks because piled-up mailboxes
are a giveaway that the apartment is unoccupied.She and other panelists encouraged calling the police non-emergency line when anything
seems suspicious. She said the number is 608-255-2345.“If something doesn’t feel right, it’s because something isn’t right,” Donahue said. “And

https://badgerherald.com/news/2015/09/10/asm-kicks-off-year-with-uwpd-gp/,"Sep 10, 2015","At Associated Students of Madison’s first meeting, University of Wisconsin Police Department’s Sue Riseling laid the department’s evolving strategies for longtime campus safety issues.Riseling addressed UWPD’s plan to target high-risk drinkers on campus. UWPD found overconsumption of alcohol was higher in white drinkers.Based off these statistics, Riseling said they’re trying to be statistically accurate and not exclusive with how they monitor drinkers, and that will come in the form of targeting a white audience.“What we know statistically is that overconsumption of alcohol is predominantly a white problem,” Riseling said.Two other audiences Riseling said UWPD will be focused on in terms of drinking will be athletes and Greek Life.“We have an abundant supply of alcohol, and we get a fresh group of incoming students every fall that, for some reason, have to drink the town dry in the first month of school,” Riseling said. “And there will be a lot of students needing to go to detox.”The average age of students who go to detox is 18, with an average blood alcohol content of .23, Riseling said.Referring to the first 45 days initiative, Riseling said University Health Services and Division of Student Life will be doing prevention work and educating students.UWPD will also be in residence halls communicating the effects of alcohol to students. But Riseling said at the end of the day, the department will be making sure medical assistance is provided when necessary and people get the detoxification they need.Sexual assault, Riseling said, is of top priority for the police department. With their “Don’t Be That Guy” campaign already receiving national attention, the department will push the campaign further as the next phase will focus on violence in same-sex couples.Previously, UWPD released a campaign called “Tell Us,” which encouraged victims of sexual assault to come forward about their experience.“We think that the ‘Tell Us’ helped have some impact in the number of reports,” Riseling said.In the campaign’s history, reports have continually increased with 164 assaults recorded last year, she said.The campaign’s success typically has led to justice for victims.“Every single sexual assault that was reported to UWPD last year resulted in the arrest of an offender,” Riseling said.Following the release of Association of American Universities’ sexual assault numbers in the third week of September, UWPD will be releasing their own data on Oct. 1 of sexual assaults for UW in an annual report to the state.Riseling also addressed the police department’s plans to implement body cameras in the next month. They expect to have equipment on-the-ground Oct. 1.Riseling said officers would have had the cameras sooner, but there was a backlog of cameras due to high demand. But now that they have arrived, officers have already begun training with the cameras.“Body cam footage will be publicly available,” Riseling said. “Footage will be kept for 180 days. If there’s something on it that is of evidentiary value, it’s tagged and goes with the case. And then it will stay alive as long as the case is alive.”",UWPD to take on high-risk drinking problem statistically predominant in white students,UWM

Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway announced $150,000 total in aid in July to three non-profit organizations — the African Center for Community Development, Freedom Inc. and UNIDOS Against Domestic Violence — to support immigrant households.Freedom Inc. Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director Kabzuag Vaj works with low income, no-income, low-wage workers and queer, Black, South-East Asian women and young girls. Vaj said prior to the pandemic, this population was already disproportionately impacted by the government’s non-investment in their communities.UPDATED: Teaching assistants march to UW Chancellor’s house, challenge safety of fall semester restart plan
The Teaching Assistants Association protested in-person classes Saturday in a march to the official residence of the University of Wisconsin Read…The pandemic highlighted issues within these communities, Vaj said.“A lot of our folks are low-wage workers who are essential workers, and so while everybody is safe at home … practicing safer at home ordinances, we have moms who have to work because they’re essential workers, but then who’s taking care of the kids at home?” Vaj said. Vaj said before the pandemic, Freedom Inc. was working with a population already impacted by disparities around poverty, housing and health. According to Vaj, many people were hoarding supplies in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but what they did not understand is poor people couldn’t afford to hoard.Vaj said distance learning amplified inequities, particularly with students of color who came from predominantly poor families. Vaj said many did not have access to the internet or computers. Wisconsin, UW chapters of College Democrats plan reforms to tackle internal racism

To support Latinx households, UNIDOS Against Domestic Violence received $50,000 in aid from the City of Madison.Executive Director for UNIDOS Against Domestic Violence Veronica Figueroa said UNIDOS provides hotel vouchers, rent assistance and aid with eviction prevention to victims of domestic violence because these populations need safe places to stay.New COVID-19 Connect app provides information, support to Wisconsin residents
University of Wisconsin faculty and students created a free app to provide updates and important information regarding COVID-19 to Wisconsin Read…“We often end up having to find funding someplace else, whether that is our house or even our own family members for paying for hotel vouchers for people to go in until we kind of figure out how to or where to find a permanent housing situation for survivors,” Figueroa said. Figueroa called the financial aid a “relief.”Figueroa said COVID-19 increased violence in the Madison community, both in domestic violence and sexual assault, specifically in children. This increase happens every time there is a disaster, which is why it is necessary for them to be prepared to deal with an increase in violence. Figueroa said it is important to continue to request elected officials come up with a plan and funding to help organizations like UNIDOS deal with situations and to sustain the programs.The $50,000 in aid is still not enough in terms of housing, Figueroa said.“With the relief funds that the county and the city and the state are receiving, making sure that those relief funds are being allocated across the board and just chunking the money to specific organizations, they should rather look at other organizations that are doing the work and spread that wealth among all of us to coordinate services,” Figueroa said.According to Vaj, $50,000 in aid might seem a lot, but giving a thousand dollars to one family will only help 50 families, which is a very low number next to the large number of families that are financially affected by the pandemic.Vaj said the government needs to figure out a collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic because it has the power and resources to keep people safe.Student-athletes to wear black ‘W,’ show support for underrepresented students
Following the creation of a petition signed by current and former University of Wisconsin student-athletes, the athletic department announced a Read…Vaj said many organizations, including Freedom Inc., are turning to a mutual aid model, which she said is a part of people of color community models where POC help each other out. Vaj said a moratorium is not enough and Dane County needs to cancel rent.“People who’ve had two household incomes now have one, and people who had one now have nothing, basically,” Vaj said. “[$50,000] is not even enough to keep 50 people off the street or to help them pay for rent so that they’re not homeless and getting evicted.”Figueroa said there is a need for better strategies to deal with violence during disaster. Figueroa added people are aware this is not the first pandemic the world experienced and these situations are known to increase violence, but communities are still not prepared to deal with this rise. According to Figueroa, instead addressing situations through a crisis-response approach, it is more effective to utilize prevention strategies because organizations cannot sustainably work in a crisis mode.“Eventually, the whole philosophy will collapse if we continue to work on a crisis-basis every time one of our little ones gets shot and dies to then go and put a press release out there, or come out and do another March,” Figueroa said. Figueroa said being proactive and cooperating within communities is necessary and different voices need to be heard. Elected officials can’t continue to make decisions without input from communities, Figueroa said.","Madison nonprofits providing essential services struggle, lack funding",UWM

New members were also fed wasabi-infused foods and forced to sleep in their attic.Reesor said that the team aims to work with the fraternities and sororities, not against them.“Our shared goal is for students to be healthy and safe and for fraternities and sororities to contribute positively to the campus community through their shared values of scholarship, leadership, service and brotherhood/sisterhood,” Reesor said._________Correction: A previous version of this article mistakenly identified the Chi Phi fraternity as Chi Psi.

According to a report requested by 27 News to the Department of Corrections, from 2018-2019, youth-on-youth assaults at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake increased from 118 to 165 and youth-on-staff assaults increased from 109 to 162. Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee, explained the importance of safety in these facilities.“It’s going to be very difficult for a juvenile to make progress on those challenges if they don’t feel safe in the facility,” Goyke said. MPD report reveals difference in arrest trends
The 2018 Madison Police Department annual report shows the number of adult males arrested was much higher than females for Read…Goyke said the American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit years ago on behalf of abused juveniles at Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake. The lawsuit resulted in a special court monitor to track the use of restraints, pepper spray, solitary confinement and cases of abuse, according to Goyke.Goyke said after the special court monitor there was a reduction in the use of restraints, pepper spray and solitary confinement, but he explained those conditions are not eliminated, and there continues to be challenges in how incarcerated youths are treated in Wisconsin.Youth Justice Milwaukee is a campaign formed three years ago in response to the crisis at Lincoln Hills. Co-founder Sharlen Moore said the campaign is designed to advocate for young people and their families.  “It is definitely good that the facility stopped using those abusive and inhumane practices, but we still have a long way to go in regards to making sure that facility is permanently closed for young people,” Moore said.Wisconsin county jails charge higher than national average for inmate phone calls, study shows
According to a new study, some county jails in Wisconsin are charging significantly higher than the national average for inmates Read…Goyke said Act 185 was passed in 2017 to close Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake by 2021. However, Goyke said it is unlikely right now that Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake will close as there is not a viable alternative in the form of more expanded local facilities.  According to 27 News, a survey from October found that 44% of inmates feared for their safety, and 48% felt they have been threatened or beat up in the last six months. Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, discussed the potential causes for the juvenile assaults at Copper Lake and Lincoln Hills. “I believe part of the reason is because we see juvenile corrections as a mini adult system and it’s not,” Taylor said. “How we treat juveniles should be profoundly different than how we treat adults and we have not fully embraced that as a state under the present majority.” Taylor said the closure of Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake is one of the few bills to be unanimously passed across both houses. However, Taylor said the main problem is the majority not willing to provide the funding to make changes happen.   Moore said she is advocating for the new facilities to be smaller home-like facilities with four to 10 beds.Acting Police Chief Victor Wahl passes on permanent role

Goyke said he is not aware of any plans for the model Moore is pushing for. “There is a counter-economic argument that can be made,” Goyke said. “If we do it better, we actually can reduce costs because we have less kids coming back.”  Goyke was unsure of the exact structure of the new facilities. Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, said she would like if the new facilities do not resemble a prison as much as they presently do. She added the new facilities would have improved staffing ratios and ways to help strengthen young peoples’ families. “I would make it extremely robust programming for young people to help them connect to pathways to be productive involved citizens,” Taylor said. “We have to do it because our mass incarceration costs [are] going to bankrupt us as a state if we don’t change the way we do things.”New app connects Dane County residents with police

Taylor said the DOC is inadequately funded which leads to a shortage in overall staffing of correctional officers, causing many of the officers to work unreasonable hours and overtime. Taylor said the entry-level salary for correctional level officers is low as well. Moore added that there is a shortage in other staff as well such as teachers, health practitioners and psychologists. Moore said in Merrell county, the population of young people is predominantly black and brown, and the staff is predominantly white people. “There is no cultural competence when it comes to having staff that reflect the demographic of the young people that they’re serving,” Moore said. Goyke said Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake are big facilities with a capacity of 519 and a current population of around 130. These facilities make it really hard to separate kids based on risk or relationships and hard to develop family-type relationships, Goyke said. Madison police implement new use of force training

Moore added that YJM aims to get rid of the serious juvenile offender distinction.   Goyke spoke on the importance of these facilities particularly in regards to the youth’s future. Goyke said the whole point of this is to reduce recidivism and to ensure to do the best so youths do not come back.“The true issue here is that we have to invest in our children, they’re our future,” Taylor said. “It’s getting to the root of the harm that was caused to them, getting some healing for them as well as accountability for the harm that they have caused to others.”  ","Legislators work to develop new, smaller facilities for juveniles",UWM

Five years ago, around 100,000 protesters flocked to Madison in opposition of Gov. Scott Walker’s Act 10 education reform, a Read…While freedom to express one’s own opinion sounds great, in practice, the act is sloppy and can become physically violent, Riseling said. It is the police’s role to help facilitate an environment in which people can have an open discussion and be frank about the challenges others are facing.Democracy is not meant to give one person’s voice over another person’s, it’s supposed to be a give-and-take in which a person is listening to what the other person has to say — not just waiting for their turn to talk, she said.The police’s role is to keep an environment in which all of those things can happen and to ensure that environment does not breakdown so people can keep doing what they need to, Riseling said.“We set the table, but we don’t eat the meal. Folks have to eat the meal — we are there to ensure that everyone can do what they need to do in a way that results in no one getting physcially hurt,” she said.Though Riseling said the police may create a physically safe environment, it is difficult to create an emotionally safe one. It’s hard for police to try to prevent people from using hurtful words because it is not up to them to regulate what people say, she said.Circa 2005 — with a cameo from @WISCTV_News3 photojournalist Kathy King! #Riseling25Years pic.twitter.com/1FuclU87WY— UW-Madison Police (@UWMadisonPolice) March 11, 2016Riseling stressed the importance of creating a nonviolent environment, not only on campus but around the nation. A safe environment would allow people to exchange ideas more openly and peacefully in hopes to invoke more positive energy among one another, she said.As she looks back at her years at Wisconsin, one of the main reasons Riesling said she’s stayed in Wisconsin for so long is because of the students.Since she’s been police chief, more than 220,000 degrees have been confirmed at University of Wisconsin — something Riseling said is “pretty cool.”The students are what make the job fun, Riseling said. It’s fun to watch the various generations that have passed through this university and see what they will grow to become, she said.“I think it’s a fun place to go to school and it’s a fun place to work, it’s been a really big honor to be police chief for this long,” Riseling said.","Twenty five years in, UWPD Chief talks challenges, struggles on the job",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2013/11/04/rape-culture-does-not-exist/,"Nov 4, 2013","Editor’s Note: trigger warning for sexual assault.We’ve all heard the term “rape culture” before and it’s time to set the record straight. The United States of America doesn’t have a culture of rape any more than it has a culture of murder. This term aggressively paints men as dangerous and as the root of evil.I know that people are out there on the fringe of reality who are going to criticize me for what I’m about to explain — but somebody has to explain this. My hope is that you read what I am about to say, and save your judgment until you finish reading.The first thing everybody needs to understand is that bad people exist. This is the reason for murder, rape, child abuse, domestic abuse and all sorts of crimes. It is the reality of the world. Crime is not unique to the United States, and if you put a spotlight on rape, you don’t understand the real issue.Next let’s take a look at what people often attribute to this non-existent rape culture.I’ll be the first to admit that music lyrics can be extremely degrading towards women. Turn on any rap song and you’ll quickly hear some woman being described as a sex thirsty whore. Switch to the next rap song and you’ll likely hear about shooting people, selling drugs or the degradation of the black community.How come none of the latter is attributed to any sort of culture, but the former is a sign of a rape culture? If music and movies speak of and depict murder, then do we have a culture that accepts and promotes murder as well? Of course we don’t.I’ve never seen a feminist in a blaze of fury over the fact that Wiz Khalifa promotes illegal activity, and I don’t care that he does either. But why is there a double standard?You’ll often hear very uneducated people make statements like, “If people taught their sons not to rape women then we wouldn’t have a problem.” There are a couple of problems with this statement.First, it’s incredibly ignorant. Anybody who’s ever watched the news knows that rape is illegal, and yet the above paints the picture that our society is failing to educate young men on rape. Secondly, it implies that education can prevent true acts of evil. We teach kids not to murder and rob, but people still do it. Once again, you can’t always stop criminals.Finally, statements like that put all the blame on men and put no blame on women. There’s no doubt that women are more often the victims of sexual assault and rape, but many men are assaulted and raped as well. Then why aren’t we teaching our daughters not rape?A woman drugged a close male friend of mine, who was a superstar athlete, so that she could assault him. There was little outrage, but could you imagine if a superstar athlete drugged a random woman and raped her? It’d be on the national news by morning.This last part is likely going to blow up my Twitter feed with hate tweets.It is unfortunate that some women feel the need to exploit anything that may be rape for publicity. Not everything that is claimed to be rape is actually rape, and false accusations only take away from the credibility of real victims.For example, I’ve heard many women tell me they regretted having sex with somebody, and that if anybody asked them they’d just lie and say they were too drunk to remember. It’s people like them that are huge problems. Why are women so desperate to demonize men that they’ll lie about being raped?Let’s focus on those that truly need our help, and let’s stop evil people when we can.David Hookstead (dhookstead@wisc.edu) is a junior majoring in political science.",‘Rape culture’ does not exist,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2020/05/02/a-female-dominated-field-while-more-women-continue-to-go-into-journalism-barriers-still-present/,"May 2, 2020","Take a look at the masthead of The Badger Herald or the attendance roster for many journalism classes at the University of Wisconsin — the names and faces that make up those lists are predominantly female. According to the UW Spring Enrollment report, the UW School of Journalism and Mass Communication is a whopping 78% female. In fact, it’s more common in the United States for women to have a degree in journalism than it is for men, with 67.7% of the people in the U.S. with a journalism degree being women, according to Data USA.But the makeup of the journalism workforce tells a different story. The Women’s Media Center report, “The Status of Women in the Media in 2017”, noted men have received 84% of the last century’s Pulitzer Prizes. Sixty-two percent of all bylines and other credit in print, television, wire and digital news also belong to men. While the number of female reporters is rising, in 2018, women made up only a little over one third of newsroom employees in the U.S. — and this number only decreases for women of color, according to the American Society of News Editors’ Diversity Survey.This small amount of progress took many years to come about.(Her)story of Women in JournalismAssistant Professor in the UW School of Journalism and Mass Communication Kathryn McGarr has seen this trend throughout her work.“The J-School in Madison is overwhelmingly women, and I think there is a larger trend of more women in journalism programs,” McGarr said. “But then unfortunately, there’s been less and less women who are in the profession, and then fewer women reporters, and then even fewer women editors and managers. So as you go up the ladder, you get fewer and fewer women in positions of power.”McGarr’s research focuses on reporters in Washington, D.C., in the 1940s and 50s who wrote about foreign policy and their social and professional networks. And while McGarr said a lot has changed for female journalists since the 1950s, the lack of female journalists can be traced back to men actively trying to keep women out of reporting during that time period. “I think one of the things that surprised me most, at least in Washington journalism, was how actively men reporters kept women from being reporters,” McGarr said. “There were a lot of women who were reporters, but for example, they couldn’t really cover the foreign policy beat because they weren’t allowed in the spaces where those conversations were happening.”Exclusion was a common theme in journalism throughout the 1950s and 60s because though women could be hired at major newspapers, they were not allowed in many of the spaces that men were, McGarr said.And this exclusion of female journalists went on well into the 1970s, McGarr said, until women at the New York Times, as well as at Newsweek, filed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaints under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. “So the 1970s was this watershed moment where there had been this problem, and women had recognized that it was a problem, and it sort of took this federal intervention for anything to be done about it,” McGarr said. But McGarr said since the 1970s, the work environment has improved for female journalists.“It certainly has gotten a lot better — it is not perfect, of course, and there is still kind of a male-dominated culture that goes with it,” McGarr said. “But, nothing like it was before that period.”Slow ImprovementEditor-in-Chief of the Daily Cardinal, another UW student newspaper, Robyn Cawley also believes things are changing in journalism with more female reporters entering the workforce than ever. Cawley said she has seen this in the Cardinal’s predominantly female office. “I do think that our paper is very, like feminine and very female run,” Cawley said. “The past two management teams [we have had] have been both female. And I think doors are opening for more conversations, and it feels more natural [to have] women running this office and being present in the office.”Board Chair for The Badger Herald Peyton David has also seen this change in their newsroom, as there has been “a matriarchy,” for many years at the paper. Former staffer at the Herald and current reporter at The Wisconsin State Journal Emily Hamer also saw this trend in her time with the Herald. “I think everybody who worked at the Badger Herald — or the vast majority of the people who worked at the Badger Herald — on our staff were women,” Hamer said.But McGarr believes this observation could simply be part of the larger trend in the U.S. of women getting degrees in journalism, but not becoming reporters.In fact, Hamer said when she started working at the Wisconsin State Journal, she was surprised with the amount of men in the office. “I think most of the older reporters in the Wisconsin State Journal newsroom are men, and it was just — I was used to being sort of surrounded by women at the Herald,” Hamer said. “And I had never really thought about journalism as a male-dominated field before but I was like, wow, okay. There are a ton of older men in this field.” Opinion Editor and former State Politics and Government reporter at the Madison Capital Times Jessie Opoien agrees that the journalism field is still dominated by men. But, in her time at the Cap Times, Opoien said she has seen this start to change. “[Journalism] is absolutely a male-dominated field, as it has been traditionally, for a long time,” Opoien said. “But that being said, I work with a lot of really great women. And I think that I’ve seen that change. Even in the time that I’ve been doing this, which has only been like 10 years, but I do see a lot more younger women coming up and a lot of a lot of women kind of rising quickly into positions that are really prominent.”Barriers in 2020Though there has been this change, there are definitely less women in certain beats, Opoien said, particularly in state politics. Current State Politics and Government reporter at the Capital Times Briana Reilly echoed this, stating politics in general is still very male-dominated. Reilly said covering a beat that involves more men than women presents a challenge for her, as she can see how there are advantages to being a man covering the Capitol building. “But I think, given the fact that the legislature is pretty male-dominated as well, I think there could be an advantage to being a man covering the building in the sense that there might be more of a willingness to, you know, chat with another man … so I wouldn’t say that I’m at a disadvantage,” Reilly said. “But, I would say that I felt the need to be working constantly so that I can do the best that I can under whatever circumstances I’m in.”Reilly said she also approaches interviewing and networking differently as a woman than she has seen her male colleagues do, making sure to draw strict lines between what is work-related and what is more friendly. Opoien agreed with this, emphasizing how important it is to let sources know meetings are strictly work-related, as networking meetings can get “too personal.”“Often you know, you might be at a networking meeting or a source meeting having drinks, and it ends up getting, like way more personal than you expected them to be,” Opoien said. “There is definitely a difference in that experience and the [male journalists] that I talk to are usually really surprised to hear about the stuff that’s pretty commonplace for women.”Hamer often reports on criminal justice, and has had similar experiences with inmates crossing the line and getting too personal with her. She also added that sometimes it seems men don’t take female reporters as seriously as male reporters. But, Hamer said she has been in many circumstances where it seems sources feel better talking to her because she is a woman. “So I feel like sometimes sources can be more comfortable with women and be more vulnerable with women and that’s an advantage,” Hamer said. “But having to worry about getting hit on is not ideal.” Sexual harassment is also commonplace in journalism for women, McGarr said. According to the International Women’s Media Foundation, 70% of female journalists experience more than one type of harassment, threat or attack in the past, and 52% have experienced an offense within the past year.Reilly said the amount of sexism and sexual harassment she has heard of in the journalism industry really surprised her, and often female journalists don’t know how to handle it.McGarr added that this harassment has only gotten worse in the digital age, with journalists being more available on social media.“I think one of the main differences in the experience of women and men journalists is how they get treated by readers and colleagues,” McGarr said. “And you get a lot more slack, especially online on Twitter, for being a woman journalist. That was something I never had to deal with, but I know that it is an experience that is very common.”An Important AngleDespite the obstacles for female journalists, Opoien said, it is still extremely important for women to go into the journalism field, as they bring a unique angle to stories that men don’t.“As a woman in journalism, I think a lot about how to maximize the diversity of my sources and make sure that I’m talking to women and I’m talking to people of color and people who look like the population of our community,” Opoien said. “And I think that’s probably something that is more thought of by women and by journalists of color, and by people who aren’t used to seeing themselves represented in the media.”Cawley agreed with Opoien in that women allow for more inclusive stories to be told, but having women in the workforce is only a small step for a completely equal playing field.“I think having [women in journalism] shows that progress is being made. But more progress needs to happen,” Cawley said.","A [fe]male-dominated field: While more women continue to go into journalism, barriers still present",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2017/03/28/feelings-of-displacement-among-native-americans-extends-to-campus/,"Mar 28, 2017","Displacement has characterized the Native American experience for hundreds of years. This threat extends beyond the reservation, however, as University of Wisconsin-Madison students are still impacted by a lack of university support and a need for deeper community understanding.As a freshman, Faith Bowman walked miles across campus without catching sight of another brown person. Left wondering where other Native Americans were hiding at a university built on Ho-Chunk land, Bowman said without a community she felt lost.“Native students have been displaced for far too long,” Bowman said. “Both historically and just on this campus.”Coming from Milwaukee, Bowman said she was able to assimilate to college more easily than other Native American students who come from small towns or reservations, but she still struggled to find a home on campus. Bowman’s mother is a part of the Stockbridge-Munsee community and Bowman is considered a descendant who was born on the reservation but raised in the city. It was not until the second semester of Bowman’s freshman year that a non-Native graduate student told her about Wunk Sheek, one of UW-Madison’s Native American student organizations, and Bowman found a community.Bobbi Skenandore, a UW-Madison alumna from Chicago who is a member of Oneida Nation in Wisconsin, had a similar experience. She said as a student unaffiliated with any of UW-Madison’s scholarship programs, she came to campus not knowing what resources were available to her. After her first semester, she wondered if UW-Madison was the right decision, but met another Native student second semester who helped her get involved in Alpha Pi Omega, UW-Madison’s Native American sorority.While finding the Native American community on campus makes student life easier, miseducation about and disrespect toward Native American culture can make four years at UW-Madison difficult.Recruitment and retentionThe summer before her freshman year, Bowman’s mother wanted her to consider attending UW-Milwaukee instead of UW-Madison, so she convinced Bowman to attend the other university’s orientation. Bowman said there was a stark difference between UW-Milwaukee’s orientation and the UW-Madison orientation she went to a week later. At UW-Milwaukee, an adviser pulled Bowman aside to show her all of the Native American resources on campus and encouraged Bowman to call her “aunty.”“For students like me, there is that serious concern of if they will find their place on campus and if they will feel welcome to a point that they will graduate.”
Bobbi SkenandoreNichole Boyd, who took the position, said it is difficult to meet the needs of more than 400 undergraduate and graduate Native American students without support.At the beginning of each semester, Boyd receives a list of everyone who identified as Native American during their application process and sends out a welcome email with about two pages of information on resources and organizations that could be helpful to Native American students.“I’m an office of one so I’m still trying to work and navigate how to best access students and really figure out what they need and how I can make that work at a school that has [more than 40,000] students,” Boyd said.KATIE COONEY/The Badger HeraldBoyd said the two main programs UW-Madison uses to recruit Native American students are the Pre–College Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence and the Information Technology Academy-Tribal Technological Institute. While not exclusively for Native Americans, PEOPLE helps prepare students in disadvantaged Wisconsin communities for college through tutoring and mentoring.ITA-TTI teaches students how to use technology to tell their tribal stories in the Lac du Flambeau and Oneida communities. The programs aim to bridge the achievement gap and close the digital divide by working with Native American students.Drum beats filled the Field House for the 2015 Spring Powwow

It draws Native American students across the state to show them how they can pursue professions in the medical field.“It’s a way to introduce students to campus and to help instill that is something that’s attainable for them — they can go to college,” Boyd said.Skenandore said students coming through these programs are well-connected and know what resources are available to them, but for unaffiliated students she fears it can be too hard to transition.“For students like me, there is that serious concern of if they will find their place on campus and if they will feel welcome to a point that they will graduate,” Skenandore said.“Walking in two worlds” as a Native American studentRichard Monette, UW-Madison law professor and director of the Great Lakes Indian Law Center, grew up on Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota with a mother who passed away when he was 8 years old and a father with a drinking problem. He said going to grade school was a way to ensure he ate two meals a day.He received degrees from Mayville State College in North Dakota, University of North Dakota, University of Oregon and UW-Madison before becoming a law professor. He described his extensive higher education experience as “walking in two worlds.”“Whether it’s an academic adviser or a certain TA or teacher or somebody in the financial aid department, any familiar face [new students] can see on campus just to say hello during a passing period. [They are] little things that make college livable.”
Nichole BoydMonette said not all Native American students at UW-Madison face the same dilemmas. He said when it comes to the transition, the class load is often not the most challenging part, rather it is dealing with the cultural divide. He said there are some divides in cultural values that can be overwhelming and negatively impact their ability as students.Bowman called Boyd the “aunty” of campus because she works to make herself available to all Native American students, but she said Boyd needs more help.How UW linguists are helping keep Native American languages alive

Boyd said Native American culture sees everyone as an aunty, uncle, cousin, sister or brother — the family goes far beyond biological makeup.“Whether it’s an academic adviser or a certain TA or teacher or somebody in the financial aid department, any familiar face [new students] can see on campus just to say hello during a passing period,” Boyd said. “[They are] little things that make college livable.”Campus climateLast March, stereotypical war chants interrupted a Native American student sexual assault healing ceremony at Dejope Residence Hall, a building whose name is derived from the Ho-Chunk language. According to the 2015 UW American Association of Universities Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault Climate Survey, 46 percent of Native American and Alaska Native female undergraduate students reported being sexually assaulted.47 percent of female Native American UW students reported being sexually assaulted
Students, faculty, community members and elders of Wisconsin’s Native Tribes gathered Wednesday night around a “community healing circle” to raise awareness of Read…Bowman said after the incident at Dejope, a lot of Native American students did not feel safe and started coordinating to walk in groups when traveling on campus. She said the location of the incident, a residence hall with Native American roots, was especially disturbing.“The fact that students in that dorm did that is really terrifying because that should be the one dorm on campus [where] everybody knows the importance of the Native community,” Bowman said. “They literally have a fire pit with all the seals of the Native community on it so it … just really [felt] like this university doesn’t care about us.”“College shouldn’t damage you — college should teach you some things but it should also lead you to a better experience.”
Nichole BoydBoyd said the incident was a continuation of historical trauma and just one of the more overt aggressions Native American students and faculty face everyday.Boyd said sometimes she will start a lecture with the joke, “Hey, sorry I forgot my buckskin and feathers today but I promise you I … grew up in the Chicago Native community.” She does so because there is a stereotype associated with Native American culture that her appearance may not fit, but she does not want it to discredit her knowledge on the topic.On the other hand, Boyd said if a professor recognizes a student is Native American, they often single them out as an expert on their culture even though they are still students.At times it can feel like Native American students are just recruited to meet a cap and the university is not particularly concerned about retention, Bowman said. Reaching higher education in Native communities does not happen often so the students who do become role models.

While they want to encourage other students in their communities to attend UW-Madison, it’s difficult to recommend it when they are dealing with these conditions, Bowman said.Boyd said it is necessary to create a safer environment for Native students so communities want to send their children to UW-Madison.“College shouldn’t damage you — college should teach you some things but it should also lead you to a better experience,” Boyd said. “You should be able to go back to your community and say, ‘Yes, you should go to UW-Madison for all these fantastic reasons,’ and I’m just not quite sure that our students of color, if you’re listening to what they’re saying, are able to go back to their communities and say that wholeheartedly.”",Feelings of displacement among Native Americans extends to campus,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2017/01/17/state-sen-steve-nass-clearly-in-need-of-a-course-on-whiteness-masculinity/,"Jan 17, 2017","Sen. Steve Nass, R-Whitewater, has been on a tear against the University of Wisconsin’s “liberal agenda” recently.First, in late December, he attacked a UW class called “The Problem of Whiteness” by inserting his own whitewashed view of the world, calling on fellow Republican representatives to reform UW and to explain “why [the taxpayer’s] money is being wasted to advance the politically correct agenda of liberal administrators and staff.”Second, in early January, Nass felt his own masculinity was under attack from a six-week voluntary discussion program put on by UW’s own Men’s Project. The program aims to “explore masculinity and the problems accompanied by simplified definitions of it.” Apparently, this hurt Nass so deeply that he had to say the course “declares a war on men.”Nass is wrong about these offerings on all counts — that “The Problem of Whiteness” is unnecessary and that there is some “war” against men at this university.It should be clear why “The Problem of Whiteness” is offered.Last year, for those who live under a rock like Nass, was a time of great racial upheaval at UW, centering around a social media campaign #TheRealUW, where marginalized students shared their experiences of daily acts of racism and bigotry at UW. To address this completely obvious problem, UW officials shifted resources to classes aimed at confronting ingrained biases. You can debate whether these reforms did too much or not enough, but there is no question that reforms were necessary.Confronting #TheRealUW: Marginalized students reveal experiences of an unwelcoming campus
Launa Owens, a 19-year-old black freshman at University of Wisconsin, woke up slightly late for class Thursday morning in her Read…Frankly, it seems obtuse that Nass objects to this specific class when the only thing truly controversial about it is its title, which is based on a Richard Wright quote. The class’s main focus isn’t even on the United States. The course description states, “Our class will break away from the standard US-centric frame, and consider how whiteness is constructed globally, with particular attention to paradigmatic cases like South Africa.”It’s as if Nass saw the title and immediately got offended, tuned out reason and resorted to complaining about the plight of the white man, a view which a course like “The Problem of Whiteness” would challenge.Again, the context kills Nass’s argument when it comes to the reason why the Men’s Project is offering this six-week program exploring masculinity with one goal being to “ultimately prevent future violence by teaching participants to recognize warning signs of unhealthy interactions.”Voices of UW: ‘These stories are critical in describing what it really feels like to be a marginalized student on UW’s campus’
In light of recent events of hate and bias on the University of Wisconsin campus, students have been using #TheRealUW Read…The most notable occurrence at UW, gaining national attention this past semester, was the arrest of Alec Cook, who currently faces a 21-count criminal complaint from 10 women.This case is interwoven with UW’s ugly history of dealing with sexual assault and protecting and offering support to its female students. UW is still under federal Title IX investigation for its handling of sexual assault cases — our university is fourth in the nation for number of federal sexual assault probes. More impressive and sad is the fact that more than one in four women at UW reported they were sexually assaulted according to a survey from the Association of American Universities.Cook to be released on reduced $100,000 cash bail

Exploring what manhood means, higher usage of drugs and alcohol among men and encouraging healthier expressions of masculinity will ultimately help to lower the number of sexual assaults on campus. And if nothing else, this program isn’t a war against men but an attempt to understand and accept each man as the individual he is.The main problem with Nass is he’s proposing to go backward when all signs indicate we need to move forward, deal with our problems and become a better university.Aaron Reilly (areilly@badgerherald.com) is a sophomore majoring in social work and economics.","State Sen.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2019/03/12/uhs-womens-health-clinic-director-discusses-efforts-for-increased-access-to-reproductive-healthcare/,"Mar 12, 2019","The Student Alliance for Reproductive Justice invited Mary Landry to speak at their meeting Tuesday evening on the reproductive healthcare offered at University Health Services.Landry is the director of the Women’s Health Clinic at UHS and has worked as an OBGYN there since 2005. She discussed some of the historical challenges in providing reproductive healthcare to University of Wisconsin students and elaborated on the unique solutions her department has engineered.One of the challenges Landry found was the disparity in waiting periods for appointments addressing different health concerns at UHS. She said things like colds and sore throats are often treated on a same-day basis, but matters like preventive contraception needs are assigned long waiting periods. This has transformed under Landry’s direction in the last five years.“We as a broader community and as a nation make women wait to talk about what they need related to contraception,” Landry said. “What we’ve brought into women’s and sexual health is the same open-access idea that exists in the primary care clinic.”ASM discusses campaign for increased mental health services
University of Wisconsin’s Associated Students of Madison Student Council met Wednesday to discuss the University Health Services budget which was Read…One of the obstacles to providing same-day care is the rising demand that does not come with an equivalent rise in the number of providers. Landry referenced budgetary constraints, mentioning that the recent increased demand for mental health services has left women’s and sexual health on a lower priority level for increasing staff numbers.In 2016, Landry recognized an increasing demand for long-term contraception options like the IUD and the arm implant. She attributed this partially to the reproductive health anxiety that many felt upon the arrival of President Donald Trump’s administration.This influx in patients led to innovation in the way patients received care. The Women’s Health Clinic at UHS adopted an electronic consultation system that provides all of the necessary information about contraceptive procedures to patients. This renders an in-person consultation unnecessary, saving students time and freeing up care providers for more essential services.“We were poised and ready to meet the increased volume when Trump was elected and everyone was afraid that we were going to lose contraception access,” Landry said.Stigmas surrounding STIs hinder conversations about sexual health
Heather* had recently broken up with her partner when she began experiencing painful symptoms in her vaginal region, to the Read…Students fund many UHS services with segregated fees, which Landry sees as a huge benefit to access. She explained that traditional billing model clinics that rely on insurance for funding are able to innovate far less in their approaches to care, and often have more barriers to access.While IUD insertion procedures are not free, Landry believes that the women’s health department has a strong grasp on navigating insurance paperwork with their patients. Difficulties with insurance can be a barrier to access, but she says that the electronic consultation system has helped to shrink the gap.“We’ve doubled our IUD insertion numbers and tripled our IUD consults,” Landry said. “Single-visit IUD insertion is revolutionary. On a national level, it’s the right thing to do, but it’s hard to implement. You need a system that is committed to doing it.”The Women’s Health Clinic has also increased the accessibility of other forms of birth control through the implementation of ‘telehealth’ contraception, which allows patients to input health data electronically and then consult care providers by phone call to set up a prescription. ‘Telehealth’ has increased the clinic’s capacity and has received a flood of positive reviews from patients, according to Landry.In addition to oral contraception and long-term methods, the clinic has been involved in efforts to increase access to emergency contraception. Last year, Landry requested $4,000 in funding for emergency contraception for students who had experienced sexual assault.Evers’ dedication to women’s health an important step in reversing dangerous Walker policies

Over the last 10 years, there have been 22,191 cases of sex trafficking in the U.S. — and those are just the cases that were reported.

The report filed with CSO said members were supposed to tap the casket “with a small hammer,” but that an intoxicated student “stomped on the head area of the casket,” sending the student inside to the hospital with head injuries.UW’s statement announcing the CSO decision said the student got a concussion.The report filed with CSO said new members were also “fed things like oatmeal or cottage cheese with wasabi mixed in,” forced to sleep in the Chi Phi house’s attic and could not leave without an active member.CSO found the fraternity had violated four of 12 items on the Registered Student Organization code of conduct list, three of which prohibit acts of violence, endangerment, sexual assault and substance abuse.The decision is based off the January report and interviews that the Dean of Students’ office conducted.Hazing is reported occasionally, but only rarely confirmed, CSO chair Eric Knueve, the assistant dean of UW’s Center for Leadership and Involvement said.The Chi Phi chapter’s president, Sam Ferdig, and the executive director of the national organization have not responded to requests for comment.

This occurs most commonly when a lifelike appearance of artificial intelligence is sought after but not attained, according to Spectrum.Leslie Bow, a professor of Asian-American studies at the University of Wisconsin, spends her time conducting research within the uncanny valley. Bow is discovering how artificial intelligence has begun to embody stereotypes of Asian women seen in popular culture.“The saturation of Asianized gynoids in popular culture dovetails with actual robots who take the form of young, attractive Asian women,” Bow said.  Bow has asked why society must imagine AI as having any sort of physical, human-like form when AI at its core is just machinery.As AI programs proliferate, researchers investigate implications of machine-driven decisions

The anxiety that AI could represent a superior, more powerful being is offset by this stereotype of Asian women.”Bow believes stereotypical stories surrounding Asian women are also expressed when AI bears their resemblance. Asian women are depicted as continually in need of rescue, Bow said.The narratives being told derive from the number of Asian women and children involved in human trafficking or sex slavery, Bow said.“Fantasies of female embodied AI, clones or cyborgs enable two seemingly contradictory pleasures: Witnessing exploitation, imagined as sexual assault, and witnessing its transcendence, imagined as rescue,” Bow said.The #MeToo movement has encouraged sexual assault survivors to show solidarity with one another. In light of the #MeToo movement, women have asked that Siri be programmed to push back against sexual harassment, Bow said.Made to be like us: Using robots to enhance human interactions

People have the opportunity to disregard the stereotypes presented on a day to day basis, while still being able to increase the complexity of our interactions with robots and other types of artificial intelligence.“Whatever you’d expect from me if two of us were doing something together, expect that from a robot of the future,” Lumelsky said.","AI embodies stereotypes with real consequences, UW professor says",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2017/12/12/proud-boys-emblematic-of-rampant-misogyny-in-america/,"Dec 12, 2017","The height of the 2016 presidential election was a time of intense political polarization. It was a time where a presidential candidate had apparent free will to claim it was okay to grab women by the pussy because he was famous. It was a time where a years-old email scandal overshadowed sexual assault allegations. It was also when the Proud Boys was founded by conservative online talk-show host Gavin McInnes. The group metastasized in Wisconsin in May of this year, when eight men sat down at a bar in Milwaukee and established a new chapter celebrating their masculinity. Estimated to have about 5,000 members nationwide, Proud Boys believes that there are ten ways to fix America: Abolish prisons, give each American a gun, legalize drugs, end welfare, close borders to illegal immigrants, outlaw censorship, venerate the housewife, glorify the entrepreneur, shut down the government and declare the “West is best”.  In a perverse dichotomy, the Proud Boys simultaneously believe that there is a war on masculinity that starts from the time boys are young and continues throughout their lives, while also holding that men have the power and means to “create the modern world” and will not apologize for doing so.While the entirety of the ten “fixes” for America proposed by the Proud Boys is problematic, their attack on women raises questions in a society that already marginalizes and objectifies female bodies, minds, and capabilities. A female reporter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel was asked by a Proud Boys member if he should bring condoms to the interview. McInnes told a female reporter in a later interview that she should give up her job and focus on becoming pregnant, as her eggs weren’t going to last forever.It’s time to face your fear of feminism

I demand myself and all women start standing up to men like McInnes, Trump and all other men who believe women are somehow lesser than them.“Venerating the housewife”, one of the Proud Boys “ten commandments” is code for a reversal of feminist movements that have tirelessly worked to get women into the professional workforce, to break the age-old rhetoric that women are meant to clean, care for kids and put a hot dinner on the table for their husband to come home to. As it stands today, Congress is comprised of 80 percent men. All ten of the highest paid CEOs are men. In 2017, women are still earning only 80 cents to every dollar men earn for doing the same job.Ivanka Trump is about as much of a feminist as her father

Progress starts when men like McInnes get it through their heads that they are not victims of some tirade of oppression. White men hold unfathomable amounts of power and have systematically used it to work towards stripping women of bodily autonomy, access to equal pay and other rights that, were taken away from men, would be unthinkable. While not all men use their power to oppress, it is important for society to recognize that some do and that those men enact detrimental policies and social norms that are constantly are affecting women.Proud Boys is one of many manifestations of men who refuse to acknowledge that masculinity and the patriarchy can and do have negative connotations and consequences for this country. Trying to champion this ridiculous notion that “West is best” by excluding half of the population from the narrative is counterintuitive and serves as yet another reminder that, until women gain more representation and are given a serious platform to enact change, male-dominated politics and norms will continue to dominate society.

The various art pieces within the installation were removed from Humanities by the university, but the inclusion of them in this exhibit further highlights their overall importance.Other art pieces displayed various movements on campus during the presidential election and the months that followed. Among these were photographs and drawings of activism concerning President Donald Trump’s election and the Women’s March on Madison. Such documentation serves as not only proof of the issue at hand, but also as a reminder it is still important to continue voicing concern.A prevalent form of expression included the use of comics to bring attention to societal issues. The use of comics is beneficial to all involved — it creates a conversational environment with a great sense of relatability between the scenario and viewer.One piece targeted the necessity to reform sexual education, including multiple stages youth endure while being taught sex-ed. The issue at hand is the overall lack of adequate information given to students.Another comic dealt with presidential problems some believe occur more often than they should. “Donald Trump Problems” shows his character from an unfavorable point of view and depicts him as self-concerned and unprepared to lead the country.MORGAN GRUNOW/The Badger HeraldPowerful messages were also shown within the pieces dedicated to immigration concerns. Some pieces showcased statements from those fearing the possibility of leaving the country, while others dealt with various drawings fighting for respect for non-native’s existence. Overall, the concern for immigration was prevalent within the exhibit, mirroring the same concern, or sometimes lack thereof, in society itself.Issues concerning women’s rights also occurred quite frequently within the exhibit. Several pieces showed the fight for feminine power within the country and the lack of power women have over their bodies. With much upset about the female body becoming a “political battleground,” the various art pieces concerning this topic sent powerful messages.MORGAN GRUNOW/The Badger HeraldIn the center of the gallery, viewers became part of the exhibit, facing concerns on climate change.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2020/02/04/a-checkered-past/,"Feb 4, 2020","When the external review team of the University of Wisconsin fraternities and sororities released their report following their spring 2019 interviews, meetings and investigations into the community’s culture, the group found a particularly curious cause for the cracked foundations many UW Greek organizations rest on.“Among many student affairs staff members there exists a sense that the fraternity/sorority students ‘belong’ to [Fraternity and Sorority Life] alone,” the report reads. “One staff member problematically referred to them as ‘their [FSL] students’ — specifically implying they were not hers.”Crooked on the Northeast corner of the UW’s campus, Langdon Street sometimes appears to be a natural artery from the figurative heart of campus, Memorial Union. In recent history, though, a discrepancy in the perception between what is and is not considered a part of campus when it comes to Greek Life has risen to the forefront and created a sometimes divisive relationship between the university and Greek organizations. As Associate Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Mark Guthier sees it, the tension that rises in this relationship isn’t exactly hidden.“We are focused on deepening both the university’s, and [the Greek] community’s commitment to building and sustaining a healthier relationship,” Guthier said. “I think it’s well-known there have been challenges in this area.” For current UW undergraduates, it’s not surprising to see the university acknowledge this disconnect between itself and organizations in the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Association, Multicultural Greek Council and National Pan-Hellenic Council. In the Big Ten Conference, known for relatively active Greek Life communities in addition to academic and athletic excellence, UW’s community seems thin. According to US News and World Report, only 8% of students participate in Greek Life at UW — UW officially reports 14% of students are involved in Greek organizations — a statistic which ranks dead last out of all reported Big Ten figures. For many UW students, it is possible to have an undergraduate experience completely devoid of the Greek community.Seemingly annual reports relating increased health and safety risks to members of Greek organizations, coupled with these comparatively low involvement numbers, further spells trouble for UW’s Greek community. Released in February 2019, “The Color of Drinking” report found fraternity and sorority houses and Langdon Street in general as the two most-reported drinking sites for UW students — by over 20% more than the next-highest reported site. At present, five fraternities have been fully terminated in relationship to UW, with two more either suspended or on probation. Negative perceptions of Greek life continue to creep into student conversations on Madison streets and online. The disconnect in the relationship between Langdon’s houses and the university-at-large can seem like a byproduct of the modern era. Increased attention to sexual assault and drinking risks in studies like “The Color of Drinking” and the AAU Campus Climate Survey appear to put more and more heat on these long-standing UW communities. With all the headlines, however, comes a history.Autonomy from National, campus One of the first issues of autonomy Greek organizations faced on UW’s campus put more than a decade’s worth of UW students in a contentious fight supporting discrimination clauses. Until 1961, various Greek organizations on UW’s campus restricted membership based on racial, ethnic or religious grounds. These clauses included Sigma Chi’s restriction of membership to only “bona-fide white” males.While the timeline seems quite delayed for eliminating these clearly discriminatory provisions, UW was one of the first universities nationwide to be entirely rid of the clauses in all of its organizations. Yet the Human Rights Committee, which was primarily composed of faculty, ultimately pushed these clauses to extinction rather than intent of the organizations themselves. For example, then-President of UW Sigma Chi Richard Urfer drafted a report calling for the elimination of a strict 1960 deadline to remove clauses like those found in the chapter’s constitution. A few months later, he went with other members of the chapter to fight for the removal of said clauses. This report, like many other pieces of evidence from this tension, can be found in the UW Archives in Steenbock Library.Once removed, additional worries of true autonomy bubbled to the surface. A nearby case, where the national organization of Delta Gamma suspended its Beloit College chapter after it tried to pledge an African-American student, made the faculty Human Rights Committee question whether UW organizations could actually pledge members of color. Due to these fears, the Board of Regents recommended to terminate the Delta Gamma chapter at UW shortly thereafter.In an oral history conducted in 1975, former dean of students Leroy E. Luberg said over 1,000 members of the local chapters marched to his office in Bascom Hall to say that they “were free, they were open, they were nondiscriminatory, and we at the University should be strong enough and broadminded enough to allow them to continue.”  The chapter was allowed to stay on campus, but the tone had shifted. The minutes of a following IFC meeting noted the community’s want for “faculty help, not faculty dictation” in confronting these issues facing the chapters. The archives themselves also support signs of a rift at this particular moment in the community’s history, as the university only holds records of meeting minutes until early 1964. In the following decades, newsmaking incidents repeatedly suggested a disconnect between the university and the Greek community. In the late 1980s, a series of racially-charged events, including a Zeta Beta Tau “slave auction” conspicuously parodying famous African-American personalities and a “Harlem” room at a party featuring watermelon jugs, brought questions of the relationship between the Greek community and the university as a whole back into focus. In Zeta Beta Tau’s case, for example, a student-led committee determined no action could be taken against the fraternity’s “slave auction,” given the display lied within the scope of the first amendment. But the Wisconsin Student Association, a previous iteration of student government, proclaimed Zeta Beta Tau “had no place on campus.” With this backdrop, then-Chancellor Donna Shalala created The Commission on the Future of Fraternities and Sororities to examine the community and its relationship to the university as a whole.School of Journalism and Mass Communication Professor Emeritus James Hoyt led the commission comprised of faculty, staff, alumni and students, making the commission widely called the “Hoyt Commission.” Hoyt said in a feature in the 1993 edition of the Badger Yearbook that the Greek community at the time was very unorganized and lacked oversight from the broader university.“We discovered the IFC was a very ineffective, rag-tag organization,” Hoyt said. “No one knew if they had a constitution.” Following this commission, the IFC and other Greek governing bodies became restrengthened as the commission effectively let the Greek communities govern themselves. Then-IFC President Dennis Lesak said in the same feature this was “different from other campuses,” where the university has more direct involvement in the governance of its Greek organizations.Concerns throughout campusOnce again, UW turns its eye eastward to Langdon Street with the UW Fraternity and Sorority Life External Review. With this past as prologue, the reasoning for the wide-ranging external review becomes clearer. One can begin to understand why the second article of the IFC’s bylaws denote the organization as “self-governing,” and pushed away from strict university dictation. Early last spring, the vice chancellor charged the group with the purpose of “assessing, clarifying, and strengthening the relationship between the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the fraternity and sorority community.” As the review worked on identifying the tensions in this relationship, familiar issues yet again rose to the surface.In the August 2019 report, the external review team described an issue of autonomy in decision-making between the Committee on Student Organizations, the Office of Student Conduct and the councils, which they termed as a “jurisdictional challenge.” Created in 1996, after the events and determinations of the Hoyt Commission, the Committee on Student Organization’s purposes are to keep registered student organizations in compliance with established policies and discipline organizations if these policies are broken. While proximal in development of the Hoyt Commission, the creation of this committee was a departure from the self-governance solution. This committee, along with the chapter judicial boards, national headquarters and the Governing Council, leaves all Greek organizations under four layers of jurisdiction, each with their own requirements.Noted in the external review’s report, concerns about the sense of a judicial bureaucracy with these competing jurisdictional bodies made several IFC openly contemplate the possibilities of a Greek community adjacent yet dissociated from campus. These dreams of a completely autonomous, “underground” system seems like a typical want for UW’s Greek communities when put in historical context, but most Greek-affiliated students never learn of this history. Tim Nielsen, junior member of Delta Tau Delta, had never heard of this community history before.“At least in my experience, history of Greek life as a whole at this university is not really focused on,” Nielsen said. “The history of specific chapters at the university and nationally is, but as far as the community as a whole and its history, I don’t think there’s any formal education.”Of course, this want for autonomy was not the only aspect of the historical UW Greek experience reiterated in the external review. Students of color interviewed for the review, both involved in Greek organizations and unaffiliated, routinely described Langdon Street as a place where they did not feel safe. Additionally, members of MGC and NPHC organizations felt marginalized as their organizations never received praise for the good they were doing in the community, and yet all Greeks were scolded whenever any chapter engaged in detrimental behaviors. These findings led the team to recommend the university “place singular focus and attention on UW’s history, structures, policy and practices and how they lead to or inhibit the recruitment, retention, and belonging of students, faculty, and staff of color.”When the vice chancellor released the action plan in August, Greek leaders said they were optimistic for progress in a UW news article. Gloria Wide, president of the MGC, felt this indicated a university commitment towards the entire Greek community and allows for members in the community to share their voices to evoke change in their communities. “I’m optimistic because there are so many of us dedicated to working on the system — to do better and to be better,” Wide said.Communities in collaborationThese action plans are just getting started. Two new work groups inspired by the external review team’s suggestions have come to fruition since the report’s release last August. The Langdon Street Community Coalition, consisting of fraternity and sorority members, advisors and other stakeholders involved with student organizations, is focused on addressing broad concerns which have in the past added tension in the community’s relationship to the university, including group climate and risk reduction. Another work group includes student members from the MGC and NPHC and is focused on drafting tangible action plans to address the five priority areas in the institution’s response to the report.“Since the fraternity and sorority life review was completed in August, we’ve had seven listening sessions with several constituent groups, including the Langdon Area Community Coalition and the four councils that govern the nearly 60 chapters in this community,” Guthier said. “The response was very positive, and the sessions allowed us to get important feedback and agreements on our priority areas.”These key priorities neglect to specifically include community-wide education on the history of UW’s Greek organizations, leaving the question of whether the community can broadly learn from its past tensions up in the air. With many forces joining together this time, there is hope a collaborative can change the community’s narrative going forward.“I think it’s important to emphasize that we are doing this work in community,” Guthier said. “It has been a very collaborative process among students in fraternity and sorority life, the governing councils [IFC, PHA, NPHC and MGC], alumni, house corps members, advisors, university staff and Madison community members. Each of the priority areas are connected, so this work isn’t being done in silos.” Guthier added that progress from these newly-formed groups should become available throughout the current semester.In the Greek community, these new groups do not come tarnished with a history of disagreements and tension, leaving an open relationship possible in their coming actions.“[The work groups are] relatively new, they haven’t really done things that I necessarily disagree with or completely agree with,” Nielsen said, “but I’m aware of their existence. They just haven’t really done much yet.”With work to be done, these plans have a chance to make the bonds between fraternity and sorority life and UW just as strong as the bonds between brothers and sisters.",A checkered past,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2013/11/08/letter-perpetuates-common-rape-culture-myths/,"Nov 8, 2013","Dear David Hookstead,I am writing you this letter regarding your letter in The Badger Herald, “Rape culture does not exist.” This letter is an attempt to initiate dialogue about rape culture.Your misguided quest to disprove the existence of rape culture actually confirms the reality of rape culture by perpetuating five primary rape culture myths, namely that rape is committed by “evil people,” that rape culture is a fiction created by feminists to demonize men, that blame for rape must be placed on victims, that women make false rape accusations and that rape is natural, inevitable and immutable. Your letter is a prime example of rape culture, and a glaring reminder of how we, as a society, fail to educate young men about rape.In addition, your letter evinces a fundamentally flawed understanding of what constitutes rape and rape culture. I will begin by defining rape and rape culture to clear up your misunderstandings. I will then move on to debunking the rape culture myths that your essay supports.Here is the definition of rape from the excellent campus organization, Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment, adapted from the legal definition of rape: “Rape is vaginal, anal and/or oral penetration without consent. Sexual assault is any sexual contact without consent. Consent is a free and clearly given yes, not the absence of a no, and cannot be received when a person is incapacitated by alcohol or drugs.” Here are some statistics that highlight the gruesome reality of rape culture in the United States: According to the Department of Justice, every two minutes someone in the U.S. is sexually assaulted. One in four girls, one in six boys, and almost half of transgender youth, are sexually assaulted before age 18, according to a study by David Finkelhor. One out of six college women have been raped or have been the victim of an attempted rape during the past year, according to the Department of Justice.Here is a basic definition of rape culture from Wikipedia: “Rape culture is a concept which links rape and sexual violence to the culture of a society, and in which prevalent attitudes and practices normalize, excuse, tolerate and even condone rape. Examples of behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include victim blaming, sexual objectification and trivializing rape.”Here are the five common rape culture myths that your essay perpetuates:1. Sexual assaults are committed by anonymous, amorphous “evil people.” In reality, 60-80 percent of all sexual assaults are committed by someone the victim knows and typically trusts (i.e. a relative, friend, neighbor or acquaintance). The people, mostly men, who commit rape are our colleagues, acquaintances, friends and family. Indeed, one out of 15 male students raped or attempted to rape a woman during the past year, according to a study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education. Describing rapists and rape as “evil” individualizes a social problem, effectively transforming the societal pandemic of sexual violence into a narrative of individual pathology. Essentialist statements about “evil” and “bad people” efface the cultural context in which rape takes place. Your evasive resignation of rape as an act of “evil” and “bad people,” is not only intellectually irresponsible and politically deleterious, it also profoundly disservices men by implying that they are all “naturally” predatory, rapacious beasts. This leads me to the next myth.2. Rape culture demonizes men. You write, “This term [rape culture] aggressively paints men as dangerous and as the root of evil.” In actuality, refuting the reality of rape culture demonizes men. When you argue that rape is a natural, albeit “evil” act, rather than a product of rape culture, you are essentially arguing that men, who do most of the raping in this country, are natural predators and latent rapists. You are arguing that they are inherently “evil” and “bad” (your own words) people who cannot control their natural inclination to rape. Contrary to popular belief, feminists believe men are better than that. We believe that men have the capacity for empathy and transformation.3. Blame for rape must be placed on victims. Minimal cultural examination reveals that victim-blaming is the blatant and unabashed status quo in our culture! The archetypal cultural response to rape in the U.S. is to protect rapists. The “accused” shame and blame the victims, the “accusers,” and vilify the people, especially feminists, who challenge rape culture. The questions we typically ask women survivors following their rape exposes our cultural penchant for victim-blaming. We ask women, “What were you wearing?” “Were you drinking?” “Why did you go back to his house?” etc., as if the victim’s clothing or behavior had any bearing on whether a rapist decided to rape her. The only determinant of whether someone will experience rape is the presence of a rapist. Our culture continues to place the onus rape prevention on women, instead of the people doing the raping, typically men. We tell women, “Don’t get raped!” and “Be careful!” instead of telling men, “Don’t rape!” and “Always ask for consent!” We give women inane sexual assault “prevention tips,” when the only prevention tip that could ever prevent rape is, “Don’t assault people!” Even the language we use to discuss rape embodies rape culture. When we describe victims as “accusers” and rapists as the “accused,” we insinuate that the victim wronged the rapist by “accusing” him, while the rapist, the “accused,” is the real victim.4. Women make “false rape accusations.” In reality, fewer than 5 percent of reported sexual assaults are false accusations. The myth that women lie about rape silences and stigmatizes survivors. Indeed, only 5 percent of undergraduate women report their sexual assault out of fear that people will blame them for their own rape or accuse them of making “false accusations,” according to a study by Schwartz and Leggett in “Violence Against Women.”5. Rape is inevitable. Your essay implies, if not outright argues, that rape is inevitable, anti-rape education is futile and that we should accept rape as a natural part of our cultural landscape. You flippantly dismiss anti-rape education with your statement, “You’ll often hear very uneducated people make statements like, ‘If people taught their sons not to rape women then we wouldn’t have a problem.’” This is not only an offensive, myopic and intellectually bankrupt response to the pandemic of sexual violence in this country, but this line of reasoning also demonstrates a stunning incapacity for empathy with survivors and potential victims of sexual violence. The article essentially tells women, and other folks who have or will suffer sexual violence, that rape is something they must endure. I refuse to accept this.Moreover, the entire premise of your essay, that, “rape culture does not exist,” is a myth that even the most cursory cultural examination debunks. We live in a culture where the number one song in the country, for months, was “Blurred Lines,” a song rightly described by critics as “rapey.” A popular 2013 Audi Super Bowl commercial depicted a man sexually assaulting a woman. After the recent Steubenville verdict, news reporters empathized with the rapists rather than the victims. The New York Times stipulated that an 11-year-old girl’s make-up and revealing clothing were to blame for her gang-rape, rather than the 18 men who gang-raped her. If you need more empirical evidence that rape culture exists, you need only consult your own Twitter feed and Facebook page, “UW-Madison Confessions.” Both are replete with examples of rape culture. On August third you tweeted, “Worst/Funniest pick up line I’ve ever heard: ‘How do I know we’re having sex later tonight? I’m stronger than you.’” UW-Madison Confessions frequently posts statuses such as, “Some hot chick sat next to me … swung her legs on me and covered us with a blanket … I’m safely going to assume you want a one-way ticket to pleasure town.”This, David Hookstead, is what rape culture looks like.Before you respond to this letter, I ask that you take time to self-reflect and self-educate on these issues. As a former TA for an introductory women’s studies class, I am accustomed to dealing with men who are hostile and resistant to feminism, if not downright antifeminist or misogynistic, but I am also familiar with the transformative potential that education, critical self-reflection and an understanding of privilege can have on these men. I hope you take my words to heart, because I believe in your capacity for empathy and transformation. After all, I am a feminist.I look forward to reading your reply.Kelly Fox (kfox2455@gmail.com) is a UW graduate. ",Letter perpetuates common rape culture myths,UWM

https://badgerherald.com/news/2009/03/04/alleged-rape-at-sigm/,"Mar 4, 2009","The Sigma Chi fraternity house, 221 Langdon St., is the alleged location of a sexual assault last October.[/media-credit]The Sigma Chi fraternity has placed itself on a form of social probation amid a controversial investigation into at least one sexual assault that allegedly took place at its Langdon Street house last October.The Badger Herald learned of the investigation last week when the victim of the alleged incident came forward and revealed the story of how she was drugged and raped, allegedly by several members of Sigma Chi.Detective Ann Turner of the Madison Police Department confirmed her office has been investigating the matter.Since the investigation is ongoing, Turner could not offer any more details, only saying the case will remain open until suspects are found or statutes of limitations apply.Though the victim has no recollection of the assault itself since she believes she was drugged, she said doctors who examined her the day after the incident believe due to the amount of tearing, several men “took turns” penetrating her.The victim, a University of Wisconsin student and a member of the Greek community, said she is pleased some action concerning the incident is being taken, but no punishment would remedy what happened to her.“Obviously [the probation] is something and I’m happy about it, but I personally think because they just recently raped someone that they should be kicked off campus,” she said.In a statement e-mailed to the Herald, Michael Dunn, executive director of the Sigma Chi International Fraternity, said his organization is taking the allegations very seriously and is cooperating with both UW and police.“While any statement is premature at this point, the alleged actions are inconsistent with the values of Sigma Chi,” Dunn wrote. “Pending a full investigation, we will take swift action to hold a member accountable for his actions should he be found responsible.”The victim said she decided to come forward to the Herald after an interaction at a bar with another woman who said she was raped at the Sigma Chi house.She added at the time of their conversation, the woman had yet to contact police or the Offices of the Dean of Students. After meeting the woman at the bar, the victim said she was so distraught she “almost threw up.”A friend of the victim, who also chose to remain anonymous, was present during the Herald’s interview for emotional support.She told a story of how she attended a party at the Sigma Chi house last spring and a member dropped a pill into her drink while she was looking away.She said she turned back quickly enough to see the pill dissolving and proceeded to pour out the drink and leave the room.Between these three alleged incidents, the victim’s friend said she is concerned sexual assault is common within Sigma Chi.“[I]t seems like it’s a problem within their house — not just an isolated person, not just an isolated incident,” the victim’s friend said. “Obviously, if I was roofied almost a year ago at their house and two people have been raped there since, and we’ve only had one person come forward with it, it seems like there’s obviously other people.”Though the victim’s friend never took any formal action against the member who allegedly dropped the pill in her drink, she said the incident concerns her because that individual is now on the Interfraternity Council’s executive board, which is the governing body for fraternities at UW.“[IFC is] kind of like the good ol’ boys network,” the victim’s friend said. “You know this person, I know that person, I’ve got your back. It just kind of suppresses all other outside voices for the good of just protecting each other.”The rape victim said she believes there is a tendency in the Greek community to not discuss or take action on sexual assault.“I feel like it diminishes me as a rape victim,” she said. “It’s saying, ‘Oh, you know what, that was something bad, but we don’t really care about it because it will ruin the Greek reputation.'”In an e-mail to the Herald, IFC President Nate Anderson said in cases such as these, IFC is not the entity that would investigate the allegations.The Greek Judicial Board, comprised of students, would hear the victim’s complaint should she choose to file one. Additionally, the victim could file the report partially anonymously, with only the chief justice and Greek advisors knowing her name.“The Interfraternity Council is disheartened and saddened by these allegations and hopes that if these allegations are substantiated, that those involved will be held accountable for their actions,” Anderson wrote.Anderson did not offer any further comment on the investigation itself.In a follow-up interview Monday, the victim said under no circumstances would she file a complaint unless there was a way for her to remain anonymous.Sigma Chi President Andrew Thalhimer declined to comment Tuesday beyond the statement made by Dunn.Susan Lorimor, spokesperson for Sigma Chi International Fraternity, said last week that individual chapters typically do not make comments to the press when asked about this kind of issue.Due to federal privacy laws, Dean of Students Lori Berquam could not comment directly on the case but said in all sexual assault cases, her office works closely with the victim and MPD.Related Stories: Victim comes forward, reveals shocking storyTranscript of Herald’s interview with rape victimCORRECTION: IFC President Nate Anderson’s name was spelled incorrectly.

https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2018/03/14/binge-drinking-poses-serious-health-risks-keep-spring-break-balanced/,"Mar 14, 2018","Every year in March, thousands of college students flock to Florida, Texas, Alabama, Mexico, the Bahamas and more for spring break. While break is different for everyone, a large number of students utilize spring break as a time to let loose and party for an entire week.Spring break serves as a reminder of the constant pressure college students face when it comes to drugs and alcohol, and ultimately represents colleges’ increasingly dangerous drinking culture. As a reminder, 80 percent of college students choose to drink alcohol in the U.S., and 50 percent of students that drink do so by binge drinking.Binge drinking can lead not only to regretful decisions and embarrassing behavior, but can often result in more serious consequences. A whopping 696,000 college students aged 18-24 are assaulted annually by another student who has been drinking, and 97,000 students aged 18-24 experience sexual assault or date rape as a result of alcohol every year. This number is most likely larger too since nearly 40 percent of sexual assaults in the U.S. go unreported each year.App designed by UW researchers proven to help overcome drug, alcohol addictions
A team of University of Wisconsin researchers have developed a mobile smartphone app proven to help individuals overcome drug and Read…So why do college students continue to drink? Well, the first major culprit is likely peer pressure. Especially at a large school like the University of Wisconsin, there are parties every weekend and the majority of students equate a fun time with alcohol consumption, sometimes with the accompaniment of drugs. For students who choose not to drink or do drugs, it can often be hard to find others who choose the same lifestyle and it can be even more difficult to find things to do on the weekends besides party.According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, “research shows that students who choose not to drink often do so because their parents discussed alcohol use and its adverse consequences with them.”In a college setting and during spring break, the absence of parents is likely one of the main causes of binge drinking, since students do not have their parents constantly concerned with where they are or what they’re doing, and students often feel the need to rebel and prove they can “be an adult.”There is not one right way to solve this problem, but it seems most universities resort to the same solution. UW instituted AlcoholEdu, an online course that educates students on the consequences of drinking, as a requirement for all first-year and transfer students. While this is a good start, it’s arguably what other universities have been doing for years and could use more of a shock factor when discussing the effects of binge drinking.Wisconsin in dire need of succinct, effective alcohol policy free from conflicts of interest
Start stockpiling beer folks. The price of a thirty rack is about to skyrocket.

While some consider this to be an accomplishment (and don’t get me wrong, it’s pretty cool), I feel this should be a wake-up call for the university that more needs to be done about the continuation of binge drinking.If you’re going somewhere for spring break, be safe and smart. UW continues to be a highly ranked school, but it’s no secret that the drinking culture here is a large part of student life. With spring break approaching, we are reminded that college students nationwide face pressure to binge drink, and it’s undeniable that colleges such as our own need to deal with drinking culture in more effective ways.Courtney Degen (cdegen@wisc.edu) is a freshman majoring in political science and intending to major in journalism.",Binge drinking poses serious health risks — keep spring break balanced,UWM

The yellow tier calls for more escalated action and carries the risk of citation and arrest. Choosing to be in the red tier, however, means you are planning to and are prepared to be arrested.Those in the red tier commit to continuing their piece of direct action against the pipeline until they are forced to stop by law enforcement.Delay, delay, delayActivist and senior at College of Saint Benedict in Minnesota Melissa Burrell has only gone as far as the yellow tier and is well aware of the consequences of going further.“There have now been over 200 people who have been arrested at these different spots with construction,” Burrell said.Direct action is a stalling technique that takes the form of non-violent protests at construction sites to delay the pipeline and generate as much media attention as possible in the process, Burrell said.Activists have chained themselves to construction equipment and crawled and hid inside of the pipes until law enforcement forced them out, Burrell said. She brought up one instance where activists managed to bring two massive pianos onto the construction site and played music for an entire morning.Recently, Indigenous water protectors from the Giniw Collective built and prayed inside a waaginogaaning, a traditional Anishinaabe structure they set up on the construction site, delaying construction for several hours.“All of these things are just to delay construction,” Burrell said. “The more hullabaloo that law enforcement has to go through to try and take someone out of a pipe or to take someone off of a piano, then that is taking a lot of time and equipment is obviously not able to run while that is happening.”A long history of controversyProtesting North America’s fossil fuel pipelines is nothing new. Oil was discovered in Canada in the 1850s and construction of pipelines followed soon after. For over a century, a network of trains, pipelines and ships have been transporting crude oil from the tar sands of Alberta, Canada down into the Midwest.Out of the 2.85 million barrels of oil Canada exports per day, a whopping 97% ends up in the U.S. Today there are over 840,000 kilometers of pipelines in Canada, but as far back as the 1970s, proposals to expand that network have often run up against Indigenous claims to land and environmental concerns.In the last decade, as concern over carbon emissions rise, oil pipelines have also come to represent a tangible and symbolic manifestation of climate change, becoming a major target for environmentalists.After nearly a decade of back and forth, environmentalists and Indigenous activists succeeded in getting the Biden administration to block the permit on the Keystone XL Pipeline. The fight surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline, however, is ongoing.Line 3, owned and operated by the multinational energy corporation Enbridge, starts in Alberta and cuts its way through North Dakota and Minnesota before ending in Superior, Wisconsin. Of the roughly 1,000 miles of pipeline, only 14 lie in the Badger State.Built in 1960, the Line 3 pipeline has aged significantly. Initially built to transport 760,000 barrels of oil per day, the pipeline has become corroded to the point where it can only support around half that capacity. For perspective, that is equivalent to a fifth of Canada’s daily oil export to the U.S. Replacing Line 3 would restore the pipeline to its historic capacity and reduce the need to transport crude oil by rail, Enbridge spokesperson Juli Kellner said in an email.Construction of the replaced Wisconsin section ended in 2017, and by December 2020, Enbridge finished the North Dakota section as well. The only unfinished portion is the 337-mile Minnesota segment, whose construction began as Enbridge wrapped up in North Dakota.Currently, Enbridge enjoys the support of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa governments, the two tribes whose territory the existing pipeline passes through.“Enbridge has demonstrated ongoing respect for tribal sovereignty. As the result of negotiations with tribal leadership, Line 3 was routed outside of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe Reservation and through the Reservation of the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa,” Enbridge said in their statement. “Both Leech Lake and Fond du Lac, the two tribes most affected by the project, support the replacement of Line 3 and have spoken and written repeatedly in support of project permits.”Oneida Nation of Wisconsin memeber and Indian Country editor Paul DeMain said there remains significant opposition to the pipelines within Indigenous communities. From DeMain’s perspective, Enbridge has bought the support they enjoy by spending big on public relations.“They’ve caused a huge disruption within tribal political structures by buying people and by bribing people, by pumping money into people and public relations to make it look like the public supports this when many of us believe that that’s a split decision,” DeMain said.Water, earth and airNelson Institute for Environmental Studies assistant professor and expert on grassroots, Indigenous-led engagements with industrial expansion Leah Horowitz said while it is true that our society needs oil at this moment to survive, the perils of climate change require a transition away from it. Choosing not to replace pipelines that need to be replaced is a way to create that transition, according to Horowitz.Concerns over climate change, oil spills and Indigenous sovereignty have mobilized a broad coalition in opposition to the project, which includes environmental groups like the Sierra Club and Minnesota 350, and Indigenous-led organizations like the Giniw Collective and Honor the Earth.In February, prominent progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., called on President Joe Biden’s administration to halt the project. Even the Minnesota Commerce Commission has stepped into the fray, joining several other parties in a legal challenge against the Minnesota Public Utility Commission which approved the pipeline’s permit.Sierra Club Wisconsin chapter director Elizabeth Ward said the carbon intensive mining and extraction process for tar sand oil adds significantly to the pipeline’s carbon footprint.Tar sands oil is very different from conventional oil. The Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit group of scientists, describes it as a mixture of sand, clay, water and bitumen — a thick oil-rich substance with the consistency of molasses. It is this bitumen from which gasoline and other oil products are made.While conventional crude oil extraction is accomplished by drilling into the ground and letting oil flow to the surface, tar sands are extracted through either open pit mining or steam extraction, according to an NPR infographic. Neither process is environmentally friendly.Mining tar sand oil requires tearing down swaths of Boreal forest to access the oil rich sand, Ward said. Canada’s boreal forest, Ward noted, is an even bigger carbon sink than the Amazon. Carbon sinks are natural reservoirs of carbon that store it and keep it out of the atmosphere. When tar sand deposits are more than 225 feet underground, companies extract them by pumping hot steam into the reserve. This process produces even more carbon emissions than open pit mining.According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a gallon of tar sands oil generates 15% more carbon emissions over its lifetime than a gallon of conventional oil. It is for these reasons that the Sierra Club characterizes tar sands oil as the world’s dirtiest oil.The project’s environmental impact statement found that the total carbon footprint over the pipeline’s lifetime would be 193 million tons per year in carbon emissions. By contrast, the total carbon footprint of all of Minnesota is 154 tons.In their statement, Enbridge said a continual demand for crude oil drives the pipeline’s emissions. The statement points to one of the PUC’s conclusions that blocking the pipeline would not impact the demand for crude oil, but would lead to riskier forms of transportation.“The record evidence does not support a conclusion that denial of the certificate of need will significantly reduce demand for crude oil,” the PUC said in their ruling. “Instead, the evidence establishes that the most likely result of denial will instead be increased transport of crude oil via more dangerous means such as rail, and continued use of the deteriorating Existing Line 3.”Still, transporting oil by rail is more expensive, costing $10 to $15 dollars per barrel compared to $5 per barrel for a pipeline. Tar sands oil is already more expensive to produce, and higher prices could dent demand.Environmentalists are also concerned about oil spills. Line 3 has already been the site of the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history. In March 1991, a rupture sent 1.7 million gallons gushing onto the frozen Prairie River in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, just two miles upstream from the Mississippi River. Had the Prairie River not been frozen, the contamination would have spread down to the Gulf of Mexico.There have also been recent spills. In 2010, over 840,000 gallons from Enbridge’s Line 6 spilled into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan.“Tar sands oil is really different from what we call traditional oil. Because of the nature of it, if left over time, it actually sinks to the bottom,” Ward said.Whereas traditional oil floats and can be cleaned using booms to take it off the top of a body of water, the oil from the Kalamazoo spill stuck to the riverbed like bubble gum, Ward said. The EPA decided that cleaning up the remaining 5% of the oil still in the riverbed and surrounding wetland area would cause more ecological damage than it would prevent.Contamination of the water supply is a concern for much of the Midwest, as the pipeline crosses 227 lakes and rivers, including the Mississippi River and a handful of rivers upstream of Lake Superior, Ward said.Taking it to courtThe Sierra Club is involved in two main avenues of litigation against Line 3, Ward said. In the first, the group has joined the Department of Commerce’s challenge to the PUC permit approving the pipeline.The challenge claims that Enbridge did not provide a long term demand forecast demonstrating the need for a new pipeline as the law requires them to do when applying for a permit from the PUC. Instead of providing a forecast for demand for crude oil from refineries, Enbridge used a forecast of supply from crude oil producers, claiming that increased oil production constituted an increased demand for pipeline space to transport the oil.The second lawsuit argues that the Army Corp of Engineers failed to complete a proper environmental impact assessment of Line 3 when it granted Enbridge a permit.Central to the issue is whether Line 3 is a replacement pipeline or a new pipeline entirely, since the route for the new Line 3 veers south from the original by around 50 miles in one segment. Whether or not the project is considered a replacement carries legal consequence, DeMain said. New pipelines require a complete environmental impact statement, while replacements do not.According to Vox, the Biden administration could halt the pipeline and make Enbridge reapply for a permit that takes local environment, Indigenous land rights and climate change more into account.Looking forwardBurrell said she hopes activism against Line 3 draws the attention of the Minnesota state legislature and the Biden administration.“The main tactics are delaying the physical construction, and then using that delay to create awareness, and then using that awareness to enact legal action against the pipeline,” Burrell said.DeMain credited activists with significantly driving up costs for Enbridge. In February, Enbridge was forced to add $1.1 billion to their estimated project cost, a total that included $200 million due to regulatory and financial carrying costs caused by delays.Still, in their statement, Enbridge said the protests have had little impact on the project, which remains on schedule to be completed by the end of this year.“We recognize the rights of individuals and groups to express their views legally and peacefully,” Kellner said in the statement. “We don’t tolerate illegal or dangerous protest activities of any kind.”Burrell said bail funds and legal defense funds exist for protesters who are cited and arrested.Though most of the activism against the Line 3 pipelines has taken place in Minnesota, last year Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers signed into law a bill making trespassing on oil company property a felony.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/03/28/meet-the-candidates-running-for-district-5s-county-board-seat/,"Mar 28, 2016","The student-dominated District 5 of the Dane County Board of Supervisors will be up for grabs April 5 — here’s a look at the two candidates vying for a spot on the board.Hayley Young, former president of College Democrats and University of Wisconsin alumna, will be facing off with Associated Students of Madison representative and fellow College Democrat, Angelito Tenorio. While there is significant overlap in the key issues they hope to address, Young is banking on her experience and detailed policy proposals while Tenorio said his discipline and multicultural perspective set him apart.As members of College Democrats, it’s no surprise both candidates are focusing primarily on social issues in their bid to replace incumbent Leland Pan, who is leaving county government. Both candidates said human services, lake pollution, racial inequity and sexual assault are core issues they would tackle as members of county government.Leaving county board, Leland Pan recalls career marked by idealism
After two terms serving a district of predominantly students, Dane County Supervisor Leland Pan, District 5, will leave county government Read…Here’s how the two differ:A 23-year-old and recent UW graduate, Young said she has a gained a wealth of experience from her time working as an activist within the community. From volunteering with Planned Parenthood to hosting a mayoral forum through College Democrats, Young said she has learned a great deal about collaborating with community organizations.Young said she has gained this experience because she has not had the luxury of explicit power available to ASM representatives. It is this ability to collaborate she hopes to bring to the County Board, Young said.“The reason I’m running is I’ve spent the last four years having the opportunity to engage in the community and I hope to bring that leadership to the Dane County Board,” she said.During her time as an activist, Young said she’s proud of her work to better engage students and the community as a whole in the political process. She said she’s done this by hosting women’s health panels and other events that have educated people on ways to be politically active beyond just voting.Young said she hopes to continue the work the county is doing to address issues of sexual assault on campus by continuing to fund resources such as the Rape Crisis Center.What sets her apart, she said, is her detailed policy proposals. She said unlike her opponent, she has a firm understanding of what she wants to see accomplished at the county level.“[Tenorio] talks about addressing housing density, but that’s not in the jurisdiction of the county board,” Young said. “I’m talking about things we can actually do.”Young also points to her numerous endorsements, including five city council and board members, as further validation of her ability to effectively govern.As a sophomore and dual citizen of the Philippines and the U.S., Tenorio said his experiences as a multicultural student and discipline as an ROTC member give him a unique perspective on county issues.He said he can point to a history of working through ASM to solve issues of sexual assault and mental health as proof he is committed to working for the community.Tenorio, who has not yet selected a major, said he originally wanted to go to medical school, but after shadowing doctors, he realized there was more good to be done through public service.“I shadowed some doctors and I realized that I wouldn’t be able to solve the underlying problems they deal with as a doctor,” he said.During his time at ASM, Tenorio said he has served on the University Affairs Committee and worked with organizations such as Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment and the National Alliance on Mental Illness. He said he would continue working with ASM as a county board member to ensure resources are being used to address sexual assault and shortfalls in funding for mental health counseling.Tenorio said cleaning up Mendota Lake would be a big priority because he believes the county has thus far been “all talk and no action.” He said he hopes to put a stop to students having to swim in a dirty lake with regular algae blooms and phosphate runoff.Tenorio said he continues to reach out to students and county board members to better understand the issues facing students and the county as a whole. Because of this, he said the issues he will focus on continue to evolve as he speaks with more community members.“I remember summing up the courage to knock on that first door, and since then, I’ve learned a lot about campaigning and these issues,” Tenorio said.He said he hopes to continue learning from the experience of campaigning on how best to address the concerns of students and connect with his possible constituents.On fundamental issues, the two candidates admit there is little separating them. But Young claims her policy positions are more concrete while Tenorio believes his background speaks for itself.",Meet the candidates running for District 5’s county board seat,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2013/11/26/wis-see-ban-everclear-high-proof-alcohol-sales/,"Nov 26, 2013","Students may run into some obstacles with their wop and Jungle Juice-themed parties if a bill to ban all sale, consumption and possession of high proof alcohols such as Everclear gains traction.Rep. Terese Berceau, D-Madison, is looking for co-sponsors for a bill that would make all liquor containing 80 percent or more alcohol by volume or 160 proof illegal, citing the increasing number of students who are forced to go to detox due to overconsumption and the rates of sexual assault.There are currently 14 states that ban the sale of everclear and Wisconsin should to be the 15th, Berceau said.She said the purpose of the bill is to educate and spread awareness of the dangers that come with consuming high volume alcohols.“I think it’s been a challenge for a long time to get students to understand the dangers of high levels of alcohol use,” Berceau said.  “I think that most students think of it as just partying as opposed to life threatening and the other big issue on campuses has been an issue of sexual assault, non-consensual sex and knowing that a lot of it isn’t even reported.”States that currently ban the sale of Everclear include California, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan, New York, Nevada, Ohio, Washington, North Carolina, New Hampshire and Minnesota.Berceau said states are becoming aware of the dangers associated with drinking high proof alcohols and there is “no purpose” to be drinking high volume alcohol drinks.“The number of kids who have to be taken to a detox center has increased, but in particular the danger it poses that people do not understand the level of intoxication you get to very quickly would be from high alcohol drinks,” Berceau said.She said the bill has not seen much support yet, adding that the Wisconsin Tavern League and the alcohol industry are likely to lobby against the legislation. Nonetheless, Burceau said the importance of the bill is to educate.Marc Lovicott, spokesperson for the University of Wisconsin Police Department, said UWPD is in support of the bill.“Overall, we would support any law or bill that increases public safety. As you and others on campus may have seen in the last few months, we have been dealing with extremely high intoxication levels, 0.30 [blood alcohol content levels] and higher, which are dangerously high, almost deadly,” Lovicott said.High alcohol consumption has been a problem on campuses for years and the toxicity levels to many student is unknown, Berceau said.Berceau said students are more concerned with consuming higher volumes of alcohol for quicker intoxication without thinking of the possible outcomes.“A 120-pound woman with one shot of 160 proof can put her over the legal limit and I think it’s two shots, she could be very ill,” she said.  “There’s no real social purpose for this other than to get stinking drunk to the possible level of death.”ASM Legislative Affairs Vice Chair Morgan Rae said the bill is currently not a topic the student government is focusing on.Berceau’s bill will circulate for co-sponsorship until Wednesday, Dec. 4 .","Wis. could see ban on Everclear, high proof alcohol sales",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2016/10/20/easy-is-anything-but-to-watch/,"Oct 20, 2016","Contrary to its title, director Joe Swanberg’s latest project “Easy,” a Netflix series of eight episodes all centering on love and its complications, is difficult to watch.His previous films, “Drinking Buddies” and “Happy Christmas,” have set him up as an up-and-coming indie filmmaker with an eye for nuance and human sensibility, but “Easy” ultimately falls short despite its star power and eclectic vibe.“Easy,” on paper, is a great idea. The show depicts the stories of seven different groups of people, in vignette style, all navigating the hardships of being in and out of love, with Chicago as the backdrop. Featuring an ensemble cast with the likes of Marc Maron, Orlando Bloom, Malin Akerman and Hannibal Buress, the potential is high.The series starts off with the challenges Annie (Jane Adams) and Kyle (Michael Chernus) face with opposing gender roles. Kyle is a stay-at-home dad, Annie is the breadwinner. For starters, it’s never actually revealed what Annie’s job is outside the home. Nonetheless, the episode continues as the two spice up their sex lives with role playing on Halloween, while their kids are out trick-or-treating. As they attempt to carry out their fantasies, their iPhones incessantly ring and life invades their intimacy.What’s more, the night ends, after the children have been put to bed, with, to put it lightly, Kyle sexually forcing himself on Annie. The story concludes as she makes breakfast for the children, and Kyle slaps Annie’s butt as he sits down with the kids, beaming at his wife.‘Love,’ ‘Marseille,’ ‘Flaked’ lead strong Netflix Class of 2016
Despite already having changed the entertainment world permanently by cutting the link between cable TV and quality content, Netflix is Read…There is a lot to say about what’s going on in this episode. But to put it succinctly, nothing noteworthy comes out of it, except perhaps the subtle, nonchalant, marital sexual assault. This part aside, the viewer is left with a brief peek at an average, awkward family, which shows like “Modern Family” and “Transparent” have already offered, with far better results.Things do shake up in succeeding vignettes, but not in unfamiliar ways. The second episode, “Vegan Cinderella,” tells the story of two lesbians, portrayed in an insufferably stereotypical fashion, who negotiate the difficulties of being two different people, with contrasting interests, ethnicities and inclinations — one is a vegan, the other a woman only identified as black and a non-vegan. On the surface, this is a somewhat novel story, but if these two characters were white and heterosexual, this episode would be excruciatingly boring. It is as if Swanburg wants his audience to label him as progressive based solely on his artistic choice to feature two lesbians, one a woman of color.Maybe applying the storyline of Sherry (Aya Cash), Matt (Evan Jonigket) and Jeff (Dave Franco), in which two brothers start an illegal brewery unbeknownst to the wife, to this episode would have been a better choice.While some of these stories certainly have merit, they are often too deliberate to be taken seriously. The third episode, “Controlada,” centers on a Latino couple, composed of a domineering, career-driven husband and poorly fleshed out wife figure (a common theme among the female characters on this show). As with the two lesbians, the sole purpose of the episode is to show how Latinos are on TV now, saving little room for earnest representation.In addition, a second questionable sex scene emerges when Gabi’s (Aislinn Derbez) former lover, Martin (Mauricio Hockmann), coercively engages in sex with her, up against a floor-to-ceiling window facing the city (yikes!). The opportunity to present Latino culture in the United States is present, but ultimately squandered.The only thing the show arguably does well are the points where the audience often cringes to see what’s going to happen next. These uncomfortable situations are not difficult to watch because they promote a sense of progressivism on television, like Ilana Glazer’s bold, yet casual discussion of the perils of menstruation with her best friend and confidante, Abbi Jacobson, on “Broad City.’” They’re awkward because of the disappointment they instill.Overall, it’s great Swanberg features both interesting stories and honest characters in his show. But where he misses the mark is how they are paired and what they mean for finding love, as well textbook white person “diversity” for the sake of diversity.",‘Easy’ is anything but to watch,UWM

HolmquistStudents Ella Sklaw and Jeung Bok R. Holmquist teamed up with University Health Services to share their artwork with the rest of campus in an easily accessible way for students and young adults, to spread an important message demanding more attention.“[Sklaw] has previously done other consent focused Snapchat filters and projects in the past, and this year she got into making her own art and came to me for the graphic design/digital aspect of the project,” Holmquist said. “We brainstormed and crowdsourced consent phrases that we could potentially include in our art, Sklaw painted the hearts and phrases and I prepared the images for digital use.”Courtesy of Jeung Bok R HomlquistDue to constant notifications of reported sexual assault incidents on campus, the duo felt there was a need for this project now more than ever.Holmquist and Sklaw both understand consent may be a bit of an uncomfortable topic for some people to talk about because it has never been normalized. Their geotag aims to show others it doesn’t need to be this way.Courtesy of Jeung Bok R. Holmquist“I think that being sponsored by UHS for this project was really important,” Holmquist said. “UHS serves the student population, it is directly linked with the University and it is an established entity on campus. Partnering with them gave our project credibility from the start. A lot of intersectional feminist projects are often brushed off as niche or inaccessible to larger populations, but that just isn’t the case.”UHS is a great resource for victims seeking both medical or emotional support through their violence prevention and survivor services.

Remember: Whatever happened to you is not your fault and was never your fault.”If your friend is a survivor, Holmquist’s best advice is simply to love them, care for them and show them they deserve happiness and affection in their lives.

A follow-up report released in February 2019 by the Crime and Justice Institute in Boston stated that after the settlement was reached in the lawsuit between the Police department and the Wisconsin ACLU, 80 percent of Milwaukee Police Department’s stop-and-frisks still lacked justification. Not only have the stop-and-frisk practices lacked proper justification, but they have also overwhelmingly affected minority residents, specifically African American residents. Although African American people only represent 38 percent of the city’s population, an astounding 80 percent of frisks involved African Americans as well as 56 percent of police encounters. For comparison, white people represent 35 percent of the population and were only involved in 6 percent of frisks.  Bipartisan bill to end backlog of rape test kits should pass
A bipartisan bill taking aim at the overwhelming backlog of rape evidence test kits was passed in the Wisconsin Senate Read…Tracy Adams, a plaintiff in the suit, added that the complaint process in response to actions of police racism is complicated, bureaucratic and vague. When she asked for further clarification, she was met with the same ambiguous claims leading her nowhere. The complaints were over the maltreatment of her son who was first harassed in 2010 at age 11. Adams called the department to complain and a sergeant responded saying the Milwaukee Police officers have a policy to stop young men walking through alleys, a claim that is not even trying to hide its racist intentions.The problem with the stop-and-frisk policy is not in the details or how it is applied — the practice itself is unjust. The legal ability to stop a person with reasonable cause — not probable cause — and proceed to search them allows too much power to any individual, no matter their level of training. Especially in a country and a policing system with a history of racist attitudes and actions, this gross misuse of power consistently leads to racial discrimination, specifically against young Latino and African American men. Milwaukee is not unique in its use of stop-and-frisk. The Madison Police Department allows a similar practice.Getting ICE involved in sexual assault cases targets victims as well as perpetrators

Although Madison is yet to have any major reported cases of police abuse of this power, the existence of a stop-and-frisk allows for its possibility, and while generally clean, the MPD has dealt with racial profiling in the past. One particular case led to the creation of a new state bill designed to prevent future cases of profiling. In 2018, while campaigning in a majority white neighborhood in Madison, someone called the police on a suspicious-looking woman who in reality was state representative Sheila Stubbs, D-Wisconsin. Once the police arrived, Stubbs was held, tediously questioned and the police asked for multiple forms of identification. The department’s stop-and-frisk policy is pretty detailed, but the problem is not in their specific policy but in the idea of reasonable suspicion which, as stated earlier, is very different than the more commonly understood probable suspicion or cause. Reasonable suspicion is defined as not capable of a precise definition and is generally based on the individual officer’s hunch.New bill of rights for crime victims will make Wisconsin, UW safer

https://badgerherald.com/features/2018/05/01/stigmas-surrounding-stis-hinder-conversations-about-sexual-health/,"May 1, 2018","Heather* had recently broken up with her partner when she began experiencing painful symptoms in her vaginal region, to the point where she couldn’t walk.She visited a clinic nearby and received a diagnosis of Herpes Simplex Virus 1, commonly known as cold sores of the mouth. It was her first year at the University of Wisconsin.“It was the worst news of my life. I thought my life was over,” Heather said. “I thought no one would ever want to be near me again.”Now a senior, Heather has had to share that diagnosis with other partners and navigate ways to have the often uncomfortable conversation about sexual health with them.Broaching this topic proves difficult, even for individuals who do not have a sexually transmitted infection. When they are had, the conversations are often uninformed and can further debilitating myths and stereotypes.“[Partners] have mostly been like, ‘I get it, it’s hard, do you have an outbreak right now?’ And I’m like, ‘no, otherwise I wouldn’t be doing this’ and they’re like, ‘alright then we’re good,’” Heather said. “Then I try to extra explain to them that you can still get it even if I’m not having an outbreak.”STIs are very common — about 20 million new cases occur every year, according to the Center for Disease Control, with about half of those affecting 15-24 year olds.Still, living with an STI can be a silent and lonesome diagnosis. Testing positive rarely means the end of the world, but it nearly always means living with the weight of a stigma.“It was the worst news of my life. I thought my life was over. I thought no one would ever want to be near me again.”
HeatherCaroline* felt an instant sinking feeling when she was told she tested positive for chlamydia.“This isn’t something anybody wants,” Caroline said. “I was scared.”Initially caught off guard, she took a moment to remind herself STIs are frequent and that once she got the prescription, she’d be OK.STIs are common on campus, Sex Out Loud program facilitator Madison Neinfeldt said. Chlamydia, molluscum contagiosum (bumps on the skin), HPV and herpes remain the four most common diagnoses.“Society has this perception that once someone has an STI, it’s a death sentence and their life is over,” Neinfeldt said.For Heather, negative connotations and alienation muddle conversations surrounding STIs.An STI, Heather said, is seen as such a “funny” thing to joke about. She witnesses these jokes everywhere from movies to regular conversations. Though rarely intentionally malicious, Heather feels like an outsider whenever she hears them.“People joke about herpes all the time. It’s in movies. It’s in daily conversations,” Heather said. “It’s such a funny thing to joke about for some reason and then when it actually happens to you, my first thought was ‘wow, I’m a joke now.’ I felt like a leper, I felt untouchable.”Unlike many other infections, the initial reaction to receiving an STI diagnosis is shame and isolation.PEYTON DAVID/The Badger HeraldWhen she was diagnosed, Heather found solace in online forums with individuals who were going through a similar experience.The partner who she suspected passed HSV1 to her was also going through the same thing, and she continued to see him.Because society sees STIs as shameful, people don’t readily talk about them, which can lead to isolation for those who tested positive, University Health Services nurse practitioner Elizabeth Falk-Hanson said.This alienated Heather and created awkward moments with her partners.  “I don’t really know anyone who has this diagnosis,” Heather said. “I’ve had a lot of shit happen to me and I know people who have had that shit happen to them but this is the first time where I can’t really bond with anyone over this … either they don’t have it or they’re not talking about it.”When Caroline learned she tested positive for chlamydia, she told her female friends but refrained from telling her male friends for fear they would find her “gross.”STIs are associated with words like “dirty,” “gross” and “diseased.” However, with few exceptions, most STIs are curable like any other infection.Sexual health is just like any other type of health, Colton Schellinger, UW senior, said.Caroline said she wishes more people would take an honest approach. It doesn’t make sense that people aren’t transparent about their sexual health, she said.“If you want to have a conversation with someone [about STIs], you shouldn’t have to feel afraid about it,” Caroline said.When it comes to STIs, most people gather their knowledge and form perceptions long before they even enter intimate relationships.Madhuvanthi Sridhar, a UW senior, grew up in India. Some of her first experiences talking about sexual health were in college.UW senior and former facilitator for Sex Out Loud Char’lee King said she went to a Catholic high school. She didn’t have much sexual health education until she took it upon herself to learn.UW sophomore Elizabeth Meek said in an email to The Badger Herald her sexual education was “spotty at best.” Meek’s school’s approach was to promote abstinence as the way to avoid STIs because condoms can fail.“There was no talk of receptive condoms, dental dams, knowing your status or how to ask for certain tests to be done at the doctor’s office,” Meek said. “Just look up the ‘Mean Girls’ chlamydia scene and you’ll have a pretty good idea of my high school.”But sometimes, instead of seeking to educate, sex educators use fear-based tactics to dissuade students from partaking in sexual activities. For example, Heather’s health class showed scary pictures of what could happen to individuals if they contract an STI.Sexual education should be reinforced in college, Heather said.But because of where the university’s money goes to and where it comes from, they can’t always sponsor sexual health education, Neinfeldt said. That’s where programs like Sex Out Loud comes in.“If you want to have a conversation with someone [about STIs], you shouldn’t have to feel afraid about it.”
Caroline‘Just like an ear infection’One common misconception is that preventative measures always protect against STIs, King said.  Like any other aspect of physical health, STI check-ups are important in maintaining sexual health, Falk-Hanson said. Not every infection has symptoms, so individuals should rely more on screenings.STIs can occur in newly committed relationships, Falk-Hanson said in an email to The Badger Herald. So casual hookups aren’t the only times people should consider getting tested. Many people find themselves with an STI diagnosis despite no symptoms or any reason to suspect risk — particularly for chlamydia and gonorrhea.Chlamydia and gonnorhea can be detected almost immediately after testing, Falk-Hanson said. STIs including HIV and syphilis, however, can take a little longer to detect. So individuals should have that conversation with a health care provider to understand the risk factors and timeline for different infections.“Getting checked is a good thing to do,” Schellinger said. “If anyone opens up to you about [being positive], be cool about it.”At the very least, individuals should be checking on sexual health annually, Falk-Hanson said. But for those who have had multiple partners, she encourages checking in more frequently.Additionally, the language used when talking about STIs contributes to how people think about them, Neinfeldt said.“Just like an ear infection, they’re very common,” Neinfeldt said. “That’s why [Sex Out Loud] tries to refer to them as STIs instead of STDs, being that there’s no symptoms a lot of the time.”Chlamydia, HPV and molluscum contagiosum are all treatable with antibiotics, Neinfeldt said. Getting regular testing and catching STIs early on is the best way to allow them to go away on their own.There are treatment options for incurable infections — such as herpes — that make outbreaks much more manageable, Neinfeldt said. Knowing the facts and statistics about STIs along with using specific language to talk about them can help debunk myths, Neinfeldt said.For example, transmitting an STI, though a medically accurate term, can sound scary, Neinfeldt said. “Passing along an STI” is a more comforting phrase.In Sex Out Loud programs, facilitators encourage participants to refrain from using phrases like “I’m clean.” Instead, Neinfeldt said people should say “I’m negative for an STI.”“If we say ‘I’m clean,’ what’s the opposite of that? ‘I’m dirty,’” Neinfeldt said. “People who have STIs aren’t inherently dirty.”The way to clear STI stigmas on interpersonal and institutional levels is through education, King said.“I sat [my boyfriend] down one day and was like ‘look, I get cold sores, which is technically herpes, and just so you know, I can give it to you sexually … I think you need to know that there’s a risk of that and if that’s not something you want to do, then that’s okay,’” Heather said.Though reactions have been mainly positive and her partners have been relatively understanding, Heather has had her diagnosis weaponized against her.“To really destigmatize STIs is to really educate people about them. We can say ‘oh, they’re not really a big deal’ but unless people believe it, it’s not going to work.”
Char'lee King, Sex Out Loud FacilitatorWith that partner, she didn’t realize she had the potential to spread her STI to him, so they had unprotected sex. He later told her he had contracted it.“I would never wish that upon anyone. I would never want to give that to anyone, I just felt terrible. But because he really liked me and because I wasn’t as responsive, he used it against me. Saying like ‘you ignored me and didn’t talk to me and now I have this,’” Heather said. “That was really hard to hear because of course, that wasn’t my intention but people can use that and use that against you as if you did that intentionally.”Conversations like the one Heather had with her boyfriend need to happen outside the bedroom instead of waiting until the heat of the moment, Neinfeldt said. That way, there’s no awkward disruption. Being out of a sexual atmosphere and talking about STIs, especially with a new partner, relieves some of the pressure.Caroline found out she was positive via a text from a past partner, saying he was positive for chlamydia. At that time, she was seeing someone else. When she found out, she told her partner she had hooked up with someone over the summer and that he should get tested.“I had to uncomfortably tell [my partner] … I had hooked up with someone a couple months ago, ‘I got this, you should get tested.’ He also had it,” Caroline said. “He wasn’t mad, he was really understanding about the whole thing. I think he was obviously curious because I told him prior to this that I usually use condoms … I had to explain to him that it was one of my ex-boyfriends, but overall he was very understanding about the whole thing.”People often feel uncomfortable talking about STIs, especially with someone they don’t know that well, Neinfeldt said.Meek has an “elevator speech” that encompasses her name, pronouns, sexual preferences and status.“Everyone’s elevator speech can be different but you can toss it out, like: ‘I’m Elizabeth, my pronouns are she, her, hers … I’m not looking for anything serious right now, just looking for a hookup, I do not have any STIs, I was recently tested a month ago … and I’m adamant about using safer sex supplies,’” Meek said. “I don’t necessarily go about it like ‘here’s my elevator speech!’ … it’s more of a spread out thing.”It’s not a fun thing to talk about, Heather said. That’s why people don’t talk about it and that’s how misinformation gets spread.Schellinger said he had a partner disclose to him that he had an STI. Though they never had sex, his partner outright told him.“Communication is the foundation of everything,” King said. “No matter if it’s a long-time relationship or a friend with benefits situation, we can be like ‘hey, I have this thing, and we don’t have to say why this is a thing but I just want to let you know before we continue further … let’s figure out how we want to move forward.’”Because Schellinger had been previously exposed to friends who had disclosed to him they had STIs, he didn’t have a strong reaction.Others, like King, ask their partners when they were last tested. If it’s out of the three to six month recommended range, she asks them if they’d be willing to get that updated. But King said she understands talking about being positive for an STI can be embarrassing and uncomfortable.To alleviate discomfort, Falk-Hanson recommended using “I statements” instead of “you statements.”“‘I’d feel more comfortable if we were using condoms or if we could talk about when you were last tested,’” Falk-Hanson said. “Otherwise it can be implying […] ‘I don’t trust you’ or think that you have something, so I think reframing it as a ‘me statement’ and trying to say that ‘I’ll enjoy this more if I can feel more comfortable knowing that we’re reducing our risks.’”That conversation should happen before sexual activities ensue, Neinfeldt said. This has to do with the definition of consent, which is fully knowing what one can expect throughout their sexual encounter.“To really destigmatize STIs is to really educate people about them,” King said. “We can say ‘oh, they’re not really a big deal’ but unless people believe it, it’s not going to work.”If you think you have an STI, reach out to UHS for an initial screening.*Names have been changed to protect the privacy of some sources who have contracted STIs.",Stigmas surrounding STIs hinder conversations about sexual health,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2020/04/14/sexpositive-education-with-no-federal-mandates-on-sex-ed-students-recieve-vastly-different-information-affects-college-experience/,"Apr 14, 2020","Erica Koepsel’s sex education experience didn’t start in middle school or high school like other students — it started years later, in college.“I’m born and raised in Kansas and then went to college in a small school in Topeka, Kansas, where we had a gender and women’s studies course that I took,” Koepsel said. “[The course] brought in a sexual health educator who taught us all about contraception. And leaving that class, I was livid that no one had taught me that in high school and that I didn’t have the information that I — or really that my friends — needed.”Koepsel said she was so interested in why she lacked sex education in high school — and making sure other high schoolers wouldn’t have that experience — that she started to intern, volunteer and work in sexual health education, she said.Ten years after her gender and women’s studies course, Koepsel is now the Program Manager for Providers and Teens Communicating for Health, a youth-driven, Madison-based program working to ensure all adolescents are able to receive high-quality health care services in their community.In the cult classic film “Mean Girls,” the grossly incompetent gym teacher, Coach Carr, doubles as the sex ed instructor. “Don’t have sex, because you will get pregnant and die,” he proclaims. “Just don’t do it, OK, promise?”This is just one example of what teens grow up hearing about sex education and sexual health. These messages, along with the ones received in high school, tend to stick with students throughout their lives, according to Assistant Professor of Gender and Women’s Studies at the University of Wisconsin Chris Barcelos.The problem with students remembering these messages, Barcelos said, is while some people receive comprehensive sex education in high school, others receive no sex education or even incorrect information. And Koepsel said in her work she too has found that many issues can arise with poor or nonexistent sexual health education.“If you have poor sex education — if you have sex education that’s bad, wrong or shaming — that can cause a lot of identity crisis issues,” Koepsel said. “Especially with young LGBTQ people or people that might just be exploring their own identity, if they have had a sexual health [program] that has only shown sex as penile-vaginal intercourse there’s a huge part missing.”Koepsel said one of the biggest problems she faces with the sex education her PATCH students receive is that students are not taught communication skills around sex. This creates problems with consent and students not having agency in their own sexual experiences because they haven’t been taught how to say yes or no to things, or even what they’re talking about to begin with.Barcelos said even when schools teach comprehensive sex education, it’s typically abstinence-only and heteronormative. Not only can this create negative gender power dynamics — it doesn’t stress other crucial elements.“If you have poor sex education — if you have sex education that’s bad, wrong or shaming — that can cause a lot of identity crisis issues. Especially with young LGBTQ people or people that might just be exploring their own identity, if they have had a sexual health [program] that has only shown sex as penile-vaginal intercourse there’s a huge part missing.”
Erica Koepsel, Program Manager at PATCH“Even when sex education is comprehensive or evidence-based, it [often] doesn’t talk about consent, it doesn’t talk about pleasure,” Barcelos said. “It still positions women and girls as passive defenders of boys and men who are going to try to convince them to do things they don’t want to do. You know, it’s very heterosexist. So even sex education that’s good is pretty [hard to come by] and is often pretty stigmatizing around sexual health.”Barcelos added that stigmatizing sexual health education, combined with the misinformation found in movies and pop culture, can create life-long problems for people — resulting in not being ready to handle situations that will likely come up in their lives.“Young people get a lot of wrong and harmful information, and not the skills they need either — like how to negotiate consent, or how to deal with an unintended pregnancy, or how to cope with living with an STI or any of the skills they may need as adults,” Barcelos said. But, Barcelos said the biggest problem the United States faces in sex education is the huge discrepancy of what students learn state-to-state.“Most states do not require that their sex education be medically accurate, so there’s no guarantee that the sex education you actually got was accurate,” Barcelos said. “Some states actually have laws where you can only talk about LGBTQ people as bad.”In the U.S., 29 states mandate sex education, with only 17 of those states requiring the information to be medically accurate, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Wisconsin does not fall into either one of those categories.In Wisconsin, school districts are required to teach HIV education, which must stress abstinence. Additionally, when sex education is provided in schools, abstinence must be stressed as well as the importance of sex only within a marriage. Information on dating and sexual violence prevention also needs to be distributed.Koepsel said with these mandates, so much of the sex education that happens in Wisconsin schools is left open for each school to decide. Because of this, each school is different, so students from neighboring towns can have vastly different knowledge.“In the state of Wisconsin, no one knows what’s happening in any given school, minus the students. And I think that’s the biggest challenge,” Koepsel said.Associate Director of Teaching & Learning in the Green Bay School District Eric Conn said their schools teach abstinence-only sex education in high school with information on puberty and reproduction in fourth through sixth grade. Conn said he believes they have a comprehensive sex education curriculum.“Our Human Growth and Development curriculum in middle and high school provides students instruction in a wide variety of knowledge and skills in the subject, as well as exceeding the minimum requirements outlined in state statute,” Conn said in an email to The Badger Herald. But, Morgan Healey, a junior at UW who went to Green Bay Southwest High School, said she remembers learning more about performance-enhancing drugs in health class than sex education in middle school. “Looking back I never had high school sex education that I can remember… so if we did it clearly didn’t have much of an impression on me,” Healey said. “I do remember a small amount of sex education in middle school.”CHANNING SMITH/The Badger HeraldKoepsel said when students from across the country come together in college, all with the different levels of sex education, it can be difficult to navigate those differences. “We’re coming in with so many different areas of knowledge — as educators who don’t know what other educators are doing, as teens who don’t know what other teens have learned — and all meeting in that common space at colleges or universities, or in workforces,” Koepsel said. “So I think the fact that it’s so different and that no one really knows what’s happening makes it so much harder.”Barcelos said with the messages about sex kids see in pop culture as they grow up, students come to college pressured to be part of hookup culture — which exposes the discrepancies in sex education and leads to unpreparedness and stigma when something goes wrong.“[Students] are in a situation where there’s pressure to be part of hookup culture, and so then when someone gets an STI or has an unplanned pregnancy or something like that, they are totally stigmatized,” Barcelos said. “Then that stigma is part of what prevents people from not just having safer sex, but having a fulfilling sex life.”Different levels of sex education can also present inequalities, Barcelos said, as families who can afford to send their student to private school may receive better sex education, as they are not bound by federal and state funding. On the flip side, however, high schoolers attending religious private schools can often be taught misleading or incorrect information.This was the case for John Spengler, a sophomore at UW who went to a private Catholic school in northwest Ohio and received no sex ed outside of Catholic family planning methods. For Spengler, coming to college was a large culture shock. “The extent to which [UW], especially dorms, was open about sexual topics was somewhat surprising,” Spengler said. “While I always figured that there would certainly be sexual education opportunities available to all students, I can’t say I anticipated walking into the Witte bathrooms at 9 a.m. on a Friday and seeing dozens of condoms spread out on the counter.”“[Students] are in a situation where there’s pressure to be part of hookup culture, and so then when someone gets an STI or has an unplanned pregnancy or something like that, they are totally stigmatized. Then that stigma is part of what prevents people from not just having safer sex, but having a fulfilling sex life.”
Chris Barcelos, UW Assistant Professor of Gender and Women's StudiesWhile he does believe there should be general better sex education in private schools, Spengler said he believes better sexual education was not necessary for him in high school, as he attended public school until 9th grade where he received comprehensive sex ed. Sex education can vary even more for international students, as depending on their countries, talking about sex may be considered “taboo.” This was the case for Arushi Gupta, a freshman at UW who went to high school in Delhi National Capital Region, India. She did not receive explicit sex education whatsoever.“Even though I’m from a pretty big city, I still come from a country where talking about sex is taboo,” Gupta said. “The education system requires all sophomores to study menstruation and reproduction, but safe sex is not mentioned in any textbook until your senior year, if you choose to continue studying biology.”Gupta said while she does not think the lack of sex education she received affected her experience coming to UW, she does believe every person should receive sex education in high school because puberty takes place at this time. It is also important to know about STIs, how to practice safe sex and about different contraception methods, she said.For students who feel that “culture shock” at UW, there are programs and clubs on campus to help. One of these organizations is Sex Out Loud, UW’s peer-to-peer sexual health resource. It provides students with inclusive and accessible comprehensive sexuality education programs, events and resources, and creates safe spaces where students can freely discuss these issues, Chair of Sex Out Loud Song Kim said.Kim said one of the biggest problems the organization faces is realizing the shallowness of sex education programs students receive before coming to UW.“As amazing as it is to hear how life-changing the information provided at Sex Out Loud can be for some folks, that reality is disheartening,” Kim said. “Much of the sex education that the average American teenager receives is often based in purely preventative reproductive healthcare. Meaning, there often is no discussion of sex as part of human nature for many people, or a discussion on steps to take after testing positive for a sexually transmitted infection or a pregnancy test.”Kim, like Barcelos, said this form of sex education can be uninclusive to many, as it is typically heteronormative and sex-negative.No matter how comprehensive the sex education curriculum is at a school, Barcelos said it is hard to imagine there ever being a completely inclusive, sex-positive focus. But, Barcelos believes there is a way to educate young people accurately on sexual health and education — with the internet.“We know from research that a lot of young people learn about sex from peers and the internet,” Barcelos said. “I think that that is only going to continue, and that cultivating those as useful and reliable sources of information… [is] maybe a better strategy than trying to fix sex education in schools, which I kind of feel like is unfixable.”And while there are definite problems within sex education in schools, Healey said talking about it is really the first step.“I think the first step to anything is talking about it, as cliche as that might sound,” Healey said. “Learning to have a conversation definitely prepared me to be more comfortable with the idea, but there is definitely more work to be done if the current education is anything like eight years ago.”","Sex[Positive] Education: With no federal mandates on sex ed, students receive vastly different information, affects college experience",UWM

Rep. Jill Billings, D-La Crosse, said this act has helped to bolster the efforts of the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families, as well as legislative efforts to address child sex trafficking, by offering grant money and aid to victims.Wisconsin stakeholders take a variety of approaches to address human trafficking

A number of bipartisan bills passed through the Assembly Tuesday including bills to protect victims of sexual assault, wrongly convicted Read…Child sex trafficking is defined as knowingly recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing or obtaining someone under 18 for a commercial sex act or sexual exploitation, Yates said. Some children are abducted and taken into the illegal business, but it is more common for children to lured in by traffickers.If a child has an unsupportive family, deals with abuse or needs food or resources, it is easier for them to be targeted, Yates said. It is also important to note that children who are being sex trafficked are not prostitutes, they are being exploited, Yates added. She said many children see themselves as criminals, rather than victims, and will not seek help.Right now, children can be charged for prostitution if they are being sex trafficked, Billings said. In the next legislative session, Billings said she wants to introduce a bill that prevents this and ensures children are treated as victims.Scialfa said as part of the anti-trafficking program, there are five workgroups that will each develop specific action plans and provide recommendations to the state. The workgroups’ focuses are training, prevention and public awareness, screening and identification, data and research and placement and services.The training workgroup will develop common training materials for all systems that could interact with survivors including teachers, law enforcement, health professionals, foster parents and legal professionals.The identification and screening workgroup aims to help professionals better identify potential victims of trafficking, Yates said. The other programs will spread awareness to communities, collect data about programs and policies and improve treatment options.Yates said Wisconsin already has many different programs in place that work to address child sex trafficking, but the goal is to strengthen them.“We don’t want to take the place of existing local organizations — we want to support and enhance their work,” Yates said.Student-run ‘A Just Brew’ refreshing player in Madison’s coffee scene

Before attending UW, I already heard of stories of challenges to diversity and injustices against people of different backgrounds. But, I would have never thought that there are students that have to first focus on surviving the day, and then focus on surviving the classroom.Part of my duties as Class President is to promote the Wisconsin Experience and the Wisconsin Idea. Still, it’s hard to bring students together and facilitate learning, when students are spit on by others because of their skin color, or students hack UW Printers to have them print racist and homophobic statements, or even with the fact that UW-Madison is 4th in the nation for federal investigations for sexual assault. Let it be known, even though we are on a campus of 43,000, you will meet someone who has experienced some sort of injustice on this campus.My freshman year, a group of white students were walking down the street towards me. Without cause, one of the white students proceeded to call me a “fucking chink.” I brushed it off at first, but how can it be normal or even be labeled a joke to insult someone for their race? It’s even worse because I’m not Chinese, but Filipino and African American. The University states under the Wisconsin Experience, that students leave with “Intercultural knowledge and competence.”But, where is the evidence of UW promoting this on campus? Sure, some students here come from a town of 1,000 and some from a city of 1 million. Not everyone has had the experiences to interact with different types of people. But, I was truly challenged of my identity when a student stated that I didn’t look Black enough to be Black and I didn’t act Asian enough to be Asian, during my freshman year.My experiences aren’t even comparable to others’ who have been treated far worse, but nonetheless, promoting racial stereotypes and attacking student’s identities does not embody the Wisconsin Experience and has no place on this campus. If students first attend this University thinking it’s acceptable to encourage stereotypes and walk outside in public and shout racial slurs, we need to invest in resources to erase it by the time students leave.It’s even far more shameful that these issues have been going on for years, but recent events on campus has alerted many students as if this was a random occurrence. The time for campus-wide emails and community sit-downs are ineffective and over.It’s time to pick up the pace and for the University to pick a side.They can either hold dearly to the status quo, or they can join students and find ways to promote the resources and opportunities that cornered students are pleading for. Unless pen is put to paper, these protests will not divide, but only multiply, and our University will be further stained by community apathy towards injustice on campus.Nonetheless, fellow students also need to step up, for neutrality is only going further the oppressor’s cause. No matter how large or small, all students have a part to play, for we decide how great this campus can be. The faster we can promote programs, education, and funding for equity and inclusion on campus, the faster we can get back to enjoying the Badgers in the 4th quarter and relaxing on the Terrace. –Andre Hunter Jr",Voices of UW: #TheRealUW from class of 2017 president,UWM

He is also not allowed access to social media and must refrain from using any drugs while out on bail.In a WiscAlert sent out Friday afternoon, UW warned community members of Cook’s release. The notification encouraged students to call 911 if they see Cook on campus property since he is banned from the UW campus.Calling the notification an “invitation for vigilante justice,” Van Wagner said he was astonished and upset the university sent out the alert.While Cook’s bail conditions prohibit him from being on campus property, he is allowed to be on the UW campus in the presence of his parents or attorneys, especially if he is to attend a UW disciplinary hearing.“Our client is not the boogeyman: He is a 20-year-old innocent man and is entitled to be released on bond and should not be made to subject to a boogeyman alert,” Van Wagner said. “Reading this [alert] makes it seems like the university police are bound and determined to make sure Alec Cook can never get a fair trial.”If not intentionally, Van Wagner said this notification implicitly invites those who are not unhappy with the allegations to take vigilante action against Cook.Cook currently faces a 21-count criminal complaint against 10 women.

America’s sensitive sweetheart, Drake, sings to a woman he believes has changed for the worse, asking her: “Why you never alone/Why you always touching road/Used to always stay at home, be a good girl/You was in the zone.”Can the “Hotline Bling” woman not be “in the zone” if she’s not at home waiting for Drake’s calls each night? Does wearing less or going out more mean this woman is inherently less likely to be successful or make her undeserving of respect?Drake’s lyrics are more than just a song — they reflect a much larger cultural phenomenon insisting women can’t be two things at once. We can be a “good girl,” who works hard and stays home waiting for phone calls, or we can be a “bad girl,” who is considered less respectable for going out and chasing independence.It’s time to face your fear of feminism

Somehow, people still can’t shake the idea women’s respectability is contingent on their adherence to puritan values that equate “goodness” with being quiet, submissive, virginally pure and modest.It’s 2017, and even though casual sex is pretty common these days, a lot of guys still have a hard time understanding how counterintuitive it is to simultaneously shame women for having sex with them yet get mad when women won’t “put out.” How can you flood a woman’s inbox with messages for months begging her for sex, then turn around and insult the same woman for wanting to have sex, just because it’s not with you?Many claim women in the workforce who do equal work are valued as much as men are, but turn around and argue multi-millionaire businesswomen like Beyonce or Kim Kardashian aren’t good at anything but being sexy. This reiterates the very idea a woman simultaneously being sexy and being intelligent, competent, business-savvy and respectable is still extremely hard for many people to wrap their heads around.Most people agree today we should respect women, but many see no issue with their need to tell themselves this particular woman could be someone’s mother or sister to do so. Why does a woman’s respectability have anything to do with her relationship with men? Is a woman’s humanity gauged on what her relationship is to other, more important people?Mandatory paid maternity not a revolutionary idea, but necessary nevertheless
Women in the United States, as of late, have gotten the relatively short end of the stick. Amid the Republican-led Read…Sadly, “respecting” women just because they fill a narrow role misogyny defines as “respectable” is actually the opposite of respecting women. People who can’t or won’t respect women simply because women are human beings don’t respect women at all.If we truly want women to be equal, to stop being viewed as objects or as only good enough to fill supporting roles, then, as a society, we must stop forcing women into narrowly defined categories that prevent us from respecting them simply on the grounds that they are human beings.No woman is all good or all bad, entirely “pure,” or entirely sexual, or just a mother or daughter or student or teacher or business woman or sex worker. Newsflash: It’s 2017, and women can be lots of things at once. Refusing to understand this fact contributes to our culture’s insistence on defining women in terms of their relationships with other people.Until our society can see women as the fully human, multidimensional, ever-changing beings we are, women will never truly be respected as equals, and issues like objectification, sexual assault, violence, unequal pay, lack of bodily autonomy and harassment will continue to hurt us every day.Julia O’Donnell (julesyann19@gmail.com) is a senior majoring in journalism and strategic communication.","Women are so much more than just sisters, mothers, wives",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2012/03/12/dangerous-areas-need/,"Mar 12, 2012","As a freshman, one of the first things I was told was “Don’t walk Rapeshore alone at night.” As unflattering as that nickname is, “Rapeshore” doesn’t only describe Lakeshore Path anymore.Women have been sexually assaulted all across campus. In many of the articles reflecting on them, sources such as police officers and Ald. Mike Verveer, District 4, have stated lack of lighting is a factor in referring to the University Avenue assault. When a solution as simple as lighting may help to provide a safer campus to the student body, why has nothing been done?According to the 2011-12 UW Campus Safety Guide, there are more than 100 blue emergency phone lights throughout dangerous parts of campus. Offhand, I can only recall two, both located along Lakeshore Path. While this is nowhere near enough lights on the otherwise unlit path, my question is: Where are the rest? Where was the blue light in the Hawthorne Court alleyway, a blatantly sketchy part of the campus area, where a young woman was recently assaulted? There are many places where walking alone at night can be rendered unsafe. A college campus should not be one of them.To some extent, the university has acknowledged the danger present on our campus after nightfall. Programs such as SAFEwalk, SAFEride and SAFEbus exist to offer accompaniment to individuals in the form of a free walk home, six free cab rides per semester as well as a free bus system. While a great concept, the programs have their flaws. Many times, those who need assistance are outside of SAFEwalk’s boundaries or aren’t in compliance with other restrictions. Other times, students don’t want to wait the usual 30 or more minutes before a SAFEcab or SAFEwalk arrives and opt to walk home instead. And why shouldn’t walking be an option? It’s unfair for students to feel too unsafe to walk home on our college campus. With more lights present, we wouldn’t.On a personal note, during welcome week this past summer, a friend and I were stopped by the police while walking home around midnight. We were reprimanded for walking alone and asked if we were aware of the sexual assaults taking place across campus and how unsafe it is for two young women to walk home alone unaccompanied. During a follow-up meeting with an assistant student dean, information pertaining to how unsafe our campus is was firmly drilled into my mind. The dean held up a stack of yellow folders and explained those were all the unresolved sexual assault cases on campus, and that those files only pertained to when he was on duty. He was one of five assistant student deans. My interaction with the police occurred at the intersection of Park Street and Dayton Street, a location where an incident had occurred not long before I decided to walk home.The heightened number of sexual assaults calls for immediate police action. However, a very obvious first step is the addition of lights and emergency telephones across campus. Blue light emergency phones should be placed across campus, not only in areas deemed “dangerous” or “unsafe.” I would never have imagined an area as highly populated as University Avenue would have been the location for a sexual assault, so reading about a woman having been pulled off the street and assaulted in Hawthorne Court hit close to home. I have frequently walked University Avenue at night, and maybe it’s just luck that I myself haven’t been assaulted. None of the student body should feel unsafe while walking at night in a city that we’ve all come to know as home.Christin Wiegand (cdwiegand@wisc.edu) is a sophomore with an undeclared major.",Dangerous areas need lighting,UWM

While accountability was not brought up as a critical issue during conversations with members of the NPHC and MGC, that did not hold true for all councils.IFC and Panhellenic council members, according to the report, didn’t address using their own judicial or standards boards to resolve infractions committed by their members.While IFC has a Judicial Board, the report stated that “its function was unclear.” A Panhellenic Council Judicial Board was brought up, but the report stated that no conversation was directed in verifying whether this was an operational or effective tool or deterrent.The Committee on Student Organizations, according to the report, brought on almost universal negative connotations. Chapter members, student officers and alumnus advisers complained that CSO had a lack of transparency, a process that appeared to apply differently to Greek life organizations versus other student organizations, sanctions that were not deemed fitting to the violation and confusion over what role different staff members played in the process.The report stated that “students feel that they cannot ask clarifying questions about policy because in doing so they might raise suspicion of a staff member and will then be scrutinized in the future.” It went on to state that students would thrive best in environments that promoted open dialogues about different situations and their consequences if that becomes relevant.External review team will assess sorority and fraternity life, UW announces

The benchmarks of our department are community-based and trust-based, and to establish relationships with the students is really important.”DeSpain said the purpose of having officers who take on certain areas or streets is to help facilitate relationship building.He added that these good relationships promote good communication, which he said is key in MPD doing their jobs.“We can’t do it on our own,” DeSpain said. “All those good people who live on Langdon [Street], they need to communicate quickly with us so we can take care of things if the need arises.”SSFC discusses ethical protocols for allocating student fees

However, when MGC/NPHC Greek students “[did] good,” it didn’t receive any recognition.The students added that this treatment discrepancy heightened the marginalization they already felt: a student of color said that generally, students of color can be left “feeling that they are not being supported.”The report detailed that some NPHC Chapter Advisors said, and was corroborated by staff members that “students of color figuring things out on their own” was a commonplace occurrence in the community.Regarding drinking, the report said that while UW has a well-researched aggregate of data on “alcohol issues” in the community, that data didn’t appear to be being used in creating effective intervention strategies.The report was also very firm about UW’s involvement in curbing sexual assault issues in Greek life.“. . .

https://badgerherald.com/news/2015/11/03/transcript-the-badger-herald-sits-down-with-chancellor-rebecca-blank-lori-berquam/,"Nov 3, 2015","The Badger Herald sat down with Chancellor Rebecca Blank and Dean of Students Lori Berquam on Oct. 28 to discuss a range of topics including sexual assault, tenure policy, concealed carry on campus and diversity.Below is a transcript of the conversation, which has been edited for style and clarity.Rebecca Blank: That’s a good question. I’m not sure that most of the fundamental goals have changed, I mean the sense of what is it this university needs to do to move forward in terms of its education mission and to move forward in terms of its research mission. I don’t think my sense of that has changed a lot. It’s certainly deepened and gotten a lot more nuanced as I’ve gotten to know the campus and our programs and the people a lot better.It was really interesting because usually you do a first year and you go through everything and by the second year you say, “Oh yeah I did that before.” The second year with the budget in it was so entirely different from the first year. It was really interesting, it was just like a whole different job the second year than the first year. I’ll now find out in two more years if that’s the pattern or if it changes again. I think part of what I have learned is this is a little harder than I probably would have thought, and maybe hoped.There’s just a lot more issues that need to be publicly discussed about what is higher education and what is the role of campus and what role do we play in the state and I think I’ve learned that I can’t take anything for granted about those issues. Because there are more people than I wished there were who clearly see those issues in a very different way than I think I do, or many people on this campus do. So the need to promote that discussion becomes very important.The subsidiary piece of that coming out of last year is the sense that we really are facing a long term period, you know as the economy recovering, I think I was hopeful that we wouldn’t be in serious financial troubles because an economic expansion is often when states invest more in higher education. Because this state is not experiencing quite the same level of economic expansion or income growth, we are still in a time of economic contraction in terms of the state dollars into this university.That in itself creates, more of my time has gone into that than I probably would have predicted initially coming in. Probably every public university president says that two years in.RB: The need to really talk at a pretty fundamental level about what is the university, why does it matter, what does it do for the state. And not to take any of that for granted, I think that’s important. I do think quite a lot of people in the state understand our role in education and particularly the discussion around training a skilled workforce. There’s a little less understanding of our role in producing a set of well-rounded graduates who are not only good workers but good citizens, and the role of the liberal arts. That’s an important thing to message.I think very few people, and this is not unique to Wisconsin at all, understand what the value to their state is of a big research university. And what research is, what that means as an enterprise and how that benefits the state is something that we really do need to talk a whole lot more about. We are the research one university in the state. Many states don’t even have a single really major, prominent research institution and this gives an advantage in all sorts of ways to the businesses in the state and the economic development in the state.We’ve got to be able to talk about that in ways that citizens can understand. I think the university hasn’t done a very good job of that. I don’t know that we’re doing a better job but we’re trying, even just raising it explicitly and talking about it.RB: A lot of it is most people in their lives have no contact with research, it’s not something that folks are familiar with. They don’t know what it is, they don’t know, when you say that a faculty member spends half of their time on research, they only teach two classes, they don’t know what that means. Whether that’s hard work or whether that’s staring out a window.So trying to tell stories, and I think [University Communications] has done, if you look at those regular stories on the front page of our website, they do a really good job of trying to talk about how does the research that we do here say something that’s of value to the world.To the state, to the nation, to the world, to some group and that type of outreach and work is important. And you’ve got to keep telling that because most of the time those people aren’t listening. You’ve got to keeping saying it so when they do listen, they can hear it.RB: I don’t know if there are disagreements. The system clearly wants to set an overarching policy. And then campuses will be able to write their own procedures as to how they are going to specifically carry out that policy. I admit that I would have hoped this would move forward a little faster because I would have loved to have this settled before we go fully into recruitment season here. But these things take time to do well and I suspect it will take us into the late winter or early spring.I remain very strongly hopeful and believe that we’re going to be able to write a policy both at a system level as well as at a Madison level that is strictly around tenure, fully consistent with all of the AAUP type requirements as to what a first rate university supposed to be doing in terms of protection of its tenured faculty, but that does respond to the changes that took place in state law this last spring.It’s a process and as people work through it they keep seeing new things, “Oh, we’ve got to work on this, or we’ve got to settle that.” And that just adds to the time. I know that the Faculty Senate on Monday is going to at least consider a proposal for this university. The tenure task force of the system is moving forward. My guess is that they will come up to some recommendations to the Regents again some time in the winter.After the Regents have passed that they will then turn to and consider individual campus proposals. A lot of faculty care very deeply, for good reasons, about the tenure protections at the university and this is going to continue to generate a lot of attention and a lot of press. It’s pretty inevitable.RB: So let me say, I don’t think they removed shared governance from state statute, they altered the shared governance in a way that basically weakened it but it’s not quite, we still have actually, compared to most other places, which have nothing, it’s still sort of strong.

I knew that there were discussions around tenure and whether the state was going to take that on as part of this budget cycle. I did not know whether they were going to end up doing that or not.So I can’t say that it was a complete surprise. I wish there had been more consultation with us upon doing that so that we could’ve worked a little more jointly. I do think what got us in the most trouble was that the Legislature opted to drop in this new language since they removed tenure, they had to put some sort of language in that covered tenure faculty from an HR perspective, right.And so they dropped in the same language that we had for staff. Had they consulted with any of us on that, we would have told them that that language wasn’t entirely appropriate, and it’s that language in particular about dismissal around program discontinuance, etc. that has caused the most problems and that was a problem that didn’t have to be caused had there actually been consultation.Budgets, they evolve rapidly, things get done late at night. Again, there’s nothing unusual about this process as a legislative process. I think there were some problems that we could have avoided had there been some more consultations in time and in advance notice.RB: Well again I want to talk about saving tenure, the Board of Regents almost immediately put into regental statute the same language that had been in state statute, thereby putting us on exactly the same playing field as virtually everyone of our peers, all of whom have these tenure statements in their regental statute.So, I don’t want to frame this as saving tenure. It’s the question of preserving tenure and state statute, as I say, I did not know in advance that that was going to happen in quite the way that it did. Once it happened, I don’t think there was a lot of opportunities to change it. The real question was how quickly was the System going to respond, and they responded almost immediately by putting into policy what had been in statute.We can have an argument about whether you’re better off with these things in state statute or whether you’re better off in your board of Regents policy. The legislative process is always strange and wonderful. As we learned, these things can be changed at any time. I don’t have any problems with this being in regental statute. Every university I’ve been at for my whole life up until now had this in regental statute, there were strong protections.The Regents are people who are around universities, they want to make sure that they are working effectively so. I’m not sure that putting this in regental statute gave us weaker tenure. The problem was around the language that was adopted in the budget and our need to then write regulations around that language. I realize that others can disagree with that and there are some faculty who really believe that state statute was a much stronger protection but, I would say, turned out not to be.RB: So let me talk about that because I think that hasn’t been fully understood. Comment number one is, in exchange for lifting that cap, and it’s waiving it for four years so this is an experiment, we made an incredibly strong commitment to students in the state of Wisconsin. We committed to admitting a minimum of at least 3,600 Wisconsin freshmen in our entering class every year. That is approximately as many as we’ve admitted last year, it is more than we admitted on average over the last ten years which I think was like 3,550.As the demographics of the state are shifting, and the number of high school students decline, the number of high school graduates in the state has declined by 10 percent in six years. It’s a huge decline. We will be admitting a larger and larger fraction of high school graduates at 3,600. So, not only have we made a commitment to being as strong as we had been, we made a commitment to being even stronger in the future. And we’re going to have to work to make sure that we attract the highest quality grads, so we don’t see quality decline.We’ve got more of the top students who apply to us but might end up going out of state, we want to them keep in-state, and keeping them in-state has all sorts of advantages for the state. So that was the commitment we made and in exchange for that, given declines in numbers of high school graduates, they therefore have lifted this cap. It is very hard as you look forward to say, for every out-of-state student you admit you have to admit three in-state because that gives you no room for expansion because the number of in-state students is declining out there. So I actually think that this is very strong protections for the state as well as giving us a little more flexibility if we’re going to grow some, to grow on the margin where there actually are more students instead of less students.RB: Yeah, and that’s a serious concern, and we obviously share that concern. Over the last 10 years, the university has grown by 600 students in terms of the freshmen class. You know over that time period, we’ve continued to see declines in time to graduation, increases in graduation rate, increases in retention rate between the freshmen and sophomore year.So there’s nothing, believe me, that says by growing some, you’re going to reduce your outcomes. In fact, as we have grown some, and not by a lot, our outcomes have steadily improved, and we’ve worked at that. And I intend to keep working at that and we’ve got a number of initiatives moving forward.So, the question is, how do we grow. We’ve got to pay attention to some of the big departments that have had a lot of students coming up and that will be a problem whether we are growing or not. The number of students taking chemistry has dramatically increased far beyond what would have happened even if we had had no growth whatsoever, chemistry lab availability would have been a problem. So those are problems we’ve got to solve in any case. And we’ve got to pay even more attention to them if we’re going to grow a little more on the margin.One way in which I hope to grow which doesn’t result in those problems, we have seen an increase in the number of transfer students from outside the state, seeking to come to Wisconsin, meaning that most of them are coming in their junior year. And of course that says that there’s very little pressure on the dorms, very little pressure on those big intro courses.So we do want to look at that population without in any way reducing our in-state transfers, asking whether we can expand our out-of-state transfers at the junior year point. Just because we’ve got an opportunity there of increased applications. But we’ve got to make sure we keep quality up in doing that. It’s a great way to expand without hitting exactly the problems you’re talking about. And this new policy allows us to take advantage of that.RB: So let me talk about the diversity issue. As you know, we raised out-of-state tuition this past year. And I have said this every time I’ve talked about it and people often don’t hear it, you always have to put up to 25% of any tuition increase back into scholarship aid. Because you have to guarantee that tuition increases don’t shut off your flow of lower income students, that’s just given. And similarly, if you’re going to expand out-of-state, you’ve got to make sure you’ve got the resources to keep attracting the diverse mix.Given what Wisconsin is and what Wisconsin looks like, a high share of our diversity comes from out-of-state. We work hard at in-state diversity but we have to attract out-of-state diversity if we want a Latino population here that is largely going to be out-of-state. Not entirely, but largely. We’re not Texas or Florida or California.One of the reasons why a little bit of expansion of out-of-state is good is it’s not just ethnic or racial diversity but diversity in terms of experiences and where people come from increase diversity. That type of diversity is an important part of the educational process. And it’s really one reason why virtually every university is quite committed to trying to admit diverse classes.I actually see the expansions in out-of-state admissions conditional on having the financial aid, which is a really important condition on the diversity front. One reason why we’re working so hard in the current fundraising campaign to increase scholarship aid is precisely that. If we’re going to try to increase our out-of-state admissions we need some more scholarship aid to keep the diversity in that group.I mean it’s absolutely the right questions to ask, and the best thing I can say is watch what we do on this one because we will be held accountable for the mix of students that we bring in and the access of this university to lower income students, both in-state and out-of-state.RB: I’m going to let Lori answer this but let me take a crack at it, because she’s very involved in trying to do some of the student programming that pulls people into this.Yea, I mean it was a fascinating moment in time particularly after the Tony Robinson death here in town and the number of people who became deeply involved in this issue and really putting time into it, clearly this was the issue on campus for many, many people in the community.As a university you’ve got to take notice of that in several ways. First of all, this is a teachable moment, we’re about teaching about society and what happens and finding ways to pull more people into this conversation is an important part and Lori was very involved in doing some of that.Secondly, when confronted with those sorts of big social problems, I think a university absolutely has to ask itself how are we involved, not just in teaching about this, but how are we involved in directly responding to and addressing these problems and we come back and talk about how are we engaged in schools here, how are we engaged in criminal justice and one of the things I feel good about this university is the number of ways in which we are in the community on a whole set of at least very closely related issues.Whether it is the work that we do in the South Park neighborhood in our sort of campus away from campus out there, we’ve got a location down there in one of the lower-income neighborhoods. Whether it’s the legal aid clinic that our law school runs or their Innocence Project.It was not by chance that we picked the Just Mercy as our readable book for this year. It wasn’t by chance that we had five times the crowd that we’ve ever had, I know that’s probably an overstatement, but a much bigger crowd, we’ve had some big crowds for our Go Big Read books, the crowd that night, we ended up turning I think 500 people away, told them to go home and look at it on there. We had multiple overflow rooms available and they weren’t enough.So I think one of the reasons people are still engaging in this, they understand this is an issue we need to know something about it and we need to be talking about it and thinking about how it affects us and how we can be part of the answer. That’s both taking advantage of the teachable moment, but also trying to push the question of what should we both as individuals and we as an institution be doing about this.Lori Berquam: I think one of the exciting things for me, and I think you probably also witnessed this, is just the level of conversation and discussion that ensued — in the classroom, outside the classroom, in forums, and I think that to me, that demonstrates the passion that we have to learn about this and what do we want to do about this.I think one of the things that we’re also excited about is the continual evolution of the diversity framework and how some of the things that we have been discussing will find their way in the diversity framework and will be part of our institution, our fabric, moving forward. I will say one of the things I appreciated was the level of passion and involvement in our students, and it’s what Madison is known for, so I was very happy to see it. I was also very happy to see how it led to productive conversations, and that it wasn’t destructive.And I hope those are continuing, I hope that now that we’re in a new year it’s not ending. And there’ve been conversations, you’ve probably been down to the [Multicultural Student Center] and have heard some of them that have transpired and others that are continuing around campus. The diversity forum is next week, where again, conversations will continue.I think the Just Mercy book was phenomenal, and I’ve heard from more students this year than ever, the number of classes that are engaging with that particular book and the conversation, the actual emotion that it’s also producing.RB: I think one of the larger questions, and this is a large social question to me. I don’t want to jump in to say “oh, what a great teachable moment” — you start by saying, why is it that we have to have tragedies before you create that type of mobilization, and create those sorts of moments. Because this grew out of the terrible tragedy of the death of a young man, who no one would’ve wished would’ve died, and of course many other young men and older men elsewhere around the country.I think one of the questions that should confront us in the midst of this is how do you mobilize against injustice of this sort, without having to have people die before it happens?LB: Before it’s an injustice, how do we all stand up? I will also say a couple of thing to take away that are continuing, our Multicultural Center students are working with UWPD to create a training video for new officers and continuing officers so it demonstrates both the partnership our police department has with the Multicultural Student Center and our students of color. But I think to the larger Madison community it really demonstrates also, the value that UW is offering here as a teaching ground, as a training opportunity.That’s only one example of others that are happening and I think are good indicators of our interest in continuing to keep this conversation alive and it is based out of a tragedy and it’s too bad that that has to happen.But now let’s make the most of that and help our campus and our students particularly, because you’re our future leaders. You’re the ones that’ll be out there long after we’re gone…leading the change that needs to happen.RB: As I’ve said, perhaps I shouldn’t say I’m surprised, I’m very disappointed in the survey, but they’re numbers that are reflected in other campuses across the country and what this survey gave us was much clearer evidence of at least certain aspects of who is most affected and where is a lot of this occurring.On the one hand there’s some of the larger issues, how do you get people engaged in this issue, it’s not unlike the last one we just talked about because it’s very clear that me making announcements saying that I don’t want any more sexual assault on campus will accomplish nothing, right?We have to engage the individuals who are part of the behavior and change behavior on the ground and some of that is an educational process with things like the Tonight video and I think we’ve done a lot of things on campus that I hope are helpful. But it’s clear we’ve got a big agenda in front of us so one of the things to come out of the survey is, there are a good number of incidents in the residence halls. Not just proportionate relative to the number of students who live there, but that says something about where we need to focus some attention and training and there are a number of incidents in the Greek System, I think we might have suspected that but now we have data on it.So we’ve gone out to the Greek community, and said to them, we want you to come to us with a set of proposals as to how you’re going to address this and let’s engage this conversation because you’ve got to own this. It’s not like we’re going to come to you and say you do this or you do that, and it’s one of the reasons one of the big focuses here is on interventionary behavior, the ‘It’s on Us’ type, as opposed to the ‘If you see something, say something,’ — If you see something, do something’ – you know, try to intervene. Keep someone else from getting in trouble if it looks like that’s happening, now that’s not always easy to do, there are a lot of incidents where there won’t be anyone else around, but this is one where behavior change is really hard.  To make progress on this, we’ve got to talk about behavior change, and whether that is abusive use of alcohol, which affects both the offenders and the victims, whether it is the view of sexuality and how you can take advantage of people in certain settings. What’s particularly striking and not a surprise to anyone who knows something about this issue is this is not stranger rape, of someone jumping out of the bushes. Now that did happen on the path here east of town, a horrible event, but that’s actually the less common form of sexual assault for women on this campus.It is students with students, and talking to people both about how you say no, to clearly hear it, how you say it and how you hear it and how you engage in conversation to not get to the point where it gets said and not heard is really important.LB: The thing that I think is most important is it’s going to take all of us, it’s not the administration saying do this or do that, it takes all of us working together.There are additional prevention opportunities, there are educational opportunities, there’s also policies that we have to continue to keep our eye on. There was a listening session on Monday for looking at our code of conduct. Do we have enough victim advocates to advocate for students who find themselves in this situation?All of those are opportunities, but we want it to be a partnership because I think that’s when it will be the strongest. It’s not that we go to the Greek community and say ‘ok well do this’ because that may or may not be the right thing. But, what is the right thing, is that we come at this together.And that bystander component or “stand upper” component, I don’t know what the correct term is, that’s critical. It’s not just in the instance or in the heat of the situation. That’s before that even gets there, to engage in conversations about how we treat each other with respect, how we’re able to communicate our needs, how we’re also able to confront each other and say ‘hey that is a degrading joke about women’ or ‘that is racist’ or ‘that’s homophobic.’ All of that feeds into a climate of sexual violence, and that’s the systemic part of this that we want to have addressed.RB: And that’s hard.LB: Well first of all let me say that the Greek life really stepped up and have had more meetings than anyone else in wanting to address this issue. So I applaud their efforts, their risk management team, their new member education all have been groups that have been meeting about this topic and have heard and reviewed all of the statistics and now we’re in that formation of what can we do? What would make the most sense to do?We know that they’re very interested in doing another level of training — what does that training look like? Because, in reality, through the conversations that we have, it’s not necessarily Greeks doing this to other Greeks. Frankly, it’s maybe people who aren’t Greek, who want to maybe try to belong to our campus and go to the Greek community, and then find themselves in that situation. So, that training piece probably has multiple sides to it.RB: And I do want to give a shout out to some of our athletes in trying to promote the right messages on campus. And athletes do have a visibility on campus that many other athletes don’t. And I’ve been really pleased to see that as well.LB: And I know our band is interested in doing the same thing, so, it’s clear to me, similar to what we’ve been talking about in the Tony Robinson situation, our campus is ready to take action.RB: So I think this has to be a both/and. We have every intention of continuing the education and the focus around alcohol abuse and around sexual assault.But adding to that, some specific focus in areas that we know are particular problem areas around campus as well as talking about the behavior, the bystander interventions. I guess it’s all of the above. What makes this complex is that there’s never any silver bullet that changes behavior. Different people hear things in different ways, there’s some people who look at that Tonight video and ‘wow’ and ‘well we won’t do that’ and some people who just, it goes in one ear and out the other.And that’s where having multiple conversations matter. So one of the things I know Lori was talking about was doing more of those conversations, particularly in the residence halls, so it’s not just you watch the Tonight video in the first week but there’s follow-up, in a number of ways, in later weeks.LB: Right, so what we know is that we offer the Tonight video and that’s before students even get here to campus. So once they’re here on campus we want to have a second opportunity to understand what sexual assault really means and what it looks like once you’re really here. So, that’s one of the things we’re doing in the residence halls.The other thing we’re doing in the residence halls, specifically, or what we will be doing in the fall is, and we did a great job this year in training our student staff and housefellow staff in how to address situations both as they may see them sort of spiraling, but also then how to be an advocate and how to be there, as a resource for students who find themselves in that situation.And that’s a combination, as the Chancellor said, of both educating the residents and the students, but it’s also making sure that we have that net of support. So should something happen, the staff are trained, and highly trained, to be able to respond.Can I add one other thing, just because this is something that I’m very passionate about. Are you familiar with Badger Step-Up? So that’s a program that all student organizations have to send two of their members of their executive board or their leadership team to participate in to be a recognized student organization.Right now it focuses on leadership and there’s some alcohol components, there’ll be another module next year that will be about sexual violence, sexual assault. intimate partner violence as another module to that. Do we move this into ‘every single student?’ We don’t really have the capacity yet to do that, but it’s one of the things that we hope that student organizations, and we have a thousand of them, will actually engage their members to talk about this.Whether it’s the chess club or whether it’s campus crusade, every group should be talking about this. I know we had some campus ministers do a sermon about sexual assault in their church, to the participants of the church and we had great conversation.And I would hope that we can also look to the newspaper for that sort of community buy in and having those conversations, using the information from the climate survey to engage in the discussion and continue the discussion.BH: Our issue last week was actually fully centered on sexual assault and sexual violence.RB: Yes, I read that. I thought it was a good issue.RB: I don’t think there’s anyone on a college campus that doesn’t look at those shootings and say, but for the grace of God, that could happen here at any moment. As I have said, I am absolutely opposed to allowing concealed handguns into classrooms, into dorms, into Camp Randall.I should note there is no specific piece of legislation yet, so we do not have language. There’s simply an intent to to co-sponsor. So we are waiting for a bill to drop to know exactly what’s in it.But UWPD, a number of groups around campus, a number of groups around the System and other schools I think have almost uniformly expressed their dismay. My hope is that if there is a bill that comes forward that looks like it could go somewhere that we would also be able to mobilize parents, because I think parents may be one of the most critical voices here in the state.I’m the mother of a sophomore at Northwestern University. I wouldn’t send her to a school where she could end up in dorm room where someone with someone with a gun in the room, I just wouldn’t do that. And I can’t be the only parent who feels that way about safety on campus particularly given the sort of shooting incidents, combined with the problems that we and every other campus have on alcohol abuse, on large crowds.Imagine Halloween night out there on State Street with people, more people with guns than currently have them. And, this is one that we have to talk very directly with our legislators and mobilize as many voices as we can to talk about the potential risks that we’re running.LB: Every student I’ve talked to has been like ‘Seriously, I could be sitting on a bus next to a student with a gun in the bag?’ Every student I’ve talked to has been in disbelief.RB: And faculty have concerns, our mental health staff who deal with students in crisis have concerns, the UWPD, everyone who works at games and is part of athletic events. This is one, I must say, defies common sense.RB: We started in planning this campaign literally on my first day here. And we had two years of the “quiet phase” before public launch. So yes this started well before last year’s budget and there are all sorts of reasons to do this regardless of budget because the gifts by alumni, by and large, are not gifts that go to replace state dollars.In fact, very few donors want to give to something that was funded by the state. They want to give to something that would not happen, adds to events, programs or students on campus that is somewhat unique and they can say ‘look, I did that.’ You often think about alumni fundraising as a margin of excellence: it lets you support internship programs, study abroad, or help researchers through faculty named chairs, they have money that can start their research before it’s ready to go out for grant proposal, things that are important for the functioning of the university but are add-ons to the classic things you can spend tuition or state dollars on, or federal research dollars for that matter.There isn’t an institution of higher education in the country that isn’t pursuing alumni fundraising as a major part of their financial plan. You think about it as four legs to the stool of the finances of the university. Of the public university, state dollars, tuition dollars, federal research dollars and alumni private giving at a big research place. And this campaign is about encouraging donors to find things on campus they are passionate about that they can add to the margin of excellence. They can do something that wouldn’t otherwise happen.In all of my experience with fundraising, nobody wants to give to a university whose funds are going downhill. Everybody wants to be a part of a winner. There’s an enormous synergy between state funding and private fundraising. If the state is investing the university, that makes our alumni even more excited about investing here because they have the sense that this is a place on the rise, this is a place going places and this is a place I’m going to put some of my money.So I think about the state and fundraising dollars as synergistic, as complementary to each other, they’re not substitutes. And indeed if the state continues to pull money away from us, it will make fundraising from private donors even harder.Budget problems of this past year have made it even more obvious that private fundraising has to be part of our set of tools about financing the university, but I don’t want people to think about private fundraising as we’re substituting these dollars for state dollars because we largely can’t do that. That’s not what our alumni are good to pay for. You couldn’t run a university on that basis. It’s why you have to have state, tuition, federal research dollars.Alumni fundraising lets you do things you can’t do with those other dollars, they don’t substitute for them. I’m not going to get an alumni to help me paint the walls and sweep the floors, fix the steam pipes and even pay my basic faculty for introductory courses. That is the job of other funds.RB: Well there’s a question of why would you want to cut the budgets. I really did see what was happening in terms of budget cuts this year. I think it’s not very related at all to the fundraising campaign issues.We had a very tight budget in this state. We were in hot for almost $700 million on the Medicaid front, we had huge transportation needs and the transportation trust fund was in serious problems and so they did a lot of borrowing to deal with that. There had been a variety of tax reductions and the forecast for the revenues that were going to come in were coming in a little under forecast.So all of that meant that it was just a really tight budget year, they didn’t have the money and had to make some really tough choices. They were going to have to cut a bunch of things, which they did, and that included higher education. Did we get a little bit bigger cuts than I wish we would have? Yes. I think the main driver of those cuts was just a crummy budget year all around, it wasn’t like it was a great budget year. We got cut like a number of other agencies. All state agencies got cut this year. I realize that a $250 million cut sounds dreadful, and it is, but it could’ve been much worse.We started with what was a $300 million cut plus another $50 million that wasn’t part of that base cut but was cut elsewhere in the budget. So we started by sitting on almost a $350 million cut and that got reduced down to $250 so that was a big win in many ways. And in part because so many people rode in and talked about the negative impacts of those cuts on the universities.RB:  It’s always more difficult when you have a major leader in the state running for president because you get caught up in the politics of presidential primaries. And of course throughout the spring Gov. Walker was doing very well in the Iowa polls and there were a lot of people in the state Legislature who wanted to make sure they were seen supporting him. They thought that was the right thing to do both for his campaign and the state. That made a lot of discussions more difficult.Whether it’s Gov. Walker or Gov. Doyle, you just don’t want to be caught up in presidential primary politics because it puts everything through a different lens than the sole question of ‘what should we be doing here in the state?’It also gets caught up in how it affects the presidential election and it just made it a much more complex budget year and a harder budget year as a result.RB: Those plans are not very complete at this point. It’s very unclear at this point, so I admit I do not want to make any comments related to current proposals in the primary races.RB: So we actually have a pretty clear admissions process here which does not just involve athletics. The admissions decision, the admissions office makes decisions on candidates and sends them, and athletics obviously has a list of candidates.This is true of a variety of schools — our music program for instance — often times very interested in recruiting people with particular talents and so if people apply, once the admissions decisions are made, those names are sent back to the departments that have interest in those individuals.Those individuals can call for what is called an admissions conference to sit down with a set of admissions officers and talk about the case and what this individual will bring to campus and basically plead their case and the Athletics Department can do this, the music department can do this.There are a couple of other places where there are particular talents that don’t always necessarily get fully vetted in the admissions process where they come back into these sorts of conversations. That conversation takes place and the admissions office makes a final decision. The final decision is always in the admissions office. I think in the vast majority of cases that are pled, end up with the individual being admitted. But not always. And I have to say I hire very good professional admissions professionals. I’m very impressed with that office and at the end of the day you trust their judgement.RB: I don’t know that I think there are problems in terms of communications between the two. I meet with Barry Alvarez at least once a month. We often see each other multiple times in between that. There’s regular communication between his staff and our staff whether it’s on admissions or on regulatory standards or on licensing. There’s lots and lots of regular communications between what happens in the bowels of athletics and what happens in the bowels of other offices around Bascom and elsewhere.I actually think we work together pretty well. Are there occasional tensions? Yes, as there are between us and the chemistry department, and us and student aid and us and communications.Our Athletic Department, I will say, I think has done, compared to almost any of our peers, a superb job of being a first rate competitor. We do really well. Having students who perform well academically, our football team last year, this didn’t get enough press, was the top rated football team in terms of academic performance in Division I. They were better than Stanford, they were better than Duke.In the Division I schools, we came out on top academically with our football team. And you know, we had a pretty good run. And we have had a clean program. We have not had NCAA violations for over a decade. And on top of all of those, the Athletic Department returns money back to the university which is also a rarity among our peers. So I have great appreciation for that department for what it does and for how it performs.LB: I would just add that they have always stepped up — It’s On Us campaign, the You Can Play campaign, LGBT, Badgers Give Back. They have really stepped up and are very willing to always partner with others on campus and in the community I think to demonstrate the strength that they offer and the pride they have in being Badgers as well.LB: Actually voter ID because that seems to be something that garnering a great deal of interest. And just so you know, the cost of reproducing our IDs, because we have access control which other campus like UW Oshkosh don’t, and would necessitate a student getting those done every two years, because that’s the date of expiration for a voter ID, would potentially mean a student wouldn’t have access to their debit cards.So let’s just say they forget to get it, because you know, who looks at the expiration date on their ID, and you forget to get it and you’re in a hurry, and suddenly you can’t get into the library, you can’t get any food, you can’t get into Rec Sports.RB: And it’s probably that there’s a real cost to this and we’re talking about millions of dollars of producing a new ID and reproducing it every two years for students. There are also real best practices about what you want on a student ID particularly a student ID that’s a debit card and that has access into buildings across campus. And best practices say that you do not put a picture and a signature on it, which we would have to do as part of the voter ID.I think we have all decided pretty clearly that our best option is to issue separate voter ID cards starting immediately, I think we’re already doing this. Every person who has to go get a new ID, which of course is going to be one-fourth of our campus by next fall because all the new students coming in, when they get that ID will be asked, “Would you also like a voter ID? We can produce one for you immediately.”And anyone else who walks in will get this, we’ve really ramped up before an election, there’s an April election. There’s obviously going to be a November election. So that we can handle lots of students, we’ll be open that weekend before the election. I think we’re in as good of shape as we can be and I feel pretty comfortable. The voter ID laws in this country in this state changed. They’ve made it harder to vote. That’s a fact. But I think we’ve done, we’re doing, everything that we can to try to make sure that students who want to vote know exactly what has to happen to get the things to them that they need.

In an opinion piece for The Black Voice, Rep. Tyriek Mack, who authored and co-sponsored the legislation, compared this phrase with the university’s inability to act on actual change to provide an inclusive environment.ASM supports sexual assault survivors, undocumented students on campus
The Associated Students of Madison stood in solidarity with sexual assault survivors and undocumented students at the University of Wisconsin Read…“Ultimately, the inclusive rhetoric propagated by these white supremacist institutions have little real meaning,” Mack said in the op-ed.Now, Mack said “Cognitive Dissonance” will compel the university to move toward action.According to a statement from ASM, the list of demands include:Within the legislation, Mack and co-sponsors Rep. Omer Arain and Rep. Katherine Kerwin pointed to the achievement gap between majority and underrepresented students as one means to reconsider admissions criteria and offer free access to UW for all black people.“If no one challenges the university’s empty promises, then the racial composition of campus will remain stagnant,” Mack said.But UW spokesperson Meredith McGlone said in an email to The Badger Herald that the university has done more than simply talk about diversity.“We’ve increased the proportion of students of color from 11 to 15 percent over the past decade,” she said. “We’ve been recognized nationally for our work closing the graduation gap between majority and underrepresented students.”McGlone also noted the university has increased need-based aid through programs such as the $100 million Nicholas match and the $10 million Chancellor’s Scholars match.When it comes to the application process, McGlone said a Board of Regents policy specifically notes undergraduate applications must be accompanied by either an ACT or SAT score. This approach is consistent with other Big Ten universities, she said.The university shares ASM’s goals of increasing the number underrepresented students on campus, she said, but questioned the student government’s methods and its legality.“It’s unclear that the methods that they’re suggesting are either legal or the best approach to accomplishing those goals,” McGlone said.__________Feb. 16, 11:45 a.m.: This post has been updated to include information from UW communications.

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2015/03/02/good-kids-puts-rape-culture-center-stage-at-university-theatre/,"Mar 2, 2015","A girl arrives at a party. She is drunk. She is flirty. She is wearing a skirt raised high above her knees and a top exposing her midriff. Is she asking for it?The University’s Theatre’s production of the play “Good Kids” brings this uncomfortable but college-relevant question, and many others, to the surface.“Good Kids,” which will run Thursday through Sunday of next weekend, is a contemporary play which addresses a situation that can be constituted as rape. It prompts the audience to think deeply about sexual assault and its impact on the campus community.“It is challenging because no matter how many times you hear stories like these we always think of it as happening someplace else, to someone else,” University Theatre director Olivia Dawson said. “But, statistically, it is happening right under our noses but just isn’t being talked about.”University of Wisconsin’s University Theatre was required to perform the show, alongside the other 13 schools in the Big Ten, as part of the Big Ten Theatre Consortium’s recent efforts acknowledging the underrepresentation of women in the theatre community.Big Ten Theatre chairs decided to create an equal opportunity for women by commissioning a different female playwright over three-year periods. They are to write a production containing a large number of female roles and based on a contemporary issue that college students can relate to.Author and head playwright at University of California, San Diego, Naomi Iizuka was the first playwright commissioned by the Big Ten Theatre. “Good Kids” is her creation.“I wanted to write a play that spoke to issues that were very important to university students right now,” Iizuka said.Iizuka based “Good Kids” off the true story of the highly-publicized rape scandal in Steubenville, Ohio in 2012. It explores the story of a small town where high school football players are treated like celebrities. A high school student, Chloe (Isabel Cuddihy), gets drunk at a party and is taken advantage of by a group of football players. Meanwhile, embarrassing and shocking photos and a video about the night’s events are posted to various social media outlets. Throughout the show, the characters grapple with the question of whether or not the event can be classified as rape, and consequently if the boys should face any consequences.Moments in the play were purposefully written to make the audience feel uncomfortable and force onlookers to think critically about what is happening.“We want to make it real for [the audience], because [then] they can relate to it,” cast member Francesca Atian (Brianna) said. “We want to project reality in front of them so that they can put themselves in that situation, so they can see themselves in the characters, so they can identify with the characters and see what they can do to improve themselves.”“Good Kids” also displays the powerful message of how we value others. It gives audiences a realistic portrayal of the modern day teenage world where social media and YouTube can expose anything and everything that occurs in daily life.“This play has taught me so much about how we interact with each other, how we all interact with our peers and how we are distanced from each other given modern technology,” Atian said.Dawson has similar thoughts to Atian when reflecting on “Good Kid’s” theme of technology in modern day society.“I want people to realize that we are devoting more feeling and emotion to the machines that keep us connected rather than the people with whom we say we are connected. I want people to ask themselves: Is being so connected to my technology eroding my humanity?” Dawson said.The members of cast and crew made it clear this production is much different than any other that they have participated in before. There is a clear and important message actors are trying to relay.Cast member Ethan Larson (Connor) said he hopes the audience can clearly understand the message and their perspective, and find it powerful because it is an important topic that no one thinks about unless it personally affects them. Whether or not something like this has happened to an audience member, the content of the play is eye-opening and can make a significant impact on one’s mind, evoking the thought: “That could happen to me.”“‘Good Kids’ is a story that needs to be told and it needs to be told now,” Dawson said. “Hopefully, people will watch with both an open mind and an open heart.”",‘Good Kids’ puts rape culture center-stage at University Theatre,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2019/11/05/where-winter-coats-and-income-inequality-intersect/,"Nov 5, 2019","Winter in Madison came early this year. With snowfall in October, students and staff had to dig into winter clothing that was still confidently packed away. As a result, winter gear is already being worn around campus.As puffy coats and jackets grow in numbers with each drop in degree, inequality is becoming more and more visible by the brands the University of Wisconsin community wears. As such, income inequality and discrimination become more visible during the winter months in Madison.To be clear, this is not a new concept: student papers and larger publications have repeatedly written about how winter gear brands have negative social effects. One EdgeEffects article about UW quoted a handful of articles from The Badger Herald about winter coats and stereotyping.It feels necessary to reopen this discussion with the new context of the Homecoming scandal. In the early 2000s, writers chose to focus on the divide between “coasties” and “sconnies” on our campus. Coasties is a term for Badgers from the east and west coast who are generalized as wearing Canada Goose coats and leggings. The Sconnie stereotype describes people from Wisconsin as consumers of cheaper brands and Wisconsin apparel.In the interest of community safety, UW must re-evaluate conditions for school closure
Sunday night, the University of Wisconsin’s Twitter account stated that despite the impending winter storm, classes would be in session Read…The coasties-sconnies scuffle is extremely elementary and immature, and by continuing to publicize the terms, it only hands down stereotypes to every new class of UW students. The heart of the issue isn’t east vs. west coast — it’s income inequality and lack of diversity. As the Homecoming scandal made clear, this school is not diverse. At UW, 76 percent of students are white, and the median household income is $71,185 per year — significantly higher than the U.S. media income of $61,937. Consequently, minority students and low-income students are easily marginalized and overlooked. While the university has engaged in a vigorous PR campaign to rebuild its public image, students are also to blame for the campus climate.Through social media, social norms, and in all honesty, a general lack of attention and sensitivity, students collectively have not taken a stance against racism and income inequality at UW. While there are many individual organizations doing work to advocate for marginalized groups, the student body should be active in preventing stereotypes and cultural biases from growing.Sconnies, Coasties unite!
We have a very divided campus at the University of Wisconsin. I’m not referring to race, political views or sexual Read…Winter coats are expensive, which makes them such an obvious symbol of wealth. Canada Goose and Moncler coats cost upwards of $750. Some high schools have noticed the unhealthy social consequences that these costly products can create. One high school referred to the issue as “poverty shaming,” and noted that students put economic pressure on their parents to buy them the most expensive products just to fit in.Owning an expensive winter coat is not a crime. But not owning one should not come with social consequences. Come wintertime, high-end coat brands become symbols of affluence, and it is easy to feel insecure when a large portion of students seem to have one.Winter is right around the corner, heightening need for homelessness support
Governor Tony Evers gave his support to bills aimed to help homeless people through additional funding for various social programs, Read…What should be done about this?First, UW students need to get educated. We go through hours of drug/alcohol and sexual assault training, which is obviously crucial. But economic discrimination is just as prominent on such a homogeneous campus. That also needs to be hammered home.Second, with education comes social change. Winter coat brands should not be relevant when discussing student identities. By dismantling stereotypes that revolve around clothing or where one comes from, we can dedicate more energy to building an inclusive campus culture.So, if you’ve read this far, you are likely interested and frustrated about the campus and winter climate. In that case, be the change and hold yourself and peers accountable by not contributing to negative social norms. One by one, we can create the inclusive environment that should already be in place.Emma Axelrod (eaxelrod@wisc.edu) is a sophomore studying political science and journalism.",Where winter coats and income inequality intersect,UWM

He has decided to strike a deal with the government in an attempt to reduce his sentence.Daniel Hernandez, more popularly known under his rapper name Tekashi 6ix9ine, has pleaded guilty to a variety of charges including conspiring to murder. The bulk of 6ix9ine’s testimony consists of him pointing out members of his former gang, the Nine Trey Bloods.Federal prosecutors are using 6ix9ine as their primary witness in an attempt to convict the other five codefendants in the case.Judge rules rape crisis advocate may testify in Cephus trial

He is no stranger to the courtroom, but 6ix9ine now has a very different role in a case as the government’s star witness.A federal courtroom can be an intimidating prospect, and 6ix9ine is receiving special treatment due to him being in considerable danger because he’s testifying against a popular gang.According to Lisa Evers a reporter who was at the trial on Hot 97, he was brought in through a different tunnel than witnesses normally come through, and is being held in a separate part of the prison. 6ix9ine had no problems pointing out people he was previously affiliated with and calling them out as members of a criminal organization.Trial set for homeless man accused of killing UW student studying abroad in Rome
A trial date has been set for Massimo Galioto, an Italian homeless man accused of killing University of Wisconsin student Read…Perhaps most humorously, 6ix9ine also testified that various rappers, including Cardi B, Trippie Redd, and Jim Jones were gang members.The severity of these allegations remains to be seen considering some of these rappers themselves have not shied away from claiming themselves as being bloods.The prosecution is making some headway in their case with 6ix9ine as their witness, and his testimonies have led to two of his former crew members, Anthony Ellison and Aljermiah Mack, to being convicted of racketeering.Ellison was also convicted of kidnapping and assaulting 6ix9ine, something that 6ix9ine had been publicly speaking about for sometime, and there was even a videotape of the incident posted on youtube. Mack was convicted of distributing narcotics.6ix9ine’s transformation from his boisterous gangster persona to a star witness is one of the most radical changes popular music has ever seen.Many rappers, including Snoop Dogg and The Game have called out 6ix9ine, labeling him a snitch and condemning his actions. Many people on twitter have humorously labeled Martha Stewart as more “gangsta” than 6ix9ine because she accepted her prison sentence in 2003 without ratting anyone out.‘Inherently violent’: The problem with the prison system is its very existence
Wisconsin has inexcusable racial disparities in its prison system and more prisoners than it knows what to do with. For Read…Following the trial, a variety of memes surfaced and began to trend, saying random people like Tony Hawk or Barack Obama is a member of the Nine Trey Bloods. The memes alluded to the fact that 6ix9ine looped in quite a few people with the gang, and bringing popular rappers into the mix was enough to catch many people’s attention. The internet couldn’t get enough of the trial, as it was frequently reported on across a wide variety of popular media platforms.While most people have taken to calling 6ix9ine a snitch and disapproved of his actions, some have come to his defense and said that given his situation, they would go on the stand to lower their sentence as well.Facing up to life in prison after being threatened and kidnapped by your own management team is not a great situation to be in, and some think that 6ix9ine’s snitching is warranted.That being said, there is no doubt that 6ix9ine put himself in this situation to begin with, and had he not gotten involved with the Nine Trey Bloods simply to bolster his image, he would not have to testify in order to reduce his sentence in the first place.Editorial Board: #HomeIsWhereWIArent — a hard truth, a call to action for media

The Multicultural Student Center hosted a feast to kick off Native American Heritage Month. Additionally, the event served as a Read…Ludwig recalled an incident a few years ago at the Dejope fire circle when students yelled stereotypical “war chants” out of their dorm windows during a ceremony for missing and murdered indigenous women.Last year on Indigenous Peoples’ Day — which deliberately coincides with Columbus Day — someone also vandalized the Dejope fire circle by spray painting “Columbus Rules 1492.”Ludwig said the university partnered with the Ho-Chunk nation in building that space. But after this incident, Ludwig said the university responded with a “cookie-cutter apology.”“We have to deal with racism from students and faculty members and that’s constantly on our minds,” Ludwig said. “We have to think about that and deal with it and take a lot of time from ourselves — especially emotional time and emotional labor.”UW spokesperson Meredith McGlone said the university is taking steps to improve campus climate for Native students and other underrepresented groups. Recently, the university launched the Elders-in-Residence program, which brings Native community leaders to campus.Panel discusses UW’s shortfalls in supporting indigenous students

The panel featured UW alumni like UW Native American student success coordinator Sasanehsaeh Pyawasay.“These structures weren’t built for native folks,” Pyawasay said.“These higher education and high schools were originally built for wealthy white men. So how do you navigate in that space and help bring students along — particularly native students?”To help Native students navigate through culture shock at the university, Pyawasay said there needs to be more of an effort to build community.“We’re all different, we all come from different communities and different families — but this is an opportunity for you to really get together and learn about each other,” Pyawasay said.Fellow panelist and Menominee tribal legislator Gary Besaw said that while he often speaks with humor, that doesn’t dismiss the fact that Native people have had to live through many atrocities.Vukmir campaign’s use of ‘Pocahontas’ epithet shows she won’t represent WI

After asking what’s changed since 2016 to the students in the audience, Denning was met with silence.But in response, Alpha Pi Omega vice president Melissa Besaw said she too felt lost when she came to UW. It led her to the sorority and Wunk Sheek where she found a strong support group of Native students.“I found a lot of support in these organizations,” Melissa Besaw said. “But I think it depends on the students that are in leadership, but I would say now that there’s a definite improvement.”SSFC approves Wunk Sheek budget, hears Live Free presentation

UHS also plans to recruit mental health providers with experience in working with Native students.While it’s admirable that Native students were able to build spaces for themselves, Pyawasay said this responsibility shouldn’t fall on the students who are simply at the university to gain an education. Instead, staff and faculty should be the ones to improve the campus climate for Native students.The Multicultural Student Center has hired an undergraduate campus community organizer to help coordinate communication and community among Native students, McGlone said.“There are other things on our mind that we need to worry about,” Ludwig said. “That should be taken into account, and that wasn’t the case for Isabel.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2014/10/06/transcript-interview-with-uws-rebecca-blank-and-lori-berquam/,"Oct 6, 2014","The Badger Herald and The Daily Cardinal last week interviewed University of Wisconsin Chancellor Rebecca Blank and Dean of Students Lori Berquam on a range of issues, from alcohol policy and sexual assault to tuition and diversity.Below is a transcript of the conversation, which has been edited for style and clarity.The Badger Herald: I wanted to start out with a survey you sent out last year on academic integrity, wondering what you learned from the survey and what kind of action are you taking on it, if any?Lori Berquam: One of the things we learned from the academic integrity survey is, well, probably no surprise that there’s probably a lot more questions about what is academic integrity, what does it actually … what is contained within it. And then one of the other areas is really looking at a focus on our international students who come here with an entirely different mindset about academic integrity. What you will see is that there’s a new video up on the ISS [International Student Services] website about academic integrity and helping to explain it and explain the expectations we have here in the U.S. about academic integrity in classroom and in research and in the work that our students do.So that’s probably the primary outcome. The other thing that we learned is I think there is quite a lot of variation in what faculty holds students accountable for. So we’ve been working with our faculty to talk about what UWS 14 has in the code for what they can do with students who are found to be responsible for violating the academic integrity code of conduct. So those are probably the primary things.BH: Any other things that you found concerning in there?LB: Well, again, probably not of surprise to you, the number of students who self report that they have cheated or somehow found another way to get an answer on an exam. We were also really pleased at the number of students who believed that measures were being taken to mitigate that, whether it’s in alternating tests, seating charts, different ways in which the tests were produced or not reproduced were also really good pieces of the information that we were able to discern. One of my staff members would be very willing, though, to walk you through the entire assessment and all of the information that was gleaned from it and how we’re actually using it moving forward.The Daily Cardinal: I have a question about sexual assault on campus. It’s recently been a hot topic, I think, both here and nationwide. I know that UW recently joined the “It’s On Us” campaign to help combat that and spread awareness and prevention. What other steps are being taken? Specifically, I know that California recently passed a bill, it’s called “Yes Means Yes” that requires … positive verbal consent … instead of just lack of resistance or silence. So in light of that, would you support legislation like that here and what kinds of other steps do you think will be taken in the future in order to help prevent sexual assaults? LB: Right now there’s a lot of legislation being proposed. If you’re familiar with the Campus Accountability and Security Act, CASA, as we call it, that’s also out there being proposed. There’s also legislation that hasn’t yet actually been in place, and it goes into place in November so the guidance on how to actually apply it to our campuses, we don’t even have the guidance on that yet. One of the things I would say is I think we need to see how many things are in place before we … Because they’re almost starting to contradict each other. And so for me in terms of additional legislation, I’d kind of like it to sort of maybe slow down just a little bit and make sure the why we’re doing it is as important as the what we’re doing.I’m often asked about the numbers about sexual assault. The numbers to me, after we’ve reached one, it’s already too many. So, after that, it doesn’t matter because one is too many. And how do we create a campus culture, a campus environment, where we are asking for consent, and consent is what’s sought, not the absence of a no but the presence of a yes. So to go directly to the heart of your question, the legislation in California, I think that there is some real value in the discussion that is being kind of connected to that bill. I think the bottom line [is] regarding how do we create community, and how are we effectively communicating with each other? Recognizing that alcohol has played a role and how do we make sure that when there is sex involved that consent is connected to any sex that ensues. I think consent has to be at the core of what we do. The other parts of the legislation are really about those numbers and reporting, and what information and training is also out there. You know, we were on the cutting edge before it was required to do “Tonight,” and we’ve done “Tonight” for a couple of years.State, campus officials turn their attention to preventing sexual assaults
When it comes to sexual assault on college campuses, increased numbers of incident reports can be a good sign; it Read…Rebecca Blank: You can’t be at any big institution like this without worrying about what is happening on the sexual assault front. The numbers are horrifying at the national level. We know there is underreporting. Our desire to both reduce the number of incidents as well to when horrific things happen, to really give people support in a way that helps them and deals with the issue. It’s got to be a high priority.I have the sense that this university was doing a very good job, but there are always things you can do better … We are in the midst of expanding the training, for instance, we were really focusing on training for people who are in touch with undergraduates. We need to focus this as well on people who are in touch with graduate students, and … have more inclusive training across campus beyond just groups that we’ve been working with. Lori’s office has recently hired another full time investigator, stepped up their investigative abilities.There’s a number of things that we are looking at because we want to do as good a job as possible on this front. In terms of a lot of national proposals, and I will say this as sort of the empiricist, you really want a little evidence as to what works and doesn’t work in terms of either discouraging bad things from happening or encouraging people to report or giving them better support. And there are a lot of proposals out there where we just have no evidence for. … You really sort of [would] like to try at least a little bit of experimenting when you implement this in a few places and see where it works and doesn’t work and what happens. There are a lot of people of real valid concern jumping into this with sort of broad and sweeping proposals that … cause extensive changes, and I’d like to do that only if I had some evidence.The “Tonight” video, there’s actually real evidence that certain types of engagement with this material makes a difference. it actually adds to education and it changes behavior. The “Yes Means Yes” law, I think we don’t have that … and probably because it’s really hard to monitor, right? This is a law that is hard to implement and enforce.There’s a lot of ways in which you want to communicate about consent. I’m absolutely with Lori. Consent is at the center of reducing the amount of sexual assault. But I just don’t know whether that is the right way to go or not because we don’t have any real evidence as to whether that type of regulation is any more effective than trying to talk broadly in the way the “Tonight” video does, or other forms of more immediate engagement with a single individual, whether it’s online or in person, may have bigger effects than a sweeping law that says, “You must behave this way” in a very personal and private setting where no one’s watching, right?BH: As a follow up to that, a lot of the discussion and the discourse around sexual assault has recently led back to Greek life. I know the Cardinal just published an editorial about it this morning, and then with UW-Milwaukee and even the Guardian wrote one with a rather controversial statement of ‘Should we just ban all Greek life?” How big of an influence does that have in initiatives the university is taking? And I know there were some proposals of pushing back rushing for Greek life that sparked some controversy.RB: Well, let me start out, and I’ll let Lori finish on this one, we have some wonderful fraternities and sororities here that do service in the community that never get in trouble in any way. I really wouldn’t want to tar Greek life as the problem. There are problems in some individual organizations, and that’s what we need to focus on, not on Greek life in general because there’s a number of people from Greek life. It’s just been a great community that’s wonderful to have on campus in a whole variety of ways.That said, there are some organizations here that have been more problematic than others, and a lot of those problems are around alcohol. The abuse of alcohol is so highly correlated with sexual assault issues, with being the victim of a crime, with health-related problems and with poor performance in dropping out and not completing your academic work. I think we’re very concerned with places that have had multiple incidents of abusive alcohol or breaking the underage drinking laws, not following the rules, and there have been a number of changes that have actually been implemented this year to try to create more visibility around the fact that we are watching and monitoring, and Lori can talk about some of the stuff that we have implemented this fall.LB: I want to wholeheartedly concur in terms of, I don’t want to make any broad sweeping generalizations. We don’t like that of any particular body or entity, and so I certainly wouldn’t want that out there regarding Greek life. I do think that there are pockets of concern, and hopefully we’re able to zero in on them, focus on them and increase and hopefully make them more valuable parts of our community.What we have started is an initiative that is really a soft initiative. And I hesitate to focus on this because what happens then is when I talk about the first 45 days then people say, “Well what happens on day 46?” But the idea is that the first six weeks of a student’s experience here, particularly a new student, is one that we want to make sure that we’re paying close attention to. The research out there demonstrates that it’s in those first six weeks when a student finds affinity here, gets connected here, makes friends here, feels like they can academically succeed here, all of those along with, now let’s get involved in the culture that is Madison, oftentimes involving alcohol.So we have stepped up the alternative options for students to do things outside of going to a house party or to any other type of party involving alcohol. In fact, the chancellor is calling bingo next Thursday night from 8 to 10 p.m. I called the first bingo, and it was a blast, by the way. I think that these efforts along with working with residence halls, along with working with local liquor stores and the Madison police and the UW police, working together to address these issues so that we don’t get to the point of dangerous behavior.The transports to detox, the alcohol content via breathalyzer being above a .3. You know, .08 is the legal limit, if you’re legal to drink, and you’re driving. Beyond that it gets really concerning in terms of your health and well-being and the impact on your academics, the impact on your social life. We want a campus where students can have a Wisconsin experience that’s free from the negative impacts of alcohol. And you know it, whether you’ve lived in a place where your next door neighbors were really loud when they came home, whether it was a roommate you’ve had to clean up after, you know what I’m talking about.What we want is to create a culture, a campus community where number one, there are no bystanders that are not engaged and active. Each one of us has a responsibility to be a positive bystander and engage and interrupt behavior that is questionable.RB: And I should say, I think that’s one thing that really has changed in our approach both to sexual assault as well as to alcohol compared to 10 or 15 years ago, the emphasis not just on you yourself have to pay attention to your behavior, but that this is a broader community, and you need to actually help others as part of that, and if you see someone who may be in trouble in some form or another or not be able to care for themselves, there should be some way to intervene. I thought that was one thing where the “Tonight” video did a really nice job of giving people a sense of what would that mean? How do you do that without making a fool of yourself?LB: Or looking like a goody goody or whatever. … That’s what we do as Badgers. That’s what we stand for is that we take care of each other, we don’t let anybody else fall victim to anything and that we are willing to take a stand. If we do that, I really think we can move the needle on this. That’s what the “It’s On Us” campaign is about, is that it it is about us as a community coming together, but i think it holds true for alcohol as well.BH: As a follow up to that question is the responsible action bill. It failed to pass in April and the university was pretty outspoken about saying its unnecessary on this campus and it’s already in its own bylaws. What do you think would be an appropriate level of state involvement in this matter, if any?Responsible Action bill may grant underage drinkers amnesty
During medical emergencies caused by the overconsumption of alcohol, underage drinkers could be given some amnesty from police punishment if Read…LB: Do you want me to answer? Because if I respond you might not like it.RB: Go ahead. I can always disagree.LB: Well I would just like to point out, and you can do your research as good researchers should, look at the last time the alcohol tax was increased in this state. Because we could solve your issues for tuition, my issues with regard to alcohol education if we increased —what we have here is a beer barrel tax where most states have a beer can or bottle tax — the beer barrel tax by one penny.RB: And I should note when we talk about evidence, this is one where there is actually substantial amount of evidence in the extent to which underage drinking and abusive drinking actually is correlated with the price of alcohol.LB: It’s the truth. I don’t think anybody would notice if on a six pack it went up six cents. I’m pretty much guaranteeing no one would know that, if we moved from a barrel tax to a bottle or can tax, and if we increased it by one cent.BH: So if no one would notice, then, would it make a difference?LB: It would make a difference to funding level.BH: Have you talked to state lawmakers about this and are you considering any sort of action on that end?RB: We haven’t been actively pushing this at this point with state lawmakers. I mean, I think it hasn’t been a conversation that has been too likely in the state of Wisconsin.BH: How effective is the responsible action policy at UW?LB: We have a responsible action guidelines … Those are currently in place and have been in place for three [or more] years. I would actually go to the “It’s On Us” campaign and say that I would really hope you wouldn’t need a guideline to demonstrate your care for your friend. It actually makes me a little bit saddened to think, “Oh we have to have a guideline that says we’ll absolve you of your responsibility of drinking so that you would take care of your friend.” It makes me actually, like I said, a little bit sad. But we have it in place. I will tell you, I’m not sure I can tell you one instance where it’s been used.RB: I would say the responsible action legislation last year, as you know, almost uniformly, police opposed that, because they thought that it went too far in one direction in terms of getting people byes … if they reported something on someone else. There were situations where police did want the opportunity, so that was a big issue on that. It was an issue for our police here, as well. It’s not that there is no legislation of that sort that wouldn’t be useful. I think a lot of folks felt that particular legislation wasn’t as well written as it should be.LB: And I do think it applied only to students, so then somebody who was like 19 and wasn’t a student, they would be held to a different standard, so i think it really was … it was weak legislation.BH: We see all sorts of rankings about, you know, academics and stuff like that, but we also see a bunch of party rankings. How do you guys feel about Madison, in a way, having this reputation of a party school?RB: So i like the fact that our alums think back to their time in Madison as, among other things, they talk about what they learned here, they talk about the friends they made, but they also had a good time here. That is important for where you’re going to come to college. I am not happy about our rankings on some of these that really emphasize particularly stuff that involves extensive drinking. I mean, the Playboy ranking really is not a ranking I want to be high on. I think there’s ways that this can be a fun place. Who said that they came here because they liked sailing? There’s a lot of good things that go on around here. We don’t have to drink to excess in order to have a good time. If you do, there’s a problem.To no Badger’s surprise, Mifflin, Freakfest reign on list of top college traditions
Long after you’ve nabbed a diploma and settled into 9-to-5 existence, you’ll run into proud Badger alumni at bars and Read…LB: It was interesting. I was meeting with the young alum earlier this fall who said when the Playboy ranking specifically came out, that they were razzed at their place of employment. I just worry that it devalues the UW-Madison degree, and is that what we want? The whole idea is that in his place of work and his office, it was like, “You’re not that smart. You come from a Playboy list school.”I would hope that’s not what we end up being known for, but instead we’re known for students who will stand up for each other, this pride that runs so deep throughout this campus, the energy on a football Saturday, the excitement that our students demonstrate when they go out and volunteer in the community. Those are things that I would love us to be known for, the concept of being a part of cutting edge research, learning things that aren’t yet in books. Those are the things that, I think, I want our students to shout from the mountain tops and not allow some ranking to interfere.RB: Those are the things that I hear from alums when they look back is to what did they learn and where did they actually get something from this place. It’s those sort of experiences that you always hear about.BH: In terms of the value of the degree you’ve been very outspoken about making UW-Madison the competitive and premier institution that it is. Now, a year in, how is your perspective on how to address that changed, or has it?RB: Well, I don’t know if it has. I would hope I have a more specific implementation plan around certain things. As you may know, one of the things we’ve started this year is we’ve really tried to step up our communication with the state about what the value of this institution is to the state, both in terms of a source of skilled labor, but even more so because I think this is what people don’t understand: Of course they know we graduate well-skilled people but what the value of having a first rate research institution is to the state and its economy and the companies that exist here, and communicating that to the state I think is important.I think being more visible in the national conversation and more present in the national higher education conversation is important. One, we did some restructuring, for instance, in our office of research with the grad school so we had more resources available for someone to really be a leader in terms of the research conversations that reflects the school, that gets enormous amounts of research dollars.So, you know, there’s the external marketing piece that I don’t think Wisconsin has done as well as some other schools do. As I’ve said, I’m from the upper Midwest. I know the culture of “we don’t talk about ourselves very much here.” We need to talk about ourselves more because we’ve got some really great things here, and I’m trying to put in place some ways in which word about all the good things about the University of Wisconsin will get out a little bit more visibly and publicly than it has. The other piece of it is all the other things we’re doing on campus and making sure that we stay on the cutting edge of research and that we have great educational programs.DC: We are in the middle of a gubernatorial election. Do you have a stance either way on what each candidate would do for the university?RB: I’m going to be very happy to work with whoever the governor of the state of Wisconsin is. Whoever that is, I’m hoping it’s someone who would — and I think this is true of both candidates — who understand the value of education and of the higher education system in the state of Wisconsin.Walker and Burke face off in higher education debate
With the most recent Marquette Law School poll showing the gubernatorial race in a dead heat, the two candidates’ views Read…DC: Do you think there would be differences in implementations of policies?RB: You know, I don’t think that I’m the appropriate person to comment on that. You can look at the two campaigns and see what they say about higher education. But I will work happily with anyone who is elected.DC: Last year when you met with student media, you talked about how you wanted to become more involved with people on the other end of State Street. So far, have you seen a shift in UW-state relations?RB: So, a number of things have happened. I will say that I spend a lot of time on the other end of State Street or meeting them even out in their districts because I traveled around the state quite a bit this last year, as well, and in many cases I met with legislators locally or in their office or I’ve had legislators over breakfast at Olin House at my residence a number of days. I don’t know what the numbers are. I think I’ve met with some 115 or 120 state legislators over the years. I’ve really wanted to work at this because anyone who’s in a more political environment knows that personal relationships really matter in that environment.I will also note that the new president of the [UW System] Ray Cross, who started last February, has really made an effort as well to reach out, and I think that’s helpful as well for all of us within the higher education system. So, two things happened this spring that I think were a sign of improved relations. One, the fund balances issue, which blew everything up a year-and-a-half ago, the [Legislature’s] finance committee set a very specific set of rules and regulations about how we report these balances, what they need to know, what we need to do. I mean in some sense, I hope it’s put the issue behind us. It’s clear agreement on everyone’s part about, with the Legislative Audit Bureau’s guidance, what is it that we need to be showing everyone and what does that mean. That, I thought, was a good sign.The other thing that happened this spring is again a year-and-a-half ago we were set to implement, to put our own HR system in place, so we were no longer in the state human resources system. The problem here is the state system is not necessarily very well designed for the job titles and the roles that you have on a big research campus. So we were going to get that discretion. That got pulled away in the upset over reserves, and it was supposed to be implemented [more than] a year ago in July. They told us in June [it wasn’t] going to happen. The appropriate committee came back and has now given us the ability to move forward with that at beginning of the next budget cycle. I worked hard on that one to try to persuade people that this was important to the university, would let us run more effectively, and that they should trust us on this one. so the fact that they gave us that approval, I also considered to be a good sign. There’s a lot of discussions we’re going to have this coming year on budgets and where that’s going to go, but I think we are on a pretty good track.BH: What about on the federal level? The Cap Times just did a thing on Ben Miller in DC. There’s sequestration cuts, [National Institutes of Health] funding, the Higher Education Act. What kind of priorities are you setting at the federal level?RB: Ben was just hired this past year, so we really started last fall, this federal office. We had had a federal relations person. They were here in Madison. And I thought it was really important to have people on the ground in Washington DC in part because I want Wisconsin to be part of both the conversation that happens in the House and Senate around policy issues, as well as the conversation that’s going on inside agencies since a third — more than a third of our budget comes from federal funding, and we really have to care what the agency priorities are and where they’re going.Our biggest concern by far is federal research dollars. At what level are those approved, and what are the specific policies involving how they’re paid out, and so we’ve been very heavily involved in the budget debates. The budget bill did not get signed, no surprise, hasn’t happened for quite a few years so we’re under a continuing resolution. But we’ve actually ended up, I think, and it’s not just Wisconsin but working with a coalition of other universities, as well, with some reasonably good proposals for research funding should Congress come back after the election and actually pass the appropriations bills. They’re at pretty good levels. If they stay with the CR, the continuing resolution the whole year, we won’t get any increases. We will get what we got last year.The research dollars have been up and down in recent years, and that’s really hard for our researchers who have labs they’ve got people they hired, undergraduates, graduate students, post docs, to not have a steady stream of funding, to be uncertain whether you’re going to get renewed or whether you’re going to have to wait six months until when your money runs out or the renewal comes through. That’s a problem, so we’re really trying to communicate that, particularly to our DC delegation from Wisconsin and why they need to support this.BH: Do you think they understand that? I mean, we’ve got Paul Ryan, a pretty important person on budgeting issues. Do you think the delegation understands the message that you guys have been putting out?RB: We’ve actually had some pretty strong support in our delegation. Mark Pocan here locally has been a very strong supporter of this. Tammy Baldwin, our senator, has actually done a number of things, very, very helpful to try to stabilize and have a good level of federal funding. There are people elsewhere around the state, as well, who’ve been actively involved in this debate. It’s a pretty good delegation on this issue.But if we don’t talk to them about the concerns and give them the anecdotes and tell them sort of what’s happening in the higher education system in Wisconsin and why it matters to their state, it’s not that they would be opposed but they become more proactive when they understand what the benefits are to the state of Wisconsin. And for that, we need to be there talking to them.Pocan: Walker’s tuition freeze ‘lipstick on the pig’

The university’s been handing out IDs. Do you think that’s all going well and do you have any concerns about whether there’ll be any confusion among students with the additional document that they have to bring to the polls? Do you have any concerns on that?LB: Well I hope not.

That’s up on MyUW, and so you can access that really quickly as well.BH: Maybe I’ve missed this but what kind of outreach efforts is UW-Madison doing?LB: You mean you didn’t read my email? Are you confessing here?BH: I’ve seen a couple of things, but is there like a video or a marketing campaign going on?LB: There is a video. There is a marketing campaign. Both have been tweeted out. Come on, you follow me!RB: There are student groups on campus that are really working with us and helping on this, as well.LB: But [we do have a website with more information] vote.wisc.edu.RB: I will say, this is one where, everybody picks up one of your two publications, over a week and reads it or looks at it at least, so anything you can do to help get the word out on this is really useful.BH: I wanted to talk a little bit about the growing class sizes, admission class sizes. How is the university dealing with bringing in more students? We talked with, I think it was Mark Pocan [or Scott Resnick] who said that dorm prices were rising.RB: We actually are down a little this year over last year … We’ve had three higher number years and plan to stay at about this level. This year, it’s down by somewhere between 200 and 300 students compared to last year. That’s sort of noise given the total numbers.As you know, we’ve built some new dorms. I think we probably [have] the right capacity dorms for this size. The other thing we’ve been doing over the last four or five years is we’ve been increasing the number of teachers in those big intro classes to reduce bottlenecks. And actually, we have made those classes more accessible because of that. We’ve been working to improve advising, and we’ve actually brought down time to graduation. So I think that there’s not a concern about size right now from what I know is going on in the numbers.I don’t know what he was talking about in terms of dorm prices, and he might have been talking about broader numbers than just Madison. Our prices do tick up a little every year and they certainly did this year. I believe this is true that we have if it’s not the lowest, it’s one of the very lowest room and board prices in the Big Ten. And we are hardly the cheapest community in the Big Ten to live in. So we’ve actually been, I think, incredibly responsible in managing prices for students who live on campus.BH: And on the topic of incoming classes, I noticed your last blog post about diversity. Can you expand a little bit about that?RB: You want to talk about diversity in the incoming class or diversity more broadly on campus?BH: Both. You can talk about both.RB: This was actually one of our most diverse classes. … I think we’re at around 10 percent of historically disadvantaged minorities in this class, which is a very strong number for us, particularly in the state of Wisconsin, where we’re a little minority challenged around here. It’s also more diverse class in terms of international backgrounds. We have people from more countries than we’ve seen otherwise. So the freshman class looks pretty good on this dimension.One thing that I’ve been going around talking about diversity in a number of different places and I just want to say diversity is not about we want to feel good or we want to do something here that people tell us we should be doing. Diversity is fundamentally about the mission of education.If you ask what people get when they go away to college, there’s a whole bunch of answers to that. But one of the answers is they go into an environment where they meet a whole bunch of people who aren’t like them and aren’t like their families, who come from different backgrounds, different experiences, different parts of the country, different parts of the world, think differently about gender identity or about religion or politics. That interaction with a whole bunch of different people, whether it’s your classmate or a staff member or your professors, is a really key part of the educational process because I can promise you, any of you wherever you go work are going to be in very diverse environments over the next 40 years in this global economy.And making sure that we have students who have had those diverse experiences and know how to work with and get along with and even live with at times depending on who your roommates are, people from very different backgrounds is a really important part of what the experience here at Wisconsin should be about. So I take diversity as a core educational mission.There was a committee this last year of students, staff, faculty and community members who reviewed the diversity on campus, wrote a diversity framework document that was released in May. That document had a whole bunch of recommendations at a pretty high level. It was sort of goals for the university that we should be looking at. It wasn’t an implementation plan [where] you should go do one, two and three.What we’re doing this fall and this information, I think, is just getting posted is we are building the implementation plan. There’s a lot of recommendations in this report. We’re trying to prioritize the recommendations, say, “What things can we just do? What things do we need to think about further and how do we think about them?” And we’re appointing six task forces of depending on what the area is, students, staff faculty, to look at areas such as faculty staff hiring, culture issues, areas where we want them to take some of the recommendations in the report and say, “OK this is what the university is doing. Here’s where there are some gaps. Here’s where they can improve. Here are some explicit recommendations around how you move forward on these recommendations in the next year or two.”LB: There’s a student town hall meeting specifically designed to hear from you all, so it’d be great if you would be there. There were 30 recommendations, I might add. So it’s not like a small number. It’s 30.RB: And you’ve got to do some prioritizing on this. You can’t do 30 things at once, and that’s OK. There’s many of these recommendations that overlap. So you can work on several of them at the same time.DC: Do you have any sort of timeline?RB: For these six groups, they’ve been told to report out by the end of this semester at the latest, so that we actually can start implementing things. There are a few [of] what I think are more “do it” type of recommendations that we are trying to just put in place. … For instance, there’s some recommendations here around establishing a better curriculum of [ethnic studies], and we should review that curriculum. … That’s one of the recommendations. Do we have the most effective set of courses there? And another related recommendation is to try to build a certificate in ethnic studies. So you need to get [related groups] on campus that work on this, the faculty, staff, student committees together to look at those recommendations and think about: Does it make sense to do these, and how would you do them if you wanted to, and what are their recommendations.LB: And that’s not a short term.RB: That’s probably one of the longest term things because it takes a while to change curriculum and get teachers and classes in place. But I’d like to be in a place early next year where we know what are the things we’re going to really push to try to accomplish over the next year or two and be able to lay those out, and talk very specifically about this is what we’re doing and the timeline on which we’re doing them.DC: In terms of those “do it” kind of items, do you have examples of some of those?LB: Implementing more award for our staff of color and for their marginalized populations, for our faculty, staff and students. How are we making sure that we’re recognizing the achievements that are on our campus and kind of heralding them? That’s one example. I think that there’s also looking at the staffing structures that are currently in place. … There’s some of those things that will be done internally that, as the chancellor said, just do it or check them off. I think we have that in place to make those happen.DC: And are those more staff centered or more student centered?RB: There’s a whole set of issues, and I think these six task forces we’re creating, some will be more focused on student related issues such as the curricular one. Some are much more focused on staff or faculty hiring or training. There’s the whole culture issue which I think stretches across all of these and is very, very central to how do you create a culture across campus that is open and welcoming to incredibly diverse populations.LB: The report is online, so you can review it yourself and kind of make your own sense of it. But I think some of them are pretty obvious that you’d be like, “Oh that’s probably one that the chancellor was talking about [and] we need to get that one done.” Some of them, and we’ve used the ethnic studies as an example, I think the recruitment of more staff and faculty, specifically again not a short-term one but a long-term one.RB: And I should say we’ve had some real successes on the recruitment among historically disadvantaged groups for faculty in particular. I know that this year we had a very strong presence in our new faculty of people of African-American and Latino background. … There’s a lot of stuff going on on campus already. I think three or four years ago, they established a fund to provide incentives to departments that could identify really first-rate potential faculty who are of a historically disadvantaged background and to help cost share with departments to bring people in. If a department is a target of opportunity but didn’t have a funding line we wanted to try to encourage them to think about that anyway if there really is an opportunity to bring someone here. We’ve been pretty successful at that and one of the things I did was that money ran out after three years and I renewed that money for another three years. That was one of the sort of “just do it” type things to make sure it keeps going.DC: There was talk last year about merging four of the ethnic studies certificates and making it into one bigger department. I think a lot of it was for financial reasons. Is that a continuing conversation going forward?RB: I think you’re going to have to ask the L&S dean about that because this is one that really was inside the liberal arts college, and the dean was the one who was running that issue and not me.BH: Going back to relations between the university and the state, Tommy Thompson a couple of days ago said that UW leadership could be doing a bit more to reach out to state lawmakers. I know you’ve said you’ve talked to more than half of them.RB: I’m not sure what more I could’ve done this past year.BH: Is there anything more that we can be doing and are they getting that message? We’ve got a budget session coming up next year. Do you think they’re understanding?RB: There’s going to be a lot of competition for state dollars. There’s always more increases needed in the Medicaid program … that’s largely state funded, the transportation trust fund is in trouble, that’s going to need dollars, K-12 is going to come in with big dollar requests. Legislators have a lot of stuff on their plate and you have to tell them why the higher education system is worthy of their attention given everything else that is there.The UW System has come in with a $94 million budget request. That’s a strong request. The governor asked all agencies to come in with flat dollars and the system decided and we all decided together that we were going to do that, but it’s a tough budget environment. The revenues have been coming in at a disappointing level, and it’s just not clear how this budget debate will play out.I know that I’m committed, and I know the president of the system is committed to doing everything we can to communicate about the importance of this budget funding to our universities. One of the major concerns I have is we were given a pretty substantial budget cut last time around as a result of that reserves debate and we did not take the budget cut. We filled the hole with our reserves.If there is no new budget funding this year, we will have to take the cut effective next year and that will mean a 4 percent cut, if I did this across the board, to all of our educational programs. That’s a big cut for a university like this and it’s one reason why I’m hopeful there will be some new funding in the state budget because I would like to be cutting less than 4 percent if at all possible.BH: Last year, the Joint Finance Committee co-chairs called for former UW System President Kevin Reilly to be fired. Do you think that relations have changed fundamentally since then [and] maybe we can get more funding for the university system?RB: A lot of that happened before I came, I think that Ray Cross, the new president, has been doing a great job in terms of relations at the other end of State Street … and he’s very good at that. So I think we have better communication, but better communication alone is not going to get you a state budget, if our revenues are down and everyone else needs money at the same time.So there is going to be the standard budget fight over how you allocate scarce dollars across a whole number of places — all of which are deserving and were obviously going to come in make the case. I hope that we can get some of our alumni involved. I hope that the Associated Students of Madison Legislative Affairs Committee can get involved in this. I am hoping that there may be a few leaders in the business community who will make the case to the state Legislature about the importance of Madison and the rest of the higher education system to the state and the need to really fund it at good level.BH: I know you’ve talked about this in the past, but the governor called for an extension of the tuition freeze. What are your thoughts on that?RB: So we are very sympathetic to the need to make the University of Wisconsin affordable to people from the state of Wisconsin. I really understand that. I’m an economist [so] I would argue a tuition freeze ought to mean an increase at the rate of inflation, that’s just me, and I don’t think we’re going to get that. So I don’t have a problem with freezing undergraduate in-state tuition, [but] you can’t do that forever. Prices do go up at some point [and] you’re going to have to raise tuition to reflect that.I would say two things about this freeze, one is that there are prices out there that I shouldn’t be subsidizing in particular for out-of-state students fornd I think we’re not at market price right now. We’re well below a lot of some of our competitors. I have students who turn us down for admission and go to universities where they pay a whole lot mo some of my professional schools. They are much more places that should be market price, are in tuition. So I would like to look at some tuition levels, not the in-state undergraduate, and have some options to try to make some changes there.The other thing I would say is that I really want a deeper pool of financial aid dollars. We have fewer financial aid dollars in this state in higher education than most of our competitor states. I could make that case to the state government, but this is also one, as I’m going into a fundraising campaign with our alums, that I plan to make strong simply because I think our alums are people who would understand the need for financial aid, and I think might be very willing to give us some additional dollars to deepen that pool. I’m working on a number of fronts on keeping the university affordable while still being able to finance all the things that go on around here.DC: When you say market price, can you kind of give me an idea about where we are now and what market price would be?RB: I can tell you right now the top of the Big Ten is the University of Michigan which I think is [more than] $40,000 a year, this is tuition not room and board. We’re 26. So we are $14,000 below University of Michigan. Now I don’t want to be at the top of the list here but we are $2,000, I think more than $2,000, below the average Big Ten school. We are not at the bottom end of quality in the Big Ten. We compete with Michigan, we compete with a number of good privates and I think validly though our out-of-state students, we can be charging them more.Now I can go talk to the regents and we can discuss what’s reasonable here, and I think with anything you do you want to phase in over time. You’re not going to want to jump out-of-state tuition by huge amounts in any one year, but I do think we are pricing ourselves much below where we should be. Similarly, I can give you some examples with other professional schools. Our vet medical school, I find this particularly amazing, our out-of-state tuition for our vet medical school is below in-state tuition at the University of Illinois. So we have students from Illinois who come here because it’s cheaper than going in-state for them. I don’t understand that at all, that makes no sense to me.These schools should be priced at market which is where their peers are and that would really help on a lot of financial fronts and allow me to maintain lower prices for in-state and undergraduates because then I’m not subsidizing all these other students who are in slightly different markets.DC: Is there a midlevel in the Big Ten you’d like to get down to for out of state?RB: I don’t know that I’m ready to put a specific number on it. I don’t want to be at $40,000 but increasingly, there are a number of schools that are around the $34,000-$36,000 range. I think that’s really — with a number of step functions — where we should be aiming. By the time we get there, it’ll have gone up another $10,000, and you have to put some of that additional money, plow it back into financial aid. Because you [cannot have] students who need aid, who are coming from outside the state, who you want to admit, but may not be able to afford this. So anytime you raise tuition, some amount of that goes back into deepening the financial aid pool.BH: Going off that, how can UW, while keeping the cost, still seek out international and out-of-state students and be accessible?RB: There are good number of out-of-state and international students who can afford higher tuition because I know where they go when they turn us down, so I don’t think we’d be seriously threatening our admissions pools by raising out-of-state tuition. That said, I want to repeat again, I do need to be able to attract low-income student both internationally and out-of-state to the University of Wisconsin. We want that. We want that for diversity purposes. We want that because I don’t want to be a university that only attracts the rich kids. It sets the wrong environment here. So that’s … the issue is not what’s your market price, but the issue is [a combination of] what’s your market price and how much are you able to subsidize that for certain groups of students. So if I could raise prices and raise financial aid, to me that’s the ideal world because then the people who can afford higher prices pay it and those who can’t, get the additional financial aid.BH: I want to ask about a headline from Vox.com. It said Harvard University is better at admitting low-income students than public universities raising tuition prices. What are your thoughts on that and how that affects low-income students?RB: I found that an odd article and probably not worth arguing about. Even though the title is about admissions, the article wasn’t about admissions. It was about students who came so “matriculants” as opposed to … so it wasn’t about who you were admitting. It was about who actually came. And it picked out a relatively few number of very wealthy schools which, who basically don’t have to charge tuition at all from what I can see, and said that they were really able to subsidize a substantial share of low-income students. You know, I wish I could do that.I don’t think our admissions numbers look as different. Even though the article is about admissions, it is true that there’s a number of students who I don’t have enough financial aid to bring here and who would need more financial aid if they were going to come here. Some of them don’t go to college at all, some of them go to other state schools in the state of Wisconsin, some of them will be able to get offers from some private schools with substantial financial aid. It’s a pretty small number of students who get to those private schools because there aren’t very many of them who can afford those sorts of subsidies.In that sense it was an odd article because it sort of implied there was hundreds of thousands of students going there and none of them were coming to the publics. If you look at the absolute numbers there’s a lot more low-income people here than there are in the privates but that’s just because we’re so much bigger. Most people who come to college are going to end up in the one of the publics, and our ability to fill the need gap for low-income students is important. We do it for a good number of students. I just can’t do it for everyone in the way that Harvard or Princeton can.BH: That article linked to a report that pointed to Oregon basically wanting to attract these elite students and they talked about how that’s impacted low-income students. Are you concerned that we are attracting these elite students and we won’t get the financial aid for them or are you concerned about what they called “an arms race” between public universities?RB: I’m not sure what you’re saying. There are a number of publics that are increasingly admitting more and more higher-income students and fewer low income students because as their state dollars shrink, they don’t have financial aid and they need those tuition dollars. Wisconsin has by and large tried not to do that, and I think it’s very important that we stay [that way] certainly for within the state. My goal inside the state and — we are nowhere near where we should be on this — is that any student who is admitted here should come — if they’re going to come or not come, let it not be about the cost.I would like to be able to fund full need for any student in-state who has the quality to be admitted at the University of Wisconsin. There may be other reasons why they don’t come but it shouldn’t be because the price. I cannot do that right now. Some of that is because state provides fewer financial aid dollars in this state than elsewhere. Some of it is because I need to work harder on raising some private gifts and other scholarships, but to me, that is really important in-state. Out-of-state, I also want those sorts of funding. That’s not quite as high a priority there but it’s not an unimportant priority. I’ve got to have some scholarships for out-of-state students who could not afford otherwise to come here because I want that mix of students whether it’s overseas and what they bring or whether it’s elsewhere in the United States.DC: So you were talking about how pricing and market value. How else would you determine market value besides just pricing and how do we strike a balance between universities who need money and ways to potentially make business but also an educational institution?RB: So the problem is top educational institutions provide a lot of resources. Putting together volunteer experiences through places like the Morgridge Center for Public Service. There’s always a trade-off here. What set of problems can you provide and at what cost? We’re a pretty lean university if you look at our administrative costs and what number of staff we have doing things. I’m proud of that because I think as a public university that is our responsibility. But you’re always on the balance of where can you save costs and where do you really need to provide programs. Look at the new dorms we built. Those rooms aren’t big. They aren’t much bigger than the old dorms. We didn’t build high-end … the closets are bigger. That’s the main difference; kids come with more stuff.So we do try to make choices that are fiscally responsible, but rising inequality says that high school people’s salaries are going up faster than the average salary in this country. The university is filled with high skill people. If you want to hire top scientists, you pay a lot more for them now than you did 20 years ago, and it’s gone up at a rate much higher than inflation. If I’m going to be a competitor as a first rate university I have to be making the same offers that they’re making in Shanghai and in Germany and in Cambridge, Massachusetts to attract those scientists here. So that is driving my costs up, and I have to find a way to fund that or I give up on being a first-rate research institution. So this has to be at both ends. I’ve got to find ways to keep this university affordable, particularly to Wisconsin residents. At the same time, I want to keep this university at a level of excellence and reputation that it has held for 165 years. That’s a tough job. And we have been talking about various ways to do that.BH: I wanted to ask, you’ve seen these Race to Equity reports. What’s the university’s role in or how much can it do in addressing these disparities in the city of Madison and Wisconsin?RB: First of all, I think big public universities have been at the center of trying to provide opportunity to people from middle-income and lower-income families for centuries. You’ve seen where our students come from here and what their families’ incomes are and the opportunities that you get after you receive a degree here are very large. And so we are doing a lot just by what we’ve always been doing to try to open up opportunities for people who might not otherwise have them and who will never be able to pay for private school tuition.So that’s comment number one, but if you’re talking about the city of Madison, let me say a couple of things — and I take this very seriously. We have an enormous presence in this city. There is always more that we can be doing and the question is how do we prioritize that. So Badger Volunteers we have 1,300 students out there, the majority from which are actually tutoring at the schools and that’s one way to address this issue. That’s not an answer by itself but certainly those volunteers are helpful on the problem.One of the things that I did this past winter because I took this Race to Equity debate so seriously, is [allocate] about $1,500,000 of my discretionary funds — and I don’t have much in the way of discretionary funds — and I turned that into a three-year project for the School of Education to partner with the Madison Public School District to try to say, “What can we do together to try and address the Race to Equity concerns?” The Madison Public School District actually raised money through CUNA, the Credit Union of North America, so they brought matching funds to the table and the [School of] Education and MPSD have put together a program around, particularly, training for new teachers to give them more culture competencies, to work with a more heterogeneous group of students in the classroom, to give them mentoring so they can deal with issues they may not have faced while student teaching, learning about being a teacher. We have a lot of teacher drop-outs, and they often occur in the schools with the most problems. So this program which I think is called Forward Madison is a very direct response to this whole Race to Equity. Is it a complete answer itself? Of course not. The university has to keep engaging in this conversation, but I take this responsibility, particularly in this community because this is where we all live, to be very important.",Transcript: Interview with UW’s Rebecca Blank and Lori Berquam,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2017/04/11/humorology-reminds-uw-of-philanthropic-roots-of-greek-life/,"Apr 11, 2017","Humorology, or “Humo” for short, is a time-honored tradition throughout the Greek community here at the University of Wisconsin. Acapella, pirouettes and more glitter than you’ve ever seen are just a few of the trademarks of a truly fantastic Humo show.If you have friends in Greek life, even if it’s literally just a single person, you’ve probably heard more than your fair share of the time and effort that goes into a single show. But for those of you who have no idea what I’m going on about, I’ll break it down for you.Humorology is an annual musical and variety showcase that around 600 members of sororities and fraternities, as well as those not involved in Greek life, participate in to raise money for a specific charity and get to know other people in Greek life here at UW. This year, the proceeds of the fundraising went to Dane County’s Rainbow Project, which provides mental health services to young children who have experienced trauma.Teams, or casts, are created each year by pairing a sorority with a fraternity. These teams are then given the overarching theme of the end-of-the-year showcase which they must create their show around. This year’s theme was “When Life Gives You Lemons.” The casts are able to include anyone outside of Greek life that wants to join in the fun and they are given the duration of the fall semester to write, compose, choreograph and direct a show they will then use to compete for the seven spots in the final showcase in April.Langdon Street defies every stereotype you have about Greek life
When I tell someone that I’m in a sorority — or simply dare to wear my Greek letters around campus Read…Most casts will practice a minimum of three times a week for a couple hours each meeting during the fall semester to perfect their routines, formations, lines and singing. But after months of hard work and “Humo Hell Week,” the affectionate term for the week of grueling practices at Kanopy dance studio that run into the wee hours of the morning, only seven of the teams make it to the second semester of practices and the final show.Once the spring semester begins, the real fun commences. From reworking the original script and finishing the nearly 20-minute-long production, these casts have their hands full. The directors of each cast will push their members to their breaking points as they cheer them on.From bigger, brighter “Humo faces,” i.e. the ridiculous and exaggerated expressions that are compulsory to any Humo production, to the near screaming of the overly cheerful songs, the directors will urge their cast for their all until it feels like they have nothing left to give. But once the final show comes in April, all of the screaming, laughing and crying pays off as the cast members don their overly-bedazzled costumes and their colorful makeup, boys included.While the corny jokes and glitter are fun, the true reason behind the showcase is the philanthropy. Greek life, in general, holds this charity and goodwill in especially high esteem as almost all of the chapters are founded on some charitable cause.The cast that wins the final showcase is the one that raises the most money, encouraging some friendly competition. In the end, however, all of the money raised between the casts, ticket sales and online donations goes to the charity of the year. This year alone, the final sum donated to the Rainbow Project was around $180,000.‘Finally taking action’: Greek community to implement first major plan to address sexual assault
While Greek life communities across the nation have long been criticized for higher rates of sexual assault, few comprehensive studies Read…Although getting to know your cast mates and bonding throughout the year are memorable, and at times entertaining, Humorology at its core is an amazing program that Greek life puts on every year and that tremendously helps the community.Even if you’re not involved in Greek life, you may want to consider joining a cast or simply donating to the cause and coming to see the final showcase, because I guarantee you won’t regret spending a couple hours supporting the community and laughing your tail off at, and with, the casts.Jenna Webster (jwebster4@wisc.edu) is a sophomore majoring in political science and journalism.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/04/25/uw-alumna-recognized-for-work-with-domestic-violence-issues/,"Apr 25, 2016","As the Justice Systems Director at End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin, Tess Meuer wears many hats.She provides training for domestic violence program advocates, works with agencies and individuals in the legal system and helps domestic violence programs with legal questions they have about their clients.Earlier this month, Meuer was awarded the Warren H. Stolper Adjunct of the Year Award by the University of Wisconsin Law School Alumni Association and Board of Visitors for her wide array of legal work pertaining to domestic violence.The Adjunct of the Year Award recognized the work that Meuer has done in the classroom, teaching students about domestic violence, as well as being a practicing attorney.  According to the law school website, the Adjunct of the Year Award “makes a significant statement about the value and importance that the University of Wisconsin Law School and the Wisconsin Law Alumni Association place on classroom teaching.”In a statement, Patti Seger, End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin executive director, said, “[Meuer] was the first staff attorney hired by End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin. Since that time, she has had an immeasurable impact on the legal community in Wisconsin and in the lives of domestic violence survivors in the state.Meuer said she began her career originally as a high school teacher, but decided to go into law to bolster the status of women in society. Her first year of law school was the first time she attended a class that had about the same number of men and women, she said.She started her career assisting victims of domestic violence when a classmate told her about an opening at the Dane Country Advocates for Battered Women, now called Domestic Abuse Intervention Services.“I was immediately drawn to the social justice nature of doing domestic violence work and helping people better understand the law,” Meuer said.Ending violence, spreading awareness: Madison organizations work against sexual assault and domestic abuse

This course is a small seminar class that focuses on issues that victims of domestic violence experience in the legal system.Meuer said the course makes students more aware of difficulties for victims of domestic violence. These students go on to be family law lawyers, prosecutors, court commissioners and judges, she said. This course also enables students to teach their peers about domestic violence issues, she added.Meuer also established an internship program at End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin, where she is the justice systems director. This internship program engages students in legal issues that victims face like restraining orders, family law proceedings and helping individuals and programs navigate the legal system, Meuer said.Meuer said the hardest part of her work is not having enough resources to help victims that are in need of legal assistance. She said that the family law system refuses to acknowledge the injustice that is experienced by victims that have to face their abuser without representation.To help these victims, Meuer said she works with advocates all over Wisconsin who are caring, compassionate and dedicated to helping victims and survivors of domestic abuse.“I am honored to offer legal information and resources which might allow advocates to better serve female and male victims and their children to better navigate the complexities of the legal system,” Meuer said.",UW alumna recognized for work with domestic violence issues,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2015/11/11/similarities-between-rodent-human-minds-used-in-ptsd-research/,"Nov 11, 2015","Studies of rodents at University of Wisconsin use similarities in rat and human minds to find out more about post-traumatic stress disorder.PTSD is a mental condition that some individuals develop after being subjected to life-threatening experiences, including abuse, combat, sexual assault or terrorist attacks, Vaishali Bakshi, an associate professor of psychiatry at UW School of Medicine and Public Health, said.While not everyone who experiences a traumatic experience develops PTSD, for those who do, it can be a chronic illness, Bakshi said.Their research model analyzed rodents and how stress affected the chemicals within their brains in order to further understand how specific chemicals mediate responses to trauma.“Rats’ brains are wired exactly the same as human brains,” Bakshi said. “The rat makes a good model because all the anatomy and chemistry are identical.”But in order for the research to be applicable to PTSD in humans, scientists had to model the stress the rats experienced after the trauma PTSD patients encountered.To do this, Bakshi said, the rats have to psychologically feel their lives are in danger.So the researchers took advantage of the natural relationship between predators and prey. The rats were placed in metal cages, and those cages were placed within a ferret cage — animals that are natural predators to mice.While there was no physical contact between the two animals, through purely psychological manipulation, the rat felt threatened. This practice was repeated three separate times for five minute intervals, Bakshi said. When compared to the control rats, who had been placed in metal cages without any predators nearby, brain cells called neurons located in the amygdala became hypersensitive.This is significant because the amygdala is the region of the brain that is associated with the emotion of fear, Bakshi said.Brian Baldo, an assistant professor of psychiatry and a scientist who worked on the project, studied the anatomy of the brain and the specific cells in the amygdala that produced PTSD symptoms. The chemical norepinephrine and the hormone corticotropin-releasing factor were found to interact, which plays a significant role in PTSD symptoms, Baldo said.“Norepinephrine is very important for regulating arousal and is also recruited in stress. CRF is very important because it is a hormone clearly involved in the brain’s response to stress,” Baldo explained. The rats continued to show oversensitivity one month after they had been presented with the stressor, which is equivalent to several years for humans, Bakshi said.“We are pretty excited because we now have a way of tying all the information together,” Bakshi said. “We can start to test whether or not if we change how much of a chemical is available, we can prevent PTSD from developing.”UW scientists are now hoping to obtain an additional grant that would fund further research that would look into why some people develop PTSD while others do not, Bakshi said.The research would identify new drug targets and study the relationship between the chemicals that cause PTSD and stress-induced relapse in drug abuse, she said.“This was the first step in what can hopefully be a long and fruitful string of studies,” Baldo said.","Similarities between rodent, human minds used in PTSD research",UWM

This may include physical, emotional, verbal or sexual violence.On college campuses alone, domestic violence is cited as common as sexual assault, despite getting much less attention.

In addition, the little media attention that domestic violence does garner is largely unrepresentative of the populations that disproportionately experience domestic violence.Domestic violence in the media largely portrays white, heterosexual couples, wherein a woman is experiencing violence from her male partner. Many view domestic violence victims as solely young, white and middle or upper class cisgender women.

This occurred in the wake of several women accusing Vann of sexual misconduct, which prompted the group to release a statement via Twitter saying they had been lied to and cancelled their tour to “go home and regroup.”Vann’s removal from the group was announced in May 2018. In December 2018, rapper Dom McLennon of Brockhampton tweeted that Vann had also set up his friend to be robbed, something Vann told him after he was removed from the group.Vampire Weekend to release first album in six years, singles show promise
When Vampire Weekend told the crowds at Lollapalooza last summer a new album was nearly complete, people went absolutely bonkers. Read…While Vann was not charged with anything, it is hard to argue  he is in the wrong given his lack of attempts to defend himself, and the accounts of the women who said Vann mistreated them.The issue of Vann’s removal is polarizing, and he has been almost totally inactive on the internet since his removal for over a year. That is, until now.Sept. 18, Vann released his debut solo album “Emmanuel.” The album did not shy away from all of the drama with Brockhampton, and Vann got right into the meat of the situation on the first and title track of the album “Emmanuel.”The following lines on the song directly speak to the situation with Brockhampton.“It’s so hard to say I’m sorry it’s so hard to self reflect/… I’m still runnin’ out of friends steady runnin’ the past/.”Vann also speaks to his relationship with his girlfriend on the song.“Had a girl, she was a goddess, I fucked up and had to lose her/.”The remainder of the title track is both a reflection on the mistakes Vann made, coupled with grim, aggressive lyrics about suicide and depression.Watsky’s ‘Complaint’ Tour leaves fans with no complaints

For fans who simply wanted to hear Vann’s side of the story, “Emmanuel” also does that in a bold way. The project is also riddled with religious metaphors, references to suicide, violence, drugs and alcohol.He has made a project here that is brutally honest in portraying his current state of mind.","After wave of allegations, Ameer Vann finally resurfaces with new music",UWM

Nov. 8 was the day millions of Americans willfully cast aside their decency as human beings to vote for arguably the most controversial, demagogic, egotistical man who has ever attempted to set foot in the White House. Unfortunately, to the utter dismay of the 59,727,805 people who cast their ballots for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, President-elect Donald Trump won.Trump, Johnson sweep Wisconsin in historic night for Republicans
In a historic sweep of battleground states that blindsided pollsters and analysts, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed victory early Wednesday Read…To the white people who voted for Trump, what were you thinking? The man you elected is just as elitist as any other politician already in Washington. He will not rid the government of its corruptness — he is just as corrupt as any politician there today. Trump’s economic plans will not create jobs for you or stimulate the economy. His plans to repeal Obamacare could strip more than 20 million Americans of affordable healthcare, including many poor white Americans. The man you elected is so controversial that many of you feel the need to defend your choice to vote for him, clarifying that you are not a racist, a bigot, sexist or homophobic. Yet on Nov. 8, you cast your ballot for a man who is all of the above.To the women who voted for Trump, what were you thinking? The man you elected has been accused of sexual assault countless times. The man you voted for believes that is it okay for men to grab women, kiss women, rape women without their consent. Trump does not believe the wage gap is an issue and is content with women being paid 80 cents to every dollar he, a man, makes. Trump, as well as Vice President-elect Mike Pence, believes that the landmark Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade should be dealt with by pro-life justices, essentially meaning a woman’s right to an abortion would no longer be federally protected.To the Latinos who voted for Trump, what were you thinking? The man you elected is blatantly racist. Trump has called for the building of a wall separating Latin America, specifically Mexico, from the United States. Why?Trump said,“[Because] we have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get them out.”Trump places all Latinos in two categories: drug lords or illegal immigrants, and refuses to open his eyes to the reality of the millions of successful, kind, educated Latino members of communities around the country. Trump repeatedly called for the revocation of the 14th amendment and birthright citizenship in order to remove illegal immigrants and their children from America.To the African Americans who voted for Trump, what were you thinking? The man you elected believes that all African Americans live in the inner cities. He calls you uneducated, jobless and entangled in crime. Is this the America you want to live in? An America where the president sees only the negatives of an entire race? An America that ignores the millions of African Americans who are educated, middle class citizens that do not reside in a ghetto? America cannot be great again if entire races are subjected to stereotyping by their government.To the Americans in the LGBTQ+ community who voted for Trump, what were you thinking? The man you elected and his vice president are homophobes. Trump wants to undo the monumental Supreme Court decision allowing for gay marriage, as he believes gay people do not deserve to have that right.UW regent defends Trump after lewd remarks
House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, condemned the recent comments of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, but many Wisconsin Republicans have not followed suit. Read…Pence has said gay couples mark a “societal collapse” and opposed a law that would prohibit discrimination against LBGTQ+ people in the workplace. Is this the America you want to live in? An America where you cannot marry who you love? An America whose President and Vice President want to change your sexual orientation? America cannot be great again if people do not have the freedom to love who they love.And finally, to the Americans that voted third party, what were you thinking? The man you elected does not represent your views, otherwise you would have actively voted for him. You didn’t have to love either candidate, and you didn’t have to agree with 100 percent of their platforms. All you had to do was recognize that Clinton was by far the lesser of two evils.Yes, Bernie Sanders may have been more up your ally, but the ‘Never Hillary’ mantra just bought a misogynistic, racist man his one-way ticket to the White House. Is this the America you want to live in? An America with a president who does not even come close to sharing the same values as you? An America whose two party system remains intact despite your feeble attempts to change it? America cannot be great again if its citizens throw temper tantrums when their ideal candidate is not endorsed by a major party, choosing instead to allow for a man like Trump to be elected.For reasons still beyond comprehension, Nov. 8, 2016 was the day Americans decided to elect Trump to the presidency, and I have never been more terrified of what making America great again will mean these next four years.Sincerely,A concerned AmericanAly Niehans (alyniehans@outlook.com) is a freshman majoring in political science and international studies.","November 8, 2016 was a disgrace",UWM

Here are a couple more topics that got left off last week’s article, but are still necessary safety tips to aid in your kinky curiosity.As I teased last week, one of the most titillating features found in the second installment, Fifty Shades Darker, is the use of a butt plug. Initially used as a relaxation device that was marketed as “Dr. Young’s Ideal Rectal Dilators” in the late 19th century, butt plugs are a unique way to expand intense sexual pleasure.Hump Day: Guide to recreating ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ safely
Now that the series has reached its climax, let us (safely) help you reach yours. The “Fifty Shades of Grey” Read…The most important thing to remember when inserting a toy or object up the rectum is that one must use a specifically designed plug for the rectum with a flared end. While the vagina is closed off by the cervix, thereby preventing any objects from traveling further up the body, the rectum leads directly to the colon. This anatomy leaves a distinct possibility of getting objects stuck up there, and no one wants to call 911 and explain that situation, trust me. Luckily, flared bottoms are standard issue with any marketed butt plug, so do not fret.When selecting a beginner’s butt plug, look for a silicone based plug that is of small to medium thickness. While stainless steel plugs may be pretty and adorned with gem details, the weight of these plugs can cause significant strain and lead to injury.Hump Day: Surefire tips to obtain, maintain enthusiastic consent

Do not apply pressure at this point, as this experience can be frightening enough for a beginning submissive partner.

Prolonged and frequent choking sessions can lead to oxygen deprivation and major health consequences, so vary your activities from session to session.Cook plea, sentencing crucial to revolutionizing sexual assault protocol on campus

https://badgerherald.com/news/2009/03/04/victim-comes-forward/,"Mar 4, 2009","“My life is ruined because of this. I don’t trust anyone; I honestly feel as if I can’t be a normal college student anymore. There are days I don’t want to get out of bed. I’ve never had that before in my life.”These are the words of a University of Wisconsin student allegedly drugged and raped last fall at the Sigma Chi fraternity house on Langdon Street.Describing her life as forever changed by the assault, the victim contacted The Badger Herald nearly five months later with the hopes of conveying her experience to the rest of campus.The following is her story:“This cannot be possible”It was Oct. 4, and the UW football team had just lost to the Ohio State Buckeyes in one of the two night games played in the 2008 season. The victim was walking home from the game when she, a pledge from her sorority and two members of Sigma Chi decided to go to State Street Brats.After a few drinks, the four decided to move on to a crowded Johnny O’s Restaurant and Bar.On the rooftop deck of Johnny O’s, the victim bought her friends pineapple vodkas and handed them back from the bar until she received her own.“The last thing I remember was saying to [my friend], ‘Wow, this pineapple vodka is really good.’ I don’t remember one thing after that,” the victim said.Around 2:30 a.m., the victim awoke in a room on the first floor of the Sigma Chi house with no recollection of how she had arrived there.“I wake up, and this person comes into his room and says, ‘What the fuck, why are you passed out in my room? Why are your pants off? This is not OK — you cannot pass out in someone’s room. What the fuck are you doing here?’ And just yelling at me. And I said, ‘Sorry, I don’t know why I’m here,'” the victim said.After texting someone that she felt embarrassed about the encounter, the victim found her way home and fell back to sleep.When she woke up the next morning, she went to the bathroom and found she was sore and bleeding profusely. Crying, she called her mother and said she believed she was raped.“At first it was like, ‘No this cannot be possible — this cannot happen,'” the victim said. “I put two and two together, and I just started bawling. A whole part of my soul was just immediately taken. No words people say were what [could] have comforted me on that day. I cried, and then it was over and then I was numb.”By 11 a.m., she arrived with her roommate at Meriter Hospital. Health officials collected DNA, took pictures and performed other procedures necessary to collect evidence.The doctors then confirmed she was raped, most likely by more than one person.“[The doctor] said I was one of the worst cases she’s seen with how violent it was,” the victim said. “The next day I had a fat lip, I couldn’t move my jaw and I had a bruise on my face. I had bruises up and down my legs and by my vagina, so it wasn’t consensual or anything — it was really violent.”To this day, the victim has no idea who her assaulters were.“If I did, they would be going to jail,” the victim said. “I’d press charges. I have a police investigation going on. If I knew who they were, I would be putting those fuckers in jail.”According to the Madison Police Department, there are still no suspects in the victim’s case.A long road to recoveryFive months later, the victim is still fighting to regain pieces of herself she fears have been taken away forever.While the victim has had the support of friends, family and weekly visits to a therapist, she said she struggles every day with the reality that most people do not understand the full impact the assault has had on her life.Every day of the week, she faces issues concerning trust and security. Visiting the doctor has become a terrifying experience, and simply being in the same room with a male is stressful.“Now, I’m very wary of all men in general, and that was taken from me — I used to be very good friends with guys. … It’s just something that I will never in my life get back. Like, I still take showers and still try to scrub myself off because I still feel dirty,” the victim said.The victim went on to say she now has an entirely different view of going out. She is vigilant about watching her drinks, carries roofie testers and above all else is aware of who is looking out for her safety.The pledge and two members of Sigma Chi she went out with that night were not close friends, she added.The three left her playing beer pong with several men in Sigma Chi, though the victim only knows this from speaking with eyewitnesses.“The girl just left me; she was like, ‘I gotta go home,’ and she left,” the victim said. “And honestly, that’s fine, but looking back, I’m never going to do that to someone, because something could happen. I’m sure she thought, ‘Oh, you’re safe here, you’re fine, we know people here.’ But you really just don’t know everybody.”The university reactsAfter the assault, the victim went home for a week to begin her recovery.“I didn’t go to school,” she said. “I was really depressed and felt violated, and I couldn’t believe that something like this happened to me.”Soon after arriving at home, the victim was contacted by Yolanda Garza, an assistant dean at the Offices of the Dean of Students.When MPD or Meriter alerts the ODOS of a sexual assault, the university’s policy is to extend options for action to the victim and aid him or her with support and assistance, according to Dean of Students Lori Berquam.However, the victim alleges Garza and the university were of no help to her in the months following her assault.She said she was never asked if she wished to pursue an investigation through the university, adding Garza was not empathetic to her situation.“[Garza] knew full well I was having a private investigator,” the victim said. “Doesn’t that say you want to do something? I feel like it should have been asked, too. I was never asked, “Do you want them to get in trouble at all?'”According to Berquam, the university contacts professors on behalf of crime victims to allow extensions on academic material.However, the victim said she was forced to personally e-mail her professors and explain she had been a victim of rape to receive increased extensions.Berquam responded the university’s actions are a result of very intentional efforts to help the victim regain control of his or her life.“If someone doesn’t act like they need [help] or articulate what they need, it’s again one of those things where we don’t want to force ourselves on it. That’s one of the last things you want to do when someone’s been a victim — it’s a re-victimization,” Berquam said.She said if a student is unhappy with how their assigned dean is handling things, they are invited to contact the ODOS to request a switch.“I would like to think I hold my staff to very high standards, and I believe strongly in my staff and I believe strongly in terms of their advocacy and support of students,” Berquam said.Berquam went on to defend Garza as a well-respected and decorated sexual assault counselor, adding she has helped countless victims in her time at UW.“It happens all the time”In the end, the victim urged students to be careful when going out and to think about the possible consequences of risky behavior.This means limiting drinking and always having a close friend to keep an eye on you.“[Rape is] not just stuff you see in movies. It happens all the time, and most of it’s shushed up because that’s what as a society we’re taught to feel. You never think it will happen to you and it will,” the victim said.Berquam said she hopes more victims come forward.“I know, I absolutely know, this is an underreported crime,” Berquam said. “If more victims come forward, I hope we have open arms to accept them [at ODOS] to provide them the support that they need. This is a critical college issue, a critical issue on our campus.”Related Stories: Alleged rape at Sigma ChiTranscript of Herald’s interview with rape victim","Victim comes forward, reveals shocking story",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2017/11/07/body-hate-and-eating-disorders-paired-with-pressures-of-campus-plague-the-minds-of-uw-students/,"Nov 7, 2017","I looked up to meet the doctor’s eyes. I knew the question before she asked. Suddenly, I became hyper-aware of the overpowering smell of disinfectant, coating every surface of the emergency room.“Have you been eating?”I lied, obviously. Any lie comes easy if you repeat enough, and easier once you believe it. But draped in a hospital gown, the lie tasted bitter.I realized it was the first time I had tasted anything in a long time.More than 91 percent of women in the United States are unhappy with their bodies. Magazine covers gleam with dieting tricks and exercise routines, playing on the accurate assumption that these concerns plague nearly every woman.  On a college campus, the compounded effects of academic stress and constant comparison with peers only amplify the issue of body insecurity.The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders identifies three major eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. U.S. prevalence rates are 0.3 percent, 1 percent and 3 percent, respectively.According to the 2015 National College Health Assessment report, 0.6 percent of University of Wisconsin students have been diagnosed with, or sought treatment, for anorexia — twice the national average.But statistics fail to reflect the magnitude of body hate, disordered eating, fat talk and insecurity pulsing in the veins of a college campus. This story remains untold by aggregate data. It is silent suffering. It is unbearably painful.UW senior Andrea Collins, a psychology major, recalls her earliest memory of disordered thoughts and eating in fourth grade.“I can’t remember a time I was comfortable with my body. I had friends who I thought were way prettier and skinnier than I ever would be,” Collins said. “The first day I starved myself, I called them to proudly claim I ate nothing but a granola bar.”Collins’ experience is consistent with the profile of most eating disorders. Some people are already genetically susceptible, and environmental factors — such as the media — begin to have an effect at a young age, UW psychology assistant professor and researcher James Li said.The distressing reality is that by the time many girls begin to understand their bodies, they have begun to criticize their bodies, UW senior Bridget Sicard said.For UW alumna Emily Rhodes, the trauma of losing a parent triggered already aggressive dangerous, distorted thoughts.“I was in second grade, keeping a diary of my weight and what I ate,” Rhodes said. “In my life, I have never had a good body image.”Andrea Lawson, co-director of mental health services at UHS, said disordered eating often starts as a coping mechanism to manage stress or family issues.“I would compare myself to every single girl that walked by me on the street — ‘what do her legs, arms, butt look like?’ — and I would compare it to myself … It consumed my thoughts.”
Bridget Sicard“During a major transition, a switch gets flipped, and it turns into an eating disorder you no longer have control over,” Lawson said. “And college campuses are prime for that.”Upon arriving at UW, Sicard navigated campus as if wearing a radar.“I would compare myself to every single girl that walked by me on the street — ‘what do her legs, arms, butt look like?’ — and I would compare it to myself. I ran through this every day. It consumed my thoughts,” Sicard said.The 2015 Healthy Minds survey, conducted nationwide, found 19.7 percent of UW students screen positively for an eating disorder. Put another way, Lawson said, if you know five students on campus, you know one who screens positive for an eating disorder.A positive screen for an eating disorder does not imply diagnosis, but a heightened risk for dangerous behaviors.Comparison and competition are defining features of the campus setting, Lawson said. In addition, extreme behaviors from drinking, to sleeping, to eating, to exercise become normalized.“At their core, campuses are so competitive in so many different realms. There are measurable ones, like grades, athletics, internship experience,” Collins said. “But there are also those you can’t measure past your own perception, and body image is one of those things.”After struggling with disordered thoughts and behaviors throughout high school, Sicard found herself immersed in this atmosphere. Terrorized by the “freshman 15,” she lost her sense of control, and began binging.Chanda Bolander, coordinator of Eating Disorder Services at UHS, said fear of the “freshman 15” causes a heightened anxiety that can turn into an eating disorder.“I was delusional, convinced I was truly overweight when I truly was not.”
Jeung Bok HolmquistBut this fear is rooted in myth. Numerous studies on health and bodies have repeatedly found the “freshman 15” is nothing more than a parable, Lawson said. Average weight change is around five pounds — normal for freshmen-aged women who are still going through puberty.But some still experience body hate, regardless of the number on the scale. UW senior Jeung Bok Holmquist, a film major, said entering college transformed their obsession with weight to an obsession with appearance.“The body dysmorphia was constant,” Holmquist said. “I was delusional, convinced I was truly overweight when I truly was not.”Body dysmorphic disorder is a body image disorder characterized by persistent, intrusive preoccupations with an imagined deficit in one’s appearance. While not necessarily linked to weight, BDD often occurs with eating disorders.And for someone with very low body image, at high risk for developing BDD, the campus environment can be the trigger. UW junior Kyra, who asked to be identified by her first name only, was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in seventh grade. She spent six months in treatment prior to college before dropping her weight once again during her first semester.From living in a dorm to rushing a sorority, being exposed to people who all seemed happy and beautiful was overwhelming, Kyra said. And post-anorexia treatment, many people develop bulimic tendencies.“Living in a dorm, sharing bathrooms, sometimes deterred my behavior,” Kyra said. “But so often, you overhear someone judging another person as fat or ugly … It was very triggering. I felt I could be that girl they were talking about.”A range of factors, including stress and isolation, make college campuses a hotbed for several mental health issues, said Sandra Eugster, founder of Westside Psychotherapy outpatient clinic in Madison.“If you’re not told your cognitions are distorted or your behavior is concerning, then in the college setting, body expectations overshadow more rational thoughts about appropriate exercising and eating,” Lawson said.Will Cox, assistant scientist in the psychology department, studies the effects of fat-shaming. On campus, while fat-shaming may not be overt, a serious concern is “fat-talk” among peers.“We have young women who get together — each girl talks casually about how fat she thinks she, but it actually has negative effects on [the others],” Cox said. “The way you talk about yourself affects how others feel about themselves.”Women are used to talking poorly about themselves, and it’s highly contagious, Sicard said. This also heightens risk for social reinforcement of dangerous behavior. Girls often severely restrict intake before a night of drinking to save calories, exercise serves as punishment for unhealthy eating and fashion choices become driven by how clothes reflect body weight rather than aesthetic preference.The strain on women to appear as thin as possible also stems from the uninvited, persistent hyper-sexualization of the female body, Kyra said. The worthiness of a woman, so deeply intertwined with her desirability, leaves girls feeling pathetic or irrelevant if they aren’t “sexy.”While men are not subject to the same standards, they aren’t immune to body insecurity and disordered eating. UW senior Matt Grande, a psychology major, struggled with body image throughout high school, and has engaged in restrictive behaviors during college.For men, the pressure is not to be skinny, but the polar opposite, Grande said. The male narrative is centered around exercise. Instead of expressing their insecurities, men become obsessed with working out.“I know men experience it, but we never talk about it,” Grande said.For marginalized students, body shape becomes yet another dimension on which they don’t belong.The alienation minority students already face because of their identities can elevate the risk of body hate, UW sophomore Saja Bilasan, who is majoring in psychology and gender and women’s studies, said.“The lack of body diversity is the main problem. I see so many girls here with the same body type and it’s the one associated with being beautiful.”
Saja BilasanBilasan, who identifies as Arab, said her body image challenges intensified in college, where she began a pattern of restrictive eating and binging.“The lack of body diversity is the main problem. I see so many girls here with the same body type and it’s the one associated with being beautiful,” Bilasan said. “Too many body positivity campaigns all center on white women.”As a result, it can still feel like there is no right way for a woman of color to have a body, Bilasan said.Holmquist, who is Japanese, describes their standard experience scanning a lecture hall — an experience shared with many students of color at UW.“You sit in a 100-person lecture and you see all these skinny, white girls with the same clothes, the same body … and you realize, I will forever not look like them,” Holmquist said.While eating disorders have been historically perceived as a plight for white women, Bolanger said the demographic picture of UW students seeking treatment from UHS confirms eating disorders do not discriminate. Eating disorders are not gender-specific, she said, nor do they vary by race or class.UW senior Sam*, who identifies as a gay man, found that coming out in college exacerbated pressure to fit a certain body type. The societal expectation is that gay men are skinny, Sam said. But striking that balance between “not-too-muscular” and “not-too-scrawny” is near-impossible.But the LGBTQ+ community can also be a protective factor. This was the case for Holmquist, when they transitioned to identifying as non-binary.“The gay women I hang out with are so loving, accepting of their bodies,” Holmquist said. “I think we’ve unlearned some of what straight women are taught, which hinges on obsession with male gaze.”Unfortunately, not all students have the support of family or community, UW alumna Ameerah*, said. As a Muslim and first-generation American, she knew discussing this incredibly stigmatized disorder with parents would only catalyze arguments and denial.The tremendous stigma and shame associated with eating disorders contributes to what Eugster sees as a real disparity between eating disorder statistics and reality.Most people suffering from eating disorders or disordered eating are not seeking treatment, which makes it increasingly difficult to understand the magnitude of the problem, Eugster said.The complexity with eating disorders is how easily they can manipulate the mind into believing these are healthy, goal-achieving mechanisms, since they are very functional in the short-term. In reality, Lawson said, an eating disorder is a separate part of you, sabotaging your goals and identity.“The difficulty is pulling the two apart — what is me, and what is my eating disorder,” Lawson said.An additional danger is the large subset of students on campus who don’t seek treatment because they don’t meet the criteria for the disorders, but continue harming themselves.And waiting for symptoms to appear before seeking help can be deadly. UW junior, math and geography major Claire, who chose to be identified by her first name only, recalls distress when she experienced amenorrhea, the loss of menstruation diagnosed in anorexic patients.“I remember thinking, ‘I started this because I wanted to be healthy, and now I’m not sure I can have a child’,” Claire said.To serve this population, eating disorder treatment at UHS is not exclusively administered to students who are diagnosed with an eating disorder, Bolanger said. People don’t always fit into the boxes built by DSM criteria.Treatment starts with a phone call discussing symptoms and service options. UHS offers individual counseling, brief treatment and group therapy, Lawson said. Group therapy can be especially helpful since eating disorders are “disorders of secrecy.” It can be helpful to talk to others who have experienced the same thing.But for Rhodes, the fear of not being taken seriously prevented her from utilizing group therapy offered by UHS.“I went to UHS and they offered group therapy, but I didn’t want to do that,” Rhodes said. “I feared I’d walk in, and I’m not really small, so people would think I didn’t really have a problem.”While UHS can offer services within its scope, patients requiring more intensive therapy are referred to outpatient clinics, like Westside, where Eugster approximates nearly 30 percent of clientele are UW students. Full-blown anorexia is not so common, but there are a huge number of women hyper-exercising and under-eating, Eugster said.This is consistent with the narrative of many UW students, who are restricting, binging and purging without diagnosis, but require treatment nonetheless.“I would sit down with another chair in front of me and talk to my eating disorder. I needed to tell myself it was not a part of me.”
Andrea CollinsKyra, still in the process of recovery, believes prevention efforts are critical. Restrictive behaviors are reversible, but the firm grasp of negative thoughts, even after treating the behavioral component, is powerful.Recovery requires nourishment, Li said.The effects of being undernourished mirror exhaustion. The daily rigors of life and difficulty concentrating or handling stress, paired with the disordered cognitions consuming the mind, put the body in a state of weakness which is unreceptive to therapy, Li said.But after restoring the body, recovery of the mind is possible.“I would sit down with another chair in front of me and talk to my eating disorder,” Collins said. “I needed to tell myself it was not a part of me and I could overcome it, with an action plan.”When it comes to awareness, a general sense that many classmates also feel insecure about their bodies is inadequate, Collins said. Complacency and acceptance that body hate and restrictive eating are simply part of the college experience fuel the continuation of this epidemic.“The university should be talking about this to freshman,” Kyra said. “We talk about sexual assault and substance abuse, and these dangerous behaviors are happening on a similar level.”For Sicard, and the many others on campus who share her experience, eventually realizing that she had control over nothing but treating herself with love ultimately began her healing process.Recovery is a lifestyle, not a destination. Inevitable ups and downs, relapses and moments of weakness do not negate progress.“We all come in different bodies, and there is so much beauty in each body we don’t appreciate,” Bilasan said. “Learning to appreciate my own individuality definitely helped me. That’s what healed me.”***If you are concerned about your eating behaviors, or those of someone you care about, please visit UHS for support. *Names have been changed to protect the privacy of some sources who have experienced eating disorders.","Body hate and eating disorders, paired with pressures of campus, plague the minds of UW students",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2018/01/23/voices-of-change-uw-political-organizers-seek-to-push-protest-tradition-forward/,"Jan 23, 2018","Dale Altshuler was walking down Bascom Hill in October 1967. She heard the chants of students protesting the Vietnam War, something pretty normal since she had seen protesters before.But soon the chants turned to screams.Students started scattering in all directions, police chasing after them with billy clubs and shields.Students flee from police officers spreading tear gas outside the Commerce Building (now Ingraham Hall) at a protest against Dow Chemical.
Courtesy of UW ArchivesThen, Altshuler, a junior at the time, was hit with tear gas. Her eyes and nose burned in “agony,” but worse yet, she couldn’t get away. The gas was in the very air she was trying to breathe.“I was totally traumatized,” Altshuler remembers. “I was crying — I couldn’t stop crying.”“It felt like I could participate with a group of people and really have an influence. We ended the war.”
Alan RobockStudents had staged a sit in at the Commerce Building (now Ingraham Hall) to protest Dow Chemical, a company that was creating napalm for the Vietnam War and recruiting students on campus. Police ended the protest by beating and tear gassing students, even bystanders like Altshuler who were leaving class.At the time, Altshuler didn’t know what was happening. Before that day, she said she was in “her own little world” and didn’t pay attention to protests or the war. But after that day she became an activist. Even with the “unbearable” tear gas, she attended many more protests, and worked with her fellow students to support the anti-war effort.  But some “cynics” said student protests were useless, according to an April 1972 statement from the Wisconsin Student Association. UW alumnus Alan Robock, who also participated in the Vietnam protests, said students had no right to expect they could change anything — but they did.“It really felt empowering. It felt like I could participate with a group of people and really have an influence,” Robock said. “We ended the war.”Students taking part in a candlelight vigil to protest the Vietnam War in the Library Mall in 1972.
Courtesy of UW ArchivesWhether it be helping to end a war, raising awareness about racism or pushing for changes in school policies, students have proven themselves to be forces of change throughout UW’s history. But changes almost never come easily. Students often have to fight tooth and nail to have their causes listened to, let alone for change to occur.Vice Provost Lori Berquam said this grit and passion for activism in students is part of UW’s identity.“It’s really part of who we are is that concept of being passionate about social issues, being passionate about making our world a better place,” Berquam said. “That level of passion that contributes to activism is what I think makes our campus unique.”RILEY STEINBRENNER/The Badger HeraldToday, students continue this tradition, employing tactics tailored to their causes as well as themselves.Some employ direct actions to push for very specific changes, like recent UW graduate Brooke Evans and UW sophomore Rena Newman. As soon as Evans heard about the mandatory minimum that was a part of UW’s new dining policy, she knew she had to act.“In an article that was released about this policy change … I was tagged in it, and it said ‘@Brooke Evans, please help,’” Evans said. “And so then I immediately opened the article and was altogether stunned and immediately began drafting … my own version of what I thought a petition would look like.”Evans, a long-standing advocate of student hunger and homelessness and someone who has experienced it herself, was joined by Newman, who contributed to the cause with their passion for writing. Finding a niche in any movement, Newman said, is key to being a successful activist.In part, because of the 3,500 signatures they were able to amass, a group of students were able to meet with University Housing Director Jeff Novak and get the policy removed from the plan.Other students, such as Cortez de la Cruz and Eneale Pickett employ disruptive tactics which draw attention to their causes and evoke discussion.“At some point, people have to suffer publically for things to become relevant in the minds of other people.”
Brooke EvansDe la Cruz, a UW senior, has been involved in planning speaker protests against figures like Ben Shapiro, a blockade of UW’s 2016 homecoming parade to promote Black Lives Matter as well as being involved in the multimedia #TheRealUW project.“We understand what pushes buttons,” de la Cruz said. “With organizing, we never want to come across as too aggressive and that we can’t conduct ourselves. But you have to make sure that your actual feelings are coming across that this is an important issue to you.”Part of this, he said, is making sure each demonstration has a specific set of demands and working with entities like UWPD to ensure protests go smoothly.Through his clothing line Insert Apparel, Pickett, a UW junior, creates t-shirts, hats and hoodies, bearing messages like “All White People Are Racist” as well as visual projects. Each has stirred difficult, often uneasy dialogues about white supremacy and sexism on campus, as well as garnered attention from outlets like The Washington Post.NOLAN FERLIC/The Badger HeraldThough Pickett has a knack for stirring controversy, he maintains that each garment contains nothing that has not been said before.“What I’m saying on my shirt is nothing new,” Pickett says. “People have been saying this forever, I just decided to put it on a shirt.”For each of these students, regardless of cause and action, each related that no matter the action, each is planned meticulously in advance. For Newman and Evans, this meant conversing with other food scarcity advocates and concerned parties before pursuing Evans’ idea for a petition.For de la Cruz, this means a week of planning sessions to make sure everyone is on the same page. For Pickett, it means months of research into the ideologies he chooses to manifest in his fashion.  “Success is never going to come quick.”
Cortez de la CruzEach activist also described the necessity to take an intersectional and reflective approach when organizing. Newman said it’s especially important to reflect and listen when advocating for a cause that does not affect you specifically, as Newman does with food scarcity.“Being humble and saying ‘I don’t know’ is crucial,” Newman said. “But you have to also keep in mind that no one is obligated to educate you.”While many see activism as something that only progressives take part in, College Republicans Chair Jake Lubenow said conservatives also have their ways of making change. Lubenow said College Republicans has strong ties to the state Legislature and are able to communicate their priorities with lawmakers. College Republicans communicated with lawmakers about the importance of having an opt-out option for student segregated fees. The legislature did not include that option in this budget, but Lubenow said they were receptive to making plans for that in the future. Each also said though change is possible, it is also often met with challenges. Though the tear gas and billy clubs of the Vietnam era are absent, students encounter death threats on social media, divides between themselves and the administration and changing social climates in the 21st century.Student activists face challenges that range from having to work tirelessly to ensure one’s voice is heard to receiving death threats because of their views.Both Pickett and de la Cruz have experienced the latter. De la Cruz said his profile on campus has also led to some askance glances and other microaggressions, though he noted, by this point, he is more or less used to them.UW officials unveil initiatives to address campus racial climate
University of Wisconsin officials announced 18 initiatives Wednesday with the goal of achieving diversity and inclusivity on UW’s campus. Chancellor Read…Another major obstacle is simply getting people to listen.When Evans was trying to get Associated Students of Madison to adopt a food pantry for low income and homeless students on campus, ASM didn’t think it was worth the time. She had to come out publicly as a homeless student for them to pass the motion. Evans said it’s hard for people to care about something they’ve never seen or experienced.“At some point, people have to suffer publically for things to become relevant in the minds of other people,” Evans said. “You almost have to watch and know and hear that someone is bleeding out loud.”But even after speaking publicly about her homelessness, some still didn’t care. Important issues for low income students like getting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on campus or getting socio-economic status recognized in the hate and bias policy as a recognized identity were often joked about as “Brooke issues,” rather than serious problems. Evans said her experiences trying to create change have been “labor intensive, emotionally exhausting and almost sanity trying.”Flamingo Run now accepting SNAP benefits

He added, people are people. Many will be receptive, but some have “core values” that are out of reach.Another common challenge that student changemakers face is that most issues cannot be solved overnight, especially societal ones.“Success is never going to come quick, especially when we’re dealing with systems of power,” de la Cruz said.Despite Berquam’s pride in UW’s tradition of protest, many student activists feel there is a rift between themselves and the administration.Pickett said he is fatigued by the times he has contacted the university and not received a response.Evans said she has had meetings with UW officials where promises have been made to her and have not been followed through on.Assistant Vice Chancellor Argyle Wade acknowledged that listening to students is an area in which administration is always trying to improve.“It’s hard to be connected and included into all the different voices and opinions and thoughts. It’s an ongoing, constant struggle,” Wade said. “There would be no way to say that we’re able to listen to everybody all the time — it’s a huge place. We’re always trying to get better. I don’t think I would ever say that’s something that we could not be still better on.”If students don’t feel listened to, Wade said he would want students to come forward and say, “‘hey, I think my voice hasn’t been heard on this,’” so the administration can listen.But sometimes the fastest and most effective way to make a change within the university is to solve problems with faculty and staff, rather than taking issues all the way up to administration. Berquam said there are many issues that could be solved with professors or department heads rather than administrators. She pointed to the changes to the recent dining hall policy as a recent example of this.“It’s so interesting to me when people are like, ‘nothing changes.’ Every time you look around, there are changes.”
Lori BerquamNovak said he met with ASM to get feedback on the new dining hall payment plan before the policy was announced. Novak also met with students after the backlash and had conversations about the petition. Housing made the policy a pilot program, instead of a permanent policy, and allowed student funds to be rolled over because of these conversations.University Housing modifies meal plan policy to include opt out option
University of Wisconsin Dining Services has modified their meal plan policy after backlash from students, faculty and alumni. The plan originally Read…Evans, however, is still frustrated with the university’s response and plans to advocate for further changes.Berquam said one reason students may be frustrated with the changes that happen is because they may simply be unhappy with the outcome — not necessarily because they weren’t listened to. Wade said they have to balance the interests of all students, alumni, Madison residents and the state of Wisconsin.“Sometimes on one issue we’ll have multiple perspectives on what’s the right direction, what’s the right thing to do,” Wade said. “And you can only pick one sometimes.”For instance, in 2014 when the state Legislature made budget cuts to the UW System, UW officials spoke out against the cuts. Many Democratic students lauded UW’s stance against the cuts, but conservative students wanted the university to remain impartial, Lubenow said. Lubenow said College Republicans made requests for the university to stay objective, but these requests “fell on deaf ears.”$250 million cut to UW System remains as Assembly passes state budget

Scott Walker’s desk, passing the Read…De la Cruz wishes there were more avenues for communication with the university, and feels even when they start to initiate changes they are more so placations rather than long-term solutions.Similarly, graduate student CV Vitolo-Haddad, who is a member of the activist group Student Coalition for Progress, said the most effective way SCP has found for getting the university’s attention is by getting issues to have national media coverage.Still, there are countless examples of changes to the university that have come about because of student requests, most of which did not garner national news coverage.Berquam pointed to the Our Wisconsin program, online and in-person training to raise awareness about sexual assault, the hate and bias reporting system, the Black Cultural Center, changes to Rec Sports, the renovation Memorial Union, making College Library 24 hours and adding more mental health counselors at UHS as just some of the changes the university has made that have been driven by student input.“It’s so interesting to me when people are like, ‘nothing changes,’” Berquam said. “Every time you look around, there are changes.”UW community celebrates end to Black History Month, beginning of Black Cultural Center
Marking the end of Black History Month, the University of Wisconsin community celebrated a dedication and libation ceremony for the Read…One thing that has helped students facilitate change is social media.“Social media plays a big role in organizing,” de la Cruz said. “It allows us to reach out to people and also serve as another place to ensure our voices are heard.”KATIE COONEY/The Badger HeraldDe la Cruz added social media gives protests an added dimension, another space where things like demands and relevant information can be posted. At one point, he posted a death threat he’d received on social media, in order to demonstrate the causes he was advocating against were both harmful and serious.Newman and Evans were able to link up rapidly and communicate with others because of social media, videos and images of Pickett’s clothing line were spread and discussed on social media and #TheRealUW based much of its trajectory in online visual images of students posting what UW really means to them.But social media comes with both positive and negative effects.UW journalism and mass communications professor Chris Wells, an expert in how people use social media to participate in politics, said it’s easy for people to fall in the trap of simply following groups and updates, but then “clicking off” and not participating in them. Wells said it’s important that activists have both an online and in-person presence for a social movement to be sustained.In addition, since it’s so easy to organize via social media, some may see protests as less impactful than in the past when gathering thousands of people came from flyers on telephone lines, Wells said.Wells, though, is confident that certain students will continue to be politically active and use social media as an avenue for political success.But even if “success” in the sense of sweeping, societal changes are not achieved, the success of a protest can be measured in a variety of ways.Vitolo-Haddad said SCP sees simply getting their message out there to people as a success. They’ve been able to have their voices heard by being picked up by media outlets and getting more students to register to vote.Protest can also take on a more personal role in the lives of students, becoming a part of who they are as individuals.“It’s success stories that inspire me and keep me going.”
Eneale PickettWhen de la Cruz began as a student at UW, he suffered from being in “a dark place,” one where some mornings he could not bring himself to get up in the morning.Organization, for him, became a way to not simply fight for causes he believes in but also stay away from that dark place.Pickett, who has also received numerous death threats, said though organization takes a toll on the self, he is motivated to continue by interactions he has with his supporters.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/11/09/trump-johnson-sweep-wisconsin-in-historic-night-for-republicans/,"Nov 9, 2016","In a historic sweep of battleground states that blindsided pollsters and analysts, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed victory early Wednesday — shocking the political establishment and becoming the first Republican to win Wisconsin in a presidential election since 1984.The unprecedented Trump victory led to a GOP wave in Wisconsin, with U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson winning his re-election bid by even wider margins than Trump and state Republicans poised to expand their majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature.In a victory speech that was more mellow than his usual stump speech rhetoric, Trump struck a conciliatory tone as he told supporters that Democrat Hillary Clinton called him to concede.“The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,” Trump told a hall of cheering supporters in Manhattan.Clinton did not make a concession speech.Pre-election polling consistently had Clinton leading the country and the state, and the Democratic nominee didn’t make a single stop in Wisconsin after losing in the state primaries in April.The latest Marquette University Law School poll, for example, had Clinton with a 46 percent to 40 percent lead over Trump. Barry Burden, a University of Wisconsin political science professor, said it remains unclear how the polls both here and nationally failed to predict a Trump victory.“There was almost never a poll with Trump tied or ahead, so something has gone fundamentally wrong here,” Burden said. “I tend to think it’s a Trump-specific phenomena. He has just defied all the conventions and expectations we have in electoral politics.”Trump pulled major wins in Florida and Ohio, setting him on a path to the 270 electoral college votes necessary to claim the presidency relatively early in the night. The rust belt states that Trump hailed as strongholds for his campaign despite lackluster polls, including Wisconsin and Michigan, were too close to call until early Wednesday morning. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Trump remained two points ahead in Wisconsin.In Dane County, Trump took just 23 percent of the vote compared with Clinton’s 70 percent, but a landslide in the state’s second most populous county was not enough to counter the Republican sweep of rural areas. Neither was the vote in heavily-Democratic Milwaukee County, where 66 percent of voters supported Clinton..@CityofMadison Ald.Mike Verveer says this is the highest turnout of students in all his years as an election official @BadgerHerald— Alice Vagun (@a_vagoon) November 8, 2016Johnson, meanwhile, outperformed Trump in the state with his five-point victory over Democratic challenger Russ Feingold, whom Johnson had ousted from the Senate in 2010. The Oshkosh Republican was one in a stream of Senate GOP incumbents to keep their seats, dashing Democrats’ hopes of snagging a majority in the chamber.Republicans swept the state Legislature, boosting their majorities in both the Senate and the Assembly. Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, was up by only dozens of votes in her race against former Sen. Dan Kapanke and claimed victory after 3:30 a.m. Wednesday.Gov. Scott Walker, who lost against Trump in the Republican primaries but supported him in the general election, said leaders ought to look to Wisconsin for reform approaches.“Tonight is a win for taxpayers and a win for America,” Walker said.Gov.

Though students had to leave as the bar closed at around 11 p.m., chairman Alex Walker, the governor’s son, said he was confident and optimistic about the outcome.Walker said he was pleased with the high turnout of students for the viewing party. He said even if Clinton were to win the race, they would all still be excited about the results of the U.S. Senate and House elections.“We’re ready to work together with whoever the president is going to be,” Alex Walker said. “A lot of College Republicans feel that way. Whoever the president is, that’s our president. It’s all of our’s president, not just one side’s president.”Were Republicans to take the White House as well, Alex Walker said Trump would initially face challenges bringing people together.“Obviously, this has been a polarizing, dividing election, and it looks like neither candidate will win with 50 percent of the [popular] vote,” Alex Walker said. “In some way, they’re going to have to work together to make sure that everyone knows they are our president, no matter who it is, and they represent everyone in this country.”Some College Republicans were surprised by the results, including Emelia Rohl. She said she did not initially think the race would be so close or that Trump would ultimately win.Confidence at the event grew throughout the evening, with support rising to a deafening cheer when Fox News first reported Johnson made gains against Feingold.While Feingold’s watch party at the Marriott Madison West in Middleton was festive early in the evening, it quickly turned somber shortly after he conceded to Johnson.Early on, most national pundits didn’t give Johnson high chances. But the polls in recent weeks predicted a tight race as Feingold looked to reclaim his Senate seat.Feingold seemed jarred as he took the stage, alluding to early indications of a Trump presidency.Dane County Board stands in solidarity with Muslim community

Though more than 90 percent of first-year students choose to live in University Residence Halls due to convenience and the desire to get the “college experience” of living in a dorm, the university continues to overcharge its students into undesirable and unequal residence halls.More than 2,000 students each year live in the infamous Sellery and Witte Residence Halls. Not only are these halls unsanitary and conventionally unattractive, they are in many ways unsafe. At least one of the two elevators in Sellery B Tower last year was consistently malfunctioning. Witte Residence Hall was known to have a cockroach problem last year, and the constant construction still going on often inconveniences residents.This is not to say that all residence halls are like this: Ogg Residence Hall and Smith Residence Hall are both well-known for their large rooms with tall ceilings and walk-in closets.

With the addition of a required meal plan, new students living in the residence halls are charged at minimum $9,550 for the school year, with prices ranging all the way up to $11,550. Considering the fact tuition for in-state students is around the same price, this is simply ridiculous.The final problem with University Housing is its lack of options for students who do not want to share a bedroom with others. Though certain residence halls have single rooms, living completely alone as a first-year student is very intimidating and not something most students want. The University Apartments located in Eagle Heights and other parts of campus is for “UW-Madison graduate students, students with families, postdoctoral researchers, academic staff, and faculty,” and the university offers no kind of “suite-style” living or on-campus apartments for undergraduate students.Chryst’s punishment of Davis for involvement in sexual assault fails to meet moral standards

University of Wisconsin sophomore and First Wave scholar Eneale Pickett is no longer saying, whispering or asking “Can I please be given access to this space?”He is kicking down the door and getting into that space whether people like it or not.Pickett, a Chicago native and elementary education major, has created a clothing line called Insert Apparel, which focuses on engaging people in critical discussions on the intersectional issues of race, gender and sexuality on campus.ALICE VAGUN/The Badger HeraldThe name of the brand comes from the idea that people should “insert” themselves inside serious discussions and find where they can apply themselves to a situation, Pickett said.Some of the clothing features provocative messages such as “All White People Are Racist” and “If I Encounter Another Cop with a God Complex I’m Going to Have to Show the World That They Are Human.”ALICE VAGUN/The Badger HeraldIf these messages make you feel uncomfortable, then Pickett has succeeded in his mission.His work is centered around generating diverse dialogues surrounding race, something that he said can be prompted by discomfort.“For me, growth don’t happen in comfort,” Pickett said.Initially, Insert Apparel was created in response to an incident this past March where a student was spat on and told that students on scholarships did not deserve to be at UW.

Since then, the post has gained 57 shares and hundreds of comments from students on campus and people from across the country.One Facebook user wrote, “If you don’t like white people go back to Africa you piec eof shit [sic]. piss on you and your slave ancestors.”An Etsy user wrote, “Thank your mammy for pickin my butterbeans through you ugly knuckle dragging HIV+ jobless crack smokin fa**ot. … All white people are racist and that’s a good thing.”ALICE VAGUN/The Badger HeraldOne common misunderstanding with the “All White People Are Racist” hoodie is the confusion between prejudice and racism, Pickett said.Racism, Pickett said, deals with discrimination from a group of people who hold power, while prejudice doesn’t require a position of power.“I can be prejudice toward a white person, but will my prejudice affect [them] getting an education, a job or access to spaces where I could make policies?” Pickett said. “Black people have not been in that position of power yet.”In response to the post, Pickett said many students have filed hate and bias reports against him.But Pickett said calling someone a racist doesn’t equate to being called a racial slur.“How is it hate speech if it’s not a racial slur?” Pickett said.Being called a racial slur, Pickett said, brings trauma.“Being called a racist probably brings back the trauma that you inflicted on a race of people,” he said.In photos: #TheRealUW art exhibition raises awareness of marginalized students’ campus experiences

He said he believes the cultural competency initiatives the university have instituted are not enough for the community of color on campus.“This university don’t deserve the students of color because they don’t know how to help them when they are going through traumatic experiences,” Pickett said. “The only way students of color are appreciated here is when they have to show there is diversity.”",UW student receives death threats after debuting new clothing line,UWM

A whopping $86,000.Tracy, along with roommates Travis Ludy and Mitchell Klatt, hosted a house party which, according to an MPD report, attracted over 200 people. Each roommate received 21 charges for encouraging underage alcohol consumption, one count each for alcohol distribution without a permit and 21 citations for procuring alcohol to an underage person, the report added.MPD Sgt. Tony Fiore said the fine was so high because the three roommates encouraged partiers to stay at their house after police arrived. He said police decided to bust the party because they believed the number of people that crammed into the house created a safety hazard.“There was a huge number of people inside in a house that is not equipped in any fashion to handle the number of people,” Fiore said. “We’re not looking through people’s drawers or things like that, we’re looking for people who might be in a medical emergency.”Fiore said the counts against the three students were referred to the city attorney’s office because the incident incurred more costs and charges than the average house party bust.Citations and charges as numerous and large as the North Brooks Street incident are not common to Madison parties, Fiore said. He added the fact the hosts did not voluntarily comply with MPD officers contributed to the large fines.Fiore said a number of alcohol-motivated crimes, including sexual assault, battery and burglaries to the hosts are common with large parties.Ald.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2018/03/07/women-feel-extra-pressure-to-prove-themselves-in-male-dominated-majors/,"Mar 7, 2018","For University of Wisconsin freshman Angela Houghtaling, being one of few girls in her engineering classes is nothing out of the ordinary.During her engineering class last semester, students worked on a 30-foot manual water pump and were supposed to test it at the end of the semester over a stairwell.“It was pretty heavy when we were testing it out, it took a lot of force to operate, but we spent the entire semester planning this and designing and building it,” Houghtaling said.When it came time to test the pump, the professor called each of the male students up but repeatedly overlooked Houghtaling and the only other female student in the class. The professor told the other female student that she was “too small” to operate her pump.When she’d had enough, Houghtaling told her professor she was going to test the pump next because she had worked just as hard all semester as her male classmates. She ended up beating her professor’s time operating the pump.“I had to advocate for myself to be able to test my product,” Houghtaling said.As a biomedical engineering major, Houghtaling is part of a major that has nearly equal numbers of male and female students, with 47 percent of students being women, according to the Office of the Registrar. Still, many of her classes are dominated by men. At UW, women make up 25 percent of the College of Engineering, 17 percent of computer science majors and 40 percent of chemistry majors. In some engineering majors, women make up even fewer percentages, such as computer engineering, where women make up just 13 percent of students.Still, there are some STEM majors where women make up the majority, such as 64 percent of biology and 61 percent of kinesiology.ANNA LARSON/The Badger HeraldThough some of the sciences are seeing an increase in women, female students still feel the pressure to prove themselves in fields that men have historically dominated. As different campus groups push for inclusivity and more female representation in STEM fields, the women in these majors each have different outlooks on what it means to be in the minority.  UW senior and biomedical engineering major Tianna Garcia said she has noticed more microaggressions than outright sexual discrimination in her classes.“It makes me kind of feel like I’m afraid of making mistakes because people could use that as an example that women aren’t capable.”
Olivia LiWomen are often put in positions in which they have to prove themselves to their male colleagues, Garcia said.“[Male colleagues] don’t right away see me as an equal, whether it’s regarding knowledge or just flat out ability,” Garcia said.UW sophomore Olivia Li agreed with Garcia’s sentiments regarding the need to prove herself to her male colleagues. As an electrical engineering major, Li is part of just 14 percent of undergraduate women in that major, according to the Office of the Registrar.Li feels there is a stigma that women in these male-dominated majors are not as capable as men.While doing a class exercise, a male classmate kept asking Li if she knew how to do the problems and said she was working slow. When their scores came back, she had outperformed him.During that encounter, Li felt there was more pressure on her as a female to succeed to prove herself — a pressure she feels her male colleagues have not had to encounter.“It makes me kind of feel like I’m afraid of making mistakes because people could use that as an example that women aren’t capable,” Li said.In group projects, male students will disregard what their female classmates are saying, UW junior and genetics major Katlyn Frane said. Though Frane cannot be completely sure this happens because they are women, she still feels her male classmates undermine her. The thoughts and inputs female students give during a group discussion are often disregarded, or even ignored.Young women’s educational experiences can discourage them from being in a male-dominated field, UW graduate student in computer sciences Ancy Philip said.Philip noticed there is difficulty in retaining women in graduate computer science programs. As a teaching assistant in the undergraduate program, she noticed there are not enough women in her classes and that number is even lower in her graduate classes.While professors often encourage women in their field, Philip has found that whether intentional or not, microaggressions from male classmates are what discourage women.“I feel like women have to work twice as hard as men just to prove themselves,” Philip said.But not all women in these fields feel this way. Emily Tomashek, a chemical engineering major, feels completely comfortable in her male-dominated classes. She attributes this to the fact that she has never been personally discriminated against, but knows many girls who have been.While Tomashek generally prefers to work with other women in class because they seem to be more accepting of mistakes, she rarely feels underestimated while working with male classmates. They treat her as they would treat their other male friends in a classroom setting.Still, Tomashek thinks it would be beneficial to have more women in STEM majors and careers.“If more girls are successful in STEM fields, then the next generation will be able to envision themselves as scientist or engineers and more and more girls will be willing to go into more male-dominated fields,” Tomashek said.These experiences with microaggression and discrimination can continue into a woman’s career.According to the Pew Research Center, 42 percent of women have said they experienced discrimination in the workforce because of their gender.Director of the Masters of Engineering program Sandra Anderson has had a multitude of experiences in male-dominated fields both inside the classroom and in the professional world.Anderson began her educational career at the University of Oklahoma where she received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mechanical engineering. At UW, 14 percent of undergraduate mechanical engineering majors are women.During Anderson’s education, she didn’t experience microaggressions from male colleagues or professors, but that changed when she started her career.While in the professional world, Anderson noticed men are “smart” about what they say and do not outright discriminate or harass their female colleagues. Anderson credits this to the increase in sexual discrimination training many workplaces require of their employees.“I feel like women have to work twice as hard as men just to prove themselves.”
Ancy PhilipAnderson said while gender discrimination against females in these fields may not be as direct, it still happens subtly.In one situation, Anderson accused a boss of discrimination based on her gender, to which he said he had never said anything directly.“I said, ‘You are correct. You have never said anything. You have never said anything positive about my work. You have never put me in for a raise or promotion, you have never had my back,’” Anderson said.In another situation, Anderson said a boss was angry with her for not being “subordinative enough.”Women who want to go into engineering or other male-dominated fields should choose something they enjoy, Anderson said. Because then when someone says something, it won’t really matter.“If you’re doing what you enjoy doing, then it won’t bother you so much if somebody said something,” Anderson said. “If you’ve got one person here or there that says something, you’re still going to get to do what you want.”The challenges of getting more women into science-related fields stem from a history of women being overlooked and undervalued in the workforce.Historically, women in STEM fields have not had an easy time, UW history of women in technology professor Marie Hicks said.Women began working in technology when computing and programming first began in the 1940’s, Hicks said. It was seen as “just using machines” and not very important, so women should do it.“Adults contribute to gender socialization. They shunt girls and women into areas they’ve traditionally been in.”
Janet HydeThat changed in the 1960’s when computers began to be recognized as “powerful,” Hicks said. There was a gender labor flip in the U.S.“[The flip] pushes women out of the field and pushes young men, who actually don’t have any technical skills, into those jobs,” Hicks said.While people may believe women have gradually worked their way into STEM fields, that’s not exactly how it is in reality, Hicks said.Women receiving degrees in computer science peaked in the mid-’80s and declined until about 2008, Hicks said. The trend then came back up a little bit in the following years and is now starting to decline slightly again.“In a way that’s good because we can look back on history and say, ‘how did we get into this mess?’ and come up with better answers to get out of this mess,” Hicks said.While women have made progress since the ‘60s, there are still structural problems within the STEM field, Hicks said.A common statistic regarding the gender pay gap is that women make 79 cents to a man’s dollar, according to a 2016 report from Senate Joint Economic Committee Democratic Staff. But UW economics professor Timothy Smeeding said there is a lot more behind this statistic than meets the eye.The report said women earn 79 percent of what men earn, but this statistic is simply a ratio of women’s median earnings to men’s median earnings, UW economics professor Barbara Wolfe said in an email to The Badger Herald. It doesn’t directly compare earnings of a man and woman in the same position, doing the same work, Smeeding said. There are more nuanced issues at play than simply raising women’s wages.This statistic does not take into account the fact that women are often the ones who take time off work for children, Wolfe said. The gap tends to be bigger for those in prime childbearing years.Gender and women’s studies and psychology professor Janet Hyde said women also often go into fields like teaching and social work because they want to make a difference and feel welcome, but these fields also tend to be underpaid and undervalued.While Hyde said women should go into these types of fields if they want to, parents and teachers tend to socialize women to push them into these fields — something Hyde said can discourage women from going into STEM fields.“Adults contribute to gender socialization,” Hyde said. “They shunt girls and women into areas they’ve traditionally been in.”But women should not think they are not smart enough or focus on what they cannot do, Hicks said. Instead, they should band together.Women in the workforce can create unions to pool their power, Hicks said. Students can also get together to create things like educational initiatives to better fit their needs.“Power is only real if exercised,” Hicks said.Given the fact that women were behind in the job force for so long because they were not allowed to be as highly educated as men, women are making up ground in the economy fairly quickly, Smeeding said.While there is still room for improvement, women are better now economically than they have ever been, Smeeding added.“The future for women is bright,” Smeeding said.Professors, students and campus leaders are taking a variety of approaches to encourage more women to join STEM fields and to ensure women feel confident in them.Engineering physics professor Todd Allen, who has also taught nuclear engineering classes, believes the low number of women in the field is keeping it from being as creative as it can be because many different views are missing. The engineering department is actively trying to recruit women.Allen also said he makes sure he doesn’t treat his female students any differently and has noticed they tend to be quite confident.One way female students in these male-dominated fields at UW find community and strength is through Women in Science and Engineering. WISE is a worldwide campaign that began in 1984.Frane is the vice president of the WISE out of house organization majoring in genetics. While genetics is a female-dominated field, Frane works closely with many female students who are in male-dominated fields.WISE gives girls the opportunity to find other women in their specific major, Frane said. Computer science, for example, is an undergraduate major with 230 women compared to 1085 men.“WISE helps make a smaller campus for everyone, even smaller for the women in STEM on campus,” Frane said. “It can be really hard, especially for those girls in engineering, to connect with other women on campus.”Houghtaling, also in WISE, agreed with Frane. The program holds seminars to connect students with women in STEM.“The future for women is bright.”
Timothy SmeedingThe program provides female role models for students in their specific fields as well as contacts for things like internships, Houghtaling said. Houghtaling made a contact at a seminar and was able to maintain a research position because of that connection.“I feel like I don’t know what I would do without WISE because there are so many people that think like you and are going into the same the same field as you,” Houghtaling said. “You just instantly have a bond.”In addition to the classroom, men dominate shop areas as well. To get women more involved with the hands-on processes of design and fabrication, biological system engineering professor Rebecca Larson and shop instrumentation specialist Kody Habeck started the Biological Systems Engineering Women’s Shop Night.Larson said it is sometimes difficult for women to be in a shop surrounded by males along with the added pressure of learning a new task.“I think the women who have participated have grown in many different ways,” Larson said. “Some are more confident in their abilities which is reflected in other parts of their work.” The female students who participate in the BSE women’s shop night are also able to meet and form relationships with women in their fields with similar interests, Larson said.While a lot of work still needs to be done to encourage women to go into STEM fields, one great step is providing young women with role models who encourage their passion in their fields, Larson said.“Sometimes it can be discouraging when I hear [women] are backsliding in some ways,” Larson said. “But programs like this and the female students I see in the department comfort me as I remember there are so many wonderful females who will absolutely continue to help the STEM fields evolved to be a more inclusive environment.”______Correction: A print version of this article said biomedical engineering is a major that is dominated by men. This article has been updated to reflect that that field currently has a near-equal split between men and women. The Badger Herald regrets this error.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2020/11/06/the-wig-lady-bringing-style-confidence-to-cancer-patients/,"Nov 6, 2020","Stephanie Schutz stands behind a salon chair, looking into the mirror. Looking back at her is today’s client — an elderly woman in the midst of cancer treatments.The client’s husband holds back tears as he looks at his wife. Her hair has fallen out due to the harsh radiation treatments — she had walked into the salon hoping for a new look.Schutz places the wig, which they carefully selected together, over the woman’s head.“I look just as I always looked,” the woman says, as she looks at herself in the mirror.The woman’s husband responds with a smile, recognizing that Schutz just provided his wife with a way to restore her image to that of a strong, cancer-free woman. In a sense, Schutz allowed her client’s outer image to represent her inner strength as she fought cancer.Schutz is neither a doctor nor a nurse, yet the work she does is essential to cancer patients. As a hairstylist in the Wig Salon located on the ground floor of the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, the Madison native helps her clients deal with a reality that almost every one of them has to go through — radiation and chemotherapy causing hair loss.Clients in the time of COVIDThe Wig Salon is a small, simple, two-room space. In the waiting room, a mannequin in a blue hairband stands on the windowsill, wearing a blue cotton scarf. Right beside it lies a black ornament engraved with bold white letters — “Be kind; Be positive; Be courageous.”It is the type of salon that Schutz had always dreamed about having for herself and her clients.The salon is tidy, with no loose hairs littering the floor. Instead, decorative paintings adorn the wall. One of them is a piece of scribble contributed by a five-year old. Schutz said she let the artist — one of her client’s children — draw when she was waiting for her mother to find the right wig.“Sometimes people bring their kids … that day, I got kids crayons [ready],” Schutz said.Schutz typically gives cancer patients two to three choices of wigs from which they can select their favorite. They end up receiving one free wig, styling services and wig maintenance products. But, unfortunately, COVID-19 health protocols in the cancer center have added an extra challenge to this process during the pandemic.Now, the whole fitting and styling process needs to be done on the mannequin, without touching scalps of cancer patients. These patients are immunocompromised due to their cancer treatments, and, therefore, more vulnerable to COVID-19, but this new process isn’t working as well as Schutz hoped.“It might be the right haircut, but not the right color. Then, that way [it] isn’t going home with the person,” Schutz said.The New England Journal of Medicine shows that coronavirus can last three days on plastic surfaces. Since wigs are made from synthetic hair and are 100% plastic-made, there are risks involved.Schutz is cautious about it as she has adjusted her normal approach to “keep everything COVID-19 safe.”“I’m now quarantining wigs,” Schutz said. “Once I try a wig on somebody, I really have to quarantine it for two weeks.”The journey from the salonSchutz, a Madison native, never thought she would end up working for cancer patients in a hospital. This is now her 17th year. Having worked in the cancer center long enough, Schutz sometimes is referred to as “the wig lady.”But despite her tenure at the cancer center, Schutz initially dreamed about doing something entirely different. When in cosmetology school, the young Schutz stood behind the chair for hours doing perms, hair colors or whatever else her clients and teachers asked for. She learned every trick of the trade and dreamed about owning her own  salon someday.“So my dream salon was very high fashion,” Schutz said.One Tomato at a Time: Local efforts work to reconnect Black growers with the land
Whenever Robert Pierce gets stressed or depressed, he goes outside and digs his hands into the soil that fills his Read…Even 30 years later, Schutz still remembers the details of her dream salon. It resides in a happy and friendly home-style setting with wooden tables and white walls in the living room and dining area. She even thought about details like trays, candles and lamps.Fresh out of cosmetology school, Schutz landed her first job as a hairdresser in a local salon right here in Madison. Within a year, an unexpected development derailed her dreams of establishing a name for herself in the industry.Every day, Schutz shampooed clients’ hair, applied hair dyes and cut and permed hair. Toward the end of her first year, in 1986, Schutz fell ill and had to stay home for eight days. She felt sick with persisting respiratory problems and had red, itchy spots all over her body. Schutz consulted a doctor who diagnosed her with contact dermatitis. It was caused primarily by her overexposure to chemicals such as hair bleaches, dyes and shampoos at her workplace.The doctor warned Schutz not to go back to the hair salon, or else the same symptoms would come back and develop more rapidly.“He told me I’m a broken fence,” Schutz said. “He said I can be repaired but I’ll never be the same [person].”Schutz was heartbroken — she could no longer pursue the career she had dreamed of and worked toward for years.After this, Schutz tried many different jobs in the hair care industry, working mainly as a sales representative and promoting hair care products. Sometimes, the job required her to travel around Southern Wisconsin and Chicago. Other times, she needed to provide on-site training.“But nothing really was exactly right,” Schutz recalled.She missed her work in the hair salon and missed how she could make her customers look better.Schutz didn’t expect she would begin to find her next passion in such an unlikely place. Though, Schutz said she may have had a prior inclination toward her current work.“There may have been the seed planted there that I didn’t really realize until later,” she said.In the early 1990s, Schutz’s grandmother was diagnosed with colon cancer. Schutz said her grandma was her inspiration for loving wigs and hair fashions, and Schutz used to follow her grandma to hair salons to see new hair styles. Eventually, Schutz watched as her grandma started to lose her hair and began wearing wigs.As her cancer spread, Schutz’s grandma went from the hospital to a nursing home. Since she was in her 90s, radical treatments provided little hope.“I went to see her and did her hair every day,” Schutz said. “It never seemed like enough time with her.”Schutz’s grandma eventually lost her battle with colon cancer. After this momentous loss, Schutz was left looking for a new path forward.Right around this time, Schutz married and became a mother, though in 1998, she got divorced and became the single mother to her two children.Schutz devoted herself to her children’s education, spending as much time with them as possible. She eventually worked for a Montessori school as an assistant teacher.Finding a new passionDespite occupying herself with her children, Schutz still missed her salon work and the unique skills she used to improve a client’s look.One day, while skimming through a magazine, Schutz came across an ad for the American Cancer Society and called them. The ACS, a nationwide voluntary health organization, helps operate the Look Good Feel Better program that aims to restore the physical appearance and self-image of cancer patients — women in particular — during their radiation and chemotherapy treatments.A Swing State: During COVID-19, UW student groups change tactics to get youth out to vote
Wisconsin is undoubtedly one of the most fervently contested states on the electoral map in 2020.  Both the Trump and Read…All licensed cosmetology volunteers must attend a four-hour certification class to be a program participant. Schutz signed up for the training in the ACS’s Madison office and became a voluntary program instructor in 1999, where she taught group participants wig trends, wig types and wig cares.“It just came to me, probably because I still really wanted to be a cosmetologist,” Schutz said. “I couldn’t be, but I was still trying to dabble in doing something.”Schutz felt for the young women she saw who were diagnosed with cancer and could not find age-appropriate wigs.“The whole cancer diagnosis has already made them feel really not good,” Schutz said. “[The wigs] made them feel even worse. I could feel their feelings.”Cancer diagnoses in younger demographics increased around the same time that Schutz began to volunteer, increasing the need for a wider range of wig selections. The Wisconsin Cancer Incidence and Mortality report for 2002-2006 published by the State Department of Health Services shows a steadily increasing number of cancer cases among women from 2002 to 2005, including a steady rise in numbers among women aged 30 to 45.“I just saw such a need, and I wanted to help so much,” Schutz said.Eventually, Schutz came up with the idea of opening a wig salon, making cancer patients look younger and stylish. Schutz ultimately decided to apply for a grant through the Small Business Development Center at UW.Beth Blum, a manager of UW Health, met with Schutz about her wig business idea. Schutz explained her vision to Blum, including wig styling and wig maintenance for cancer patients — and Blum instantly liked it. The institution has had a wig program for cancer patients since 1995, run primarily by volunteers. Yet, it didn’t have a physical and private space for wig fitting and cutting.“We felt like UW Health should offer the service to our patients,” Blum recalls. “We said, ‘well, why don’t we just hire her?’”Schutz took the offer and was hired as a part-time cosmetologist in 2013. Around the same time, UW Health remodeled the cancer clinic spaces and built up the Wig Salon. In the salon, Schutz orders wigs, trains a group of volunteers, trims and fits wigs and teaches wig maintenance.After years of search throughout the hair care industry, Schutz finally settled into her passion, even if it wasn’t what she originally had in mind. Now, Schutz has forged a different path to apply her skills to improve clients’ looks and embolden their confidence.“My care-giver personality, my love of fashion and hair, the volunteer work … it really has made me a perfect fit for working in the center,” Schutz said.Even with all the people she has helped, the job has not brought Schutz a lot of money. Schutz said she had thought about having some hair appointments at home at the beginning of the job, but quickly threw that idea — as well as her ambitious business plan — away.“I’m a starving artist.” Schutz said. “But it’s such a fantastic, rewarding position that I do feel is worth every dime.”Even if Schutz doesn’t make a lot of money, she has managed to make an impact on thousands of lives during her career.Schutz helps 400-500 patients a year and she says each patient is memorable.“I may not remember names, but I always, pretty much always remember faces,” Schutz said.Kristie Konsoer, a Middleton-based elementary school teacher diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 2012, remembers Schutz very well. Konsoer said Schutz is a “gem.”Konsoer said she went back to Schutz after her hair began to grow back out and she needed a cut. She felt warmth and connection with Schutz.“It’s really meaningful. It makes my heart happy,” Konsoer said. The Money Trail: A look at UW’s endowment during COVID-19 as financial issues abound

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2017/09/07/the-badger-herald-reacts-to-taylor-swifts-new-singles/,"Sep 7, 2017","I will admit that the pre-chorus to “Look What You Made Me Do” is somewhat catchy — or maybe it’s trash and just happens to be the catchiest part of this song. When the chorus hits I feel as though I’ve gone brain dead; or maybe it’s Taylor that’s gone brain dead if she thinks this music is worthy of being released.Taylor Swift genuinely believes that she’s some badass or a wolf dressed in sheep’s clothing. But when she sings “…the old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, because she’s dead,” she reminds me of nothing more than a 13 year old going through an emo phase.Most people were okay with Taylor’s transition from country to pop, but I question the sanity of people who continue to support her most recent transition. Her time is done, so let’s make room for the artists who can remain relevant without having to make people feel bad for them.Let’s be real here, most people’s issue with this song, and with the album in general, is not the actual content. Taylor Swift returned with 75 percent of the population hating her, and still made major waves, despite everyone rooting for her failure.I think that if you take away this hatred that everyone seems to be holding on to for way too long, and look at the song for what it is, you’ll realize that Taylor is just as sick of her old self as you are. Hence, why the old Taylor is dead and cannot come to the phone right now. I also love that Swift acknowledges her past hiccups, but shows that she is moving on from her mistakes in the nick of time, and we all should too.The song is catchy, and the music video is genius (who knew so many easter eggs could be in one video) and that final scene is just brilliant. Even her other track “…Ready For It?” is being used as the college football anthem this year. If that isn’t a comeback, then I don’t know what is.While the production quality of the “Look What You Made Me Do” video was incredible (though, I’d be more shocked if it wasn’t, considering the bathtub filled with jewels was worth about $10 million alone), there is little about both the song and video that I can compliment. As Swift attempted to redefine her image to be edgier (#TheOldTaylorIsDead), everything about the storyline of the song and video felt forced and “extra.” The Badger Herald reacts to Beyoncé’s ‘Lemonade’
Nothing gets a newsroom going quite like a new Beyoncé release. Here are our initial thoughts, musings, outbursts and epiphanies Read…Various props in the video, from the “I <3 TS,” shirt that her ex-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston famously wore, to the bathtub of jewels — which some believed referenced when Kim Kardashian was restrained and robbed of an estimated $5 million of jewelry while wearing a bathrobe–felt tacky and overboard. I will say this 500 times if I have to (though, I’m ashamed I must say it at all), you cannot write an empowering song while simultaneously taking a jab at violence against women, or inferring that a woman would make up this “perfect crime” for attention.Nothing about the video or song came across as empowering. Swift focused on tired celebrity ‘beefs’ and ex-boyfriends, using unspecific language and throwaway lyrics, above actually making a relatable message.If she had only focused more on her recent sexual assault case against David Mueller, instead of on celebrity feuds that she herself had agitated, perhaps the message of the song would have felt more powerful.After diving headlong back into 1989 this summer when Taylor’s catalog once again appeared on Spotify, my excitement for the new Taylor album rivaled that of drunk girls at the bar when “Work” comes on. Sadly, the first two singles indicate a decline in quality from Taylor’s prior work.Both songs have their moments, “Look What You Made Me Do” took only a few listens to get stuck in my head, I actually love the pre-chorus and I still believe in its ability to become a massive hit.While “…Ready For It?” has a chorus that echoes the best part of a Taylor Swift song, wistful longing that unfortunately inevitably leads to regrettable 3 a.m. texts.But the overall sound that Taylor has chosen to pursue in these two songs has significantly decreased my level of excitement for Reputation. These songs remind me of a bad Soundcloud rapper’s rip off of Yeezus.The lyrics of “Look What You Made Me Do” clearly target Mr. West, but Taylor has made the mistake of thinking the best way for her to win this fight lies in ripping off Kanye’s sound and doing it better than him. Unfortunately for Taylor, Kanye will always be better at being Kanye than anybody else.I haven’t listened to anything Tay has put out. I have dignity.Okay so this bitch tried to be Beyoncé in her music video. No one can be as flawless as Beyoncé so obviously it was a failed attempt.I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t torn about Taylor Swift. One part of me wants to lean towards supporting her — is it true that a male artist’s release of a revenge album would dub him a gifted genius rather than a calculating, maniacal bitch? Perhaps.However, is Taylor all of a sudden incredibly vocal after a year of staying quiet during a bonkers election — one in which a woman of Taylor’s stance and influence could have possibly made a difference? It is a little strange. After all this time, she breaks her silence with clips of a CGI snake and an intent focus on her death and resurrection — it’s all about Taylor Swift, and oh, look what you made her do.Here’s the thing though — if it was anyone else, I would have thought this secret revenge album shit was so badass. But a part of me can’t help but be irritated with Swift’s fixation on herself and her reputation when frankly, I don’t give a damn. Maybe I’m bitter with Swift for not using her overwhelming power as a successful female artist to make some much-needed change in this world, and it’s something I can’t look past. However, I will say: “Look What You Made Me Do” has grown on me. Like a parasite.

The violent crimes unit will focus on crimes involving weapons or personal injury such as homicide or armed robbery, while the burglary unit will focus on crimes such as home break-ins and robberies.“These [violent crimes] are very up close and personal and leave victims in their midst because they’ve been face-to-face with their assailant or the robber or murderer,” Koval said. “These are personal crimes of a higher order.”The burglary unit differs from the violent crime unit because the crime in these units involves property versus people, Koval said.Even with this key difference, the burglary crimes are far from insignificant, Koval said.“The Legislature has elevated [burglary crimes] to such a high stature … and we also believe [burglary] carries with it a psychological violation, that someone has been in your home without your consent going through your stuff,” Koval said.These new units will hopefully be beneficial to those who live in downtown Madison, such as students residing in student housing, Despain said. In the event of a pattern of violence crime or burglaries, the individual units can be deployed to more adequately deal with the situation.Moving forward, Koval said he is definitely interested in opening more specialized units if the current two perform well. Possibilities for new units could include focuses on issues such as domestic violence, sexual assault, juveniles and gang violence. Although Madison is not “off the charts” in terms of violent crimes and burglaries, Koval hopes these two new units will be able to bring violent trends down even lower.“At the end of the day, we want to be more responsive to those emerging or trending crimes as they’re occurring,” Koval said. “While crime in Madison is not off the charts, there are clearly more upticks in the areas of violent crimes and burglary crimes so we want to stay abreast of those trends and use our resources accordingly to defeat those before they become the new normal.”",Police Chief Koval introduces two new detective units to Madison,UWM

The suit seeks damages for injuries sustained after she was allegedly drugged and raped multiple times at the Sigma Chi house the night of Oct. 4 or in the early morning of Oct. 5, 2008.Filed in late March, the document says the woman is claiming $2,321.47 to pay for medical bills and $10 million to cover past and future physical and emotional injuries.The document also contains a list of witnesses who, unless a pending motion to dismiss the case is approved later this year, could be called to testify when trial proceedings begin in 2011. Witnesses include medical experts, UW students, members of Chancellor Biddy Martin‘s office, Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Association, and at least one member of Sigma Chi, among others.In support of potential testimonies by medical officials, other documents detail physical and emotional pain sustained by the plaintiff. Meriter Hospital records detail tests and treatments administered Oct. 5, including a sexual assault nurse exam.The records indicate serious damage was found during a pelvic exam and the student also sustained injuries to her right foot and face.Another document, submitted by psychologist Marc Ackerman, includes findings from a psychological examination completed in May 2009. In the document, Ackerman says the student had been suffering academically, socially and emotionally since the rape. Tests suggested she may have been suffering from major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and somatization disorder.However, the defendants are currently seeking to dismiss the case, with one motion filed March 15 stating the plaintiff’s failure to disclose an insurer or other party that paid for medical care limits the defendants’ abilities to collect information and creates other problems for the judicial process.However, the plaintiff could file an updated complaint to address these concerns, as was done in an amended complaint after the defendants filed a motion objecting to the plaintiff’s charge that the fraternity’s owners violated Wisconsin safe place statutes by not providing a safe space for guests.The plaintiff filed a second amended complaint in early March that makes another series of changes to the suit. The original complaint provides examples of a variety of incidents at other Sigma Chi chapters, including several instances of sexual assault.The latest complaint still names other chapters, but focuses more clearly on alleging the defendants should have specifically made a greater effort to protect female visitors from sexual abuse and other violations of chapter, city and state laws due to knowledge of past incidents at other chapter houses.It also adds it was previously known there were practices of alcohol abuse at Sigma Chi, putting guests at risk.As in the first two complaints, the defendants denied the plaintiff’s charges, demanding a dismissal of the second amended complaint.Both parties are also undergoing collection of information for the suit. Among the items plaintiff attorney Robert Elliott of Milwaukee wants the defendants to release is a document produced by Sigma Chi headquarters titled “The Ritual.” Elliott believes a potentially similar document he obtained via the Internet indicates the national headquarters exercise extreme control over individual chapters.The amount of control headquarters exerts over the UW chapter has emerged as a major issue in the suit, though headquarters has consistently denied any serious control of or responsibility for actions within individual houses.“However, even a cursory reading of ‘The Ritual’ demonstrates that the [national headquarters] exercises rigid control over its chapters…,” Elliott said in an affidavit filed March 10.Sigma Chi attorney Marie Stanton said the defendants will file a reply by Friday.American Family Mutual Insurance Company was dismissed as a defendant Monday after a Milwaukee judge agreed their insurance policies covering Sigma Chi do not apply to the suit. Milwaukee attorney James Murray said another defendant, Lloyd’s of London, would most likely cover the fraternity.The student and Elliott have previously stated they will not speak to the media concerning the suit.A scheduling order filed in December names Nov. 1 as the deadline for the completion of information collection, excluding out of court testimonies.A final pretrial conference will be held April 1, 2011, when a trial date, if required, will be scheduled.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2020/05/09/madisons-only-emergency-domestic-violence-shelter-handles-pandemic-related-surge-in-demand/,"May 9, 2020","Amid the public health crisis of COVID-19, another public health crisis has been exacerbated by stress and stay at home orders, experts report. A surge in domestic violence has affected countries across the world. In Madison, the police department has seen a 14% increase in the number of domestic violence-related calls.While institutions across the nation are in a state of upheaval, Madison’s Domestic Abuse Intervention Services is used to dealing with crises, said Executive Director of DAIS Shannon Barry.“We do crisis-based work all the time, and so in many ways, we are built for this. I think our team has been really stepping up,” said Barry. “Domestic violence batters will often, just in the best of times, work to isolate their victims from friends, family members and other support networks. Now everybody’s isolated, everybody’s staying at home, and so that has increased the potential danger for people.”In March, DAIS received a $58,000 grant in emergency shelter funding from Dane County, along with a grant from the Boys and Girls Club in order to meet the needs during the pandemic, according to reporting from the Wisconsin State Journal.When someone is arrested for a domestic violence related crime, the Madison Police Department automatically refers the victim to DAIS — the county’s only emergency domestic violence shelter.“We’ve actually seen an increase in the number of referrals that we’re getting from law enforcement,” said Barry. “And I suspect that the longer the order exists, the more potential we might see for domestic violence escalating.”COVID-19 Daily Updates: Over 5,000 confirmed cases in Wisconsin, at least 262 deaths
The Badger Herald will update this article daily as more COVID-19 information comes out.  Friday, April 24. Wisconsin now has Read…DAIS had 19% more referrals from law enforcement in March 2020 than in March 2019, what Barry calls a “significant” increase, not just a typical fluctuation.But the DAIS 24-hour helpline has not seen an increase in calls since the Safer at Home order began. Barry said this isn’t surprising, because people often call while trying to determine the next steps in their safety plan — but now, victims feel trapped at home.“They’re not trying to reach out to DAIS because their batters are monitoring them, and so they may not be able to reach out to us earlier to do that planning. But then things escalate to the point where they need law enforcement involvement,” Barry said.Barry said she predicts when the Safer at Home orders are lifted, DAIS will see a huge increase in calls to their helpline.Barry said this is because they’ll have more privacy to call.“If [victims] can go back to work or their abuser can go back to work, they’ll have more privacy to give us a call,” Barry said.DAIS is preparing for that and will be ready whenever that influx happens, Barry said. They have already deployed several staff members from other areas of the organization to help cover the helpline and crisis intervention work they are expecting.Another contributor to the surge of domestic violence may be financial stress.“We know that when families are experiencing financial stress, domestic violence rates go up,” said Barry.Madison city council signs resolution declaring racism to be public health crisis
On October 15, the Madison’s city council signed on to the Wisconsin Public Health Association’s 2018 resolution declaring racism to Read…During the last economic recession between 2008 and 2009, DAIS experienced a 108% increase in the number of calls to their helpline of people seeking shelter services.The International Monetary Fund warned that the world is facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression, projecting the global economy would contract by three percent in 2020. Early this year before the pandemic, they predicted the world economy would outpace 2019 and grow by 3.3%. This year’s fall in output would be far worse than the last recession, when the world economy contracted by less than 1% between 2008 and 2009, as reported by the New York Times.“And then you have the addition of the stay at home orders and just general fear of dealing with such a scary virus and such a scary pandemic,” said Barry. “I think it’s going be a long haul for folks.”DAIS had been gearing up for the impact of the pandemic since February, when they began transferring their 24-hour helpline to be answered remotely and excused volunteers to minimize traffic through the building. They still offer all essential services, including their 24-hour helpline, legal advocacy services, case management and emergency shelter. The only thing DAIS has had to put on hold is their support groups, which they are working to organize virtually now that the Safer at Home order has been extended.Their legal advocacy program is still conducting in-person appointments, even though courthouses have been closed, however, people who need immediate services like a restraining order can enlist the help of DAIS.“People who don’t have their own computers or smartphones often use libraries to do things like that, but with all the libraries closed down, that’s not an option,” said Barry.To maximize social distancing for those staying at DAIS, they spread families out throughout the building, eat meals in shifts and use a sign-up sheet to use common spaces like the TV. Barry is also grateful that generous donors have given them masks for staff and family to wear.For those who are experiencing domestic violence during the pandemic, Barry said it is always best to enlist the help of an advocate. For many, calling can be a safety hazard. If that is an unsafe option, victims should get the help of a trusted friend or family member.Shattering the Silence: Student organizations pave way for sexual violence prevention, survivor support on campus

The following is an audio story that highlights individuals on campus who are part Read…“For example, maybe somebody sets up a friend who they trust that if they text them a code word, that friend then knows they need assistance,” said Barry. “Or tell a neighbor if you see this light go on in this window, please call for help.”Victims can also email DAIS at crisisline@abuseintervention.org if they feel unsafe calling them. Barry also recommends the National Domestic Violence Hotline that can be reached just by texting “LOVEIS” to the number 22522. This will connect victims with an advocate who can help them go through safety planning over text.“I think that this pandemic is demonstrating just how caring this community is in the ways in which people take care of each other. I think even staying at home is taking care of each other right now,” Barry said. “I hope that everyone will continue to have the resilience to keep it going, because that’s the only way we’re going to beat this, is if we continue to socially isolate. It’s really difficult right now, but I think in the long term, it’s going to keep us all safer and healthier.”",Madison’s only emergency domestic violence shelter handles pandemic-related surge in demand,UWM

https://badgerherald.com/features/2020/12/08/a-fight-for-liberation-blm-continues-the-movement/,"Dec 8, 2020","This summer, the Black Lives Matter movement gained the nation’s attention after the tragic murder of George Floyd was captured on camera. Millions turned out for protests in the U.S. and across the globe, despite risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.BLM is an organization created in 2013, with a global network spanning the U.S., Canada and the UK. The phrase ‘Black Lives Matter’ has become the title for the modern Black liberation movement.This summer, after Floyd’s murder, communities nationwide expressed a renewed focus on police brutality and emerging movements to defund law enforcement institutions and implement criminal justice reforms.Protests and riots prompted businesses across the country to board up their windows — including many in Madison — and artists in town used these boards to advocate for Black lives, which included phrases like “our existence is resistance.”Those boards represented the wider issues at hand — in Wisconsin, a state with massive racial achievement and economic gaps in just about every measure, these topics hit close to home. And when statewide Black representation in local government and higher education is limited, how exactly can the disenfranchised regain that lost ground?Liberty and justice for allThe Pledge of Allegiance — recited in our schools, our sports and throughout our lives — ends with the familiar phrase “liberty and justice for all.” But state Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee), said the authors of the Constitution didn’t include her. As a Black woman, Taylor wouldn’t even have been afforded the right to vote for another two centuries.Taylor said while Black women proudly marched alongside other women when advocating for the right to vote, today, racial disparities still exist within voting that cause people of color to have lower overall turnout.And that’s the antithesis to what principles the U.S. was supposed to be founded on.“[Justice] means fair and just,” Taylor said. “Liberty and justice for all means for everybody, not some of us, it’s not dependent on something special — who you know, what you know.”Taylor said while the American dream looks the same for many people, some groups have better access to it than others. In her own city of Milwaukee, Black people make up about 39% of the population, but only own about 7% of homes.Freedom Inc.’s Youth Justice Director Bianca Gomez said liberty and justice for all means access to housing, resources, quality food, healthcare and restorative justice programs that hold others accountable.For many advocates, equality for Black lives is a social justice issue, not inherently a political one. But this summer revealed a deeply entrenched divide between liberals and conservatives regarding support for the BLM movement.UW Professor Emerita of Sociology, Pamela Oliver, wrote in an essay that protests can be polarizing, forcing people to choose sides. Case in action — this year, liberals and conservatives hotly debated the effectiveness and goals of protests and riots nationwide.Many local businesses across the U.S. were damaged and while many on both sides of the aisle said they don’t condone violence, liberals and conservatives disagreed on why people were protesting.Gomez said it’s far more complex than partisanship.“Liberals and conservatives and Democrats and Republicans; I think all of those things are anti-Black,” Gomez said. “All of those things will not do anything in favor of Black people unless they are pushed to do it.”That push can take the form of pressure on officials, direct action, demonstrations and policy recommendations, Gomez said.And some constituents are trying to do exactly that. This year, many emailed the Dane County Board of Supervisors, asking them to stop the construction of the new county jail and instead urged supervisors to invest in alternatives to incarceration.In July, the Dane County Board of Supervisors declared racism a public health crisis. The Board rejected a proposal to defund the Dane County Sheriff’s Office and passed a motion to add funding for a mental health ambulance as an alternative to law enforcement intervention during the 2021 budget deliberation process in Nov.Part of the defunding project included suspending the use of chemical munitions until Jan. 2021, when a study by the City of Madison Police Department on the use of tear gas would be completed. This amendment failed with an 18–18 vote.Oliver said the BLM movement found success in adding policy reform to political agendas and persuading reform. Oliver noted that movements almost never achieve all of their goals — and sometimes, a countermovement takes away the goals they achieve.In another essay, Oliver said protests can be a tool for the disempowered, call attention to grievance and create pressure for policy change. She added that many protests produced large-scale social change in the past.“That a group is protesting at all is usually a sign that it is in a weak or at least defensive position,” Oliver said. “People who already have power and privilege usually don’t protest because they don’t need to protest to get what they want.”Collectively, Black elected officials don’t hold a sizable margin in the state legislature. The Wisconsin Legislative Black Caucus is composed of seven members — Taylor, Sen. LaTonya Johnson, Rep. LaKeshia Myers, Rep. Kalan Haywood, Rep. David Bowen, Rep. Jason Fields — who all represent Milwaukee districts — and Rep. Shelia Stubbs (D-Madison), who doubles as a Dane County Supervisor.Gomez said lack of representation forces individual Black government officials to try to shoulder mass change on their infrequently appearing shoulders — and it’s difficult to create change that way.“One Black elected official can’t do it on their own,” Gomez said. “Individual leaders and actors are not the solution to our problems. Collective decision making, collective power and collective healing are the solution to our problems. Not one president or another, or one political party or another.”Being an allyGomez said people need to be taught to use their voice within education in order for communities to have a seat at the table and gain decision-making power.In her fight to make this happen, Gomez works with young Black girls in Freedom Inc.’s Black Girls Matter program, teaching them how to fight against white supremacy while giving them a space to receive support and be themselves.As a UW alum, Gomez said the university needs to put students over profit.“The students who are most impacted [need] not just a seat at the table but decision making power over what keeps them safe,” Gomez said.Gomez said UW tokenizes Black students by putting a few Black students on websites and letting those students give speeches and attend meetings. And she doesn’t think giving only a few students a seat at the table is enough.So for those trying to get involved, there are different ways to show up, Gomez said, acknowledging that not everyone can march. This may include donating food and supplies, talking to friends and family, driving cars to protect protestors and utilizing social media.“All of those things create a movement,” Gomez said. “The uprisings, demonstrations, rebellions, speeches, Facebook posts, donations, food trucks, housing … It’s not just one or the other, but it’s a combination of all those things. It’s okay that somebody can’t show up to a protest. I do think that people should reflect on why they can’t show up to protest or action.”Many turned to social media this summer to share information on local protests and resources to demonstrate support. On Instagram, accounts such as #DiversifyOurNarrative and soyouwanttotalkabout created shareable graphics outlining resources and explaining concepts, such as how to start conversations with friends and family about defunding the police.UW’s Associate Vice Chancellor for Identity and Inclusion, Gabe Javier, said people need to stay vigilant and informed, engage in consistent conversations with friends and family and continue to pay attention to racial injustice.Javier said being an ally includes listening to students of color and their needs.“Listen to students of color, listen to what their needs are, understand your own positional power and spheres of influence and where you’re able to affect change and then work on learning about your relationship to power,” Javier said. “Don’t put the burden on your friends of color, or disabled friends or queer friends to educate you.”Many UW students showed up for the fight this summer. Current and former students petitioned to change the UW crest from white to black on student-athlete uniforms to represent the underrepresented students on campus. UW sophomore Djamal Lylecryus created the rising Instagram page BIPOCatwisco, where BIPOC students can share their experiences in hopes of engaging students with racial justice issues on campus.Javier said people must continue to engage in conversations and we can’t afford to get comfortable.“We all personally, and as an institution, have room to grow,” Javier said. “When we talk about racism and anti-Black racism, it’s never finished … It’s constantly people in their own spheres of influence understanding how to affect change … We have to recognize everything we build and then push to build more.”UW’s Our Wisconsin is an inclusion education program with the goal of raising awareness and creating an environment where students are free to express their identities and experiences. The program is now mandatory for all incoming students, Javier said.The learning goals of the program include awareness of diversity on campus and appreciation for how individual actions and systems impact an individual’s experience. The program also includes how to engage in constructive dialogue about diversity and inclusion and gain a greater sense of connection with the campus communityLaw enforcement and criminal justice reformAfter the country watched Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin take the life of Floyd, people across the nation began to question the integrity of law enforcement agencies. Practices used by police — especially the use of force — and hours of law enforcement training received a lot of attention.The Associated Students of Madison, UW’s student government, shared the nation’s distrust of law enforcement and passed a vote of no-confidence in the UW Police Department.“This vote signifies a lack of confidence and trust in the UWPD due to their presence at the protests off campus, failure to comply with the #8CantWait standards, and unwillingness to meet all or most of the reforms requested by ASM leaders and students,” ASM wrote in a press release.According to the release, The UW BIPOC Coalition, the Teaching Assistants’ Association, the United Faculty and Academic Staff and University Labor Council supported the decision.UWPD Chief Kristen Roman wrote in a statement she was “disappointed” UWPD was not given the opportunity to engage in the process.“A vote that cuts to the chase and bypasses any opportunity to engage — to share information, to listen, to learn, to clarify, to contextualize — undermines trust-building,” Roman said in the statement.UWPD plans to implement a Racial Equity Initiative within the next academic year. UWPD already closely aligns with the demands of the #8CantWait Campaign, but states “we recognize and embrace the need to push further.” The influx of concern and questions prompted UWPD to create a webpage describing the ways in which the department aligns with the movement.The #8CantWait campaign uses absolute language, such as banning use of force in all situations. UWPD, however, bans uses of force except when no other alternative is available to neutralize a situation.UWPD’s Executive Director for Recruitment, Diversity and Inclusion Louis Macias said the goals of these demands are removing officer discretion by outlining how police behave in situations. But Macias said this isn’t realistic.“There needs to be some level of discretion that we give to police officers to do the right thing,” Macias said. “As someone that does diversity and inclusion work, as a person of color … I feel like bringing police closer is more the answer than to keep them separate from me and understanding me and knowing my values and who I am.”Roman worked for the Madison Police Department for 27 years and has now worked at UWPD for three years. Roman noticed differences in the needs of both departments and said the absolutist language of the #8CantWait campaign doesn’t reflect those differences.Roman acknowledged this is a gray area, but said community partnerships, relationships and collaboration exist here.“These policies and these demands boil down to trust and the absolutes are an effort to remove any of that gray, and gray requires trust, but effective community policing requires that we have that gray and that’s where community partnerships and collaborations become essential, that’s where we work it all out,” Roman said.She added demands that are all or nothing can create unintended consequences and she doesn’t believe discussions around the middle ground should be viewed as inherently defensive or resistant to change.Policy alone, no matter how obsolete, isn’t the answer, Roman said.“At the end of the day, it’s the philosophy, the training, the approach, the expectation, the culture of the organization, the relationship with the community,” Romain said. “All of those layers are going to factor into what an officer does.”She noted UWPD weaves de-escalation into all training exercises, which means de-escalation training hours aren’t distinctly stated in UWPD reports.UWPD recently came under fire for spending about $6,500 on certain items — like pepper spray — in the early summer during protests. Roman said this spending doesn’t differ very much from previous years because the department spent most of the money on new equipment, such as replacing old guns, though UWPD did buy items like pepper spray as a precautionary measure to prepare for the protests.UWPD did not use tear gas or a less-lethal impact weapon, like foam bullets, during the protests and Macias said the use of pepper spray is not commentary on how UWPD feels about racial justice. UWPD wrote on Twitter officers deployed pepper spray when explosives or objects, such as bricks or bottles, were thrown at officers.Many social media users came out against the use of tear gas and pepper spray, however, and some claimed to be pepper-sprayed even when demonstrating non-violent behavior at Madison protests.When it comes to showing support for police, counter-protesters changed the familiar “Black Lives Matter” chant to “Blue Lives Matter” in a movement gaining traction across the nation. These counter-protesters called cops committing violent acts “bad apples” in an attempt to protect the reputation of the police.“The Blue Lives Matter and the bad apple argument, to the extent those things are leveraged to undermine and try to cancel out the notion that racial injustice exists within policing is absolutely wrong,” Macias said.In the fall, UWPD posted a photo on Twitter and the ‘thin blue line’ flag can be seen in the background. The flag is characterized by a blue line on a black and white American flag and Blue Lives Matter advocates have used the flag in their movement in recent years.The flag increasingly became associated with white supremacist ideals, though many argue its original meaning was not rooted in racism.It’s a complex issue and Macias said others should lean into the complexity. Neither pro- nor anti-police advocates will be able to find a solution to racial injustice without working together and finding common ground, he said.Roman encourages community members to assess the services UWPD provides and engage in discussions with UWPD about changes they seek.“People are the police and police are the people,” Roman said. “If we’re grounded in that, and in the humanity of it and in the core values that we’ve laid out in our reaching higher, then I don’t think it’s possible to go wrong if that’s what we’re living every day.”",A fight for liberation: BLM continues the movement,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2018/10/23/crimmigration-the-intermingling-criminal-justice-and-immigration-systems-disproportionately-affect-southeast-asians/,"Oct 23, 2018","April 14 marked the first day of the 2018 Khmer New Year. 67-year-old Sophal Chuk was grocery-shopping at Viet Hoa Market in Monona that morning in preparation for the big day.At home, Chuk’s wife waited for her husband’s return. But instead of welcoming a familiar face, she found herself answering questions from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials searching for her husband.“ICE came knocking at our door, and my mom didn’t know who it was,” Molly Bennett, Chuk’s daughter, recalled. “She was like, ‘Oh, he’s at the store’ — how did they know which store he was at?”ICE tracked down Chuk and brought him to the Dodge County detention center, but he was “bounced around” from one place to another, Bennett said. The family did not get to see Chuk that day.When Bennett and her family were finally able to see Chuk, he looked pale and had already suffered a minor stroke from stress. His family was worried about his physical and mental health.“My mom was crying and crying, because she felt like this was happening all over again,” Bennett added. “When he got detained the last time … all he did was try to renew his green card, and they just locked him up.”Chuk fled Cambodia for the U.S. and was lawfully admitted in 1985, ICE said. But a judge issued a final order of removal — a deportation notice — in 2004, 15 years after he was criminally convicted in Illinois and served time in prison.Bennett said her father never got in trouble again, not even so much as a speeding ticket. Instead, he has volunteered at Freedom Inc., a Madison-based non-profit that serves low- to no-income communities of color. She questioned the timing of his detentions.“Why now? Why all of a sudden now?” Bennett asked. “He served his time — that’s it. We follow the laws and the rules here. He was convicted and he served it — done. Let us be free now. Let us live our life.”Chuk is not alone in this struggle, however. In September, the 4-day ICE operation in Wisconsin accounted for 83 detainees — 20 from Dane County — more than half of whom have criminal histories. One Thai man with a criminal conviction and one Vietnamese individual were taken.Katrina Dizon Mariategue, director of national policy at the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the immigration and criminal justice systems have become more intersected in recent years as a result of legislative actions from the past two decades.But this phenomenon disproportionately affects Southeast Asian immigrants. Today, they are three to five times more likely to be deported based on old criminal convictions than other immigrant groups.This “resettlement–school–prison–deportation pipeline,” as Dizon Mariategue calls it, refers to the idea that these legislative actions neglect that Southeast Asian immigrants — most of whom came to the U.S. in the aftermath of American involvement in their home countries and have obtained legal documentation — face a resettlement process that’s fraught with poverty, racism and institutional barriers.For example, Wisconsin, home to the country’s third largest Hmong population, has an average poverty rate of 8 percent; but the number increases to 19 percent when considering only Hmong Wisconsinites. Kabzuag Vaj, co–executive director of Freedom Inc., said the Cambodian community in Madison also faces disproportionate levels of poverty.“The reality is [that some of them] have committed crimes — but again, people don’t understand the circumstances and their history of resettlement,” Dizon Mariategue said. “What we’re advocating for is looking at the individual case’s circumstance before making a deportation determination.”As ICE conducts enforcement surge in Wisconsin, Madison officials condemn their actions
An increase in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity the last week has sparked a variety of responses from the Read…The year was 1975. The last U.S. troops retreated from Southeast Asia after nearly 20 years of involvement. Between those years, the U.S. devastated the region with more bombs than they used in Europe and Asia combined during World War II — at least 10 million tons in total in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.But the end of the Vietnam War and the secret bombings in Laos and Cambodia only jump-started another saga for the region: The unrest of the war had strengthened the communist Khmer Rouge insurgency. The same year, the communist faction would emerge victorious in the Cambodian Civil War, setting the stage for a campaign of calculated brutality.The genocidal Khmer Rouge ordered civilians to evacuate the city the very afternoon they seized Phnom Penh, the country’s capital. Intellectuals, professionals and minorities were murdered. Families were separated, and the entire population was categorized by age groups, each of which were forced to work “from dusk till dawn,” Savang Chhrom, Khmer gender justice coordinator at Freedom Inc., recalled. Chhrom also fled Cambodia as a child.This was the reality confronting Chuk until Khmer Rouge’s defeat in 1979, Bennett said. In its aftermath, Cambodians searched anxiously for their families, and many were on the verge of starving to death.Like many other civilians whose homes were destroyed during the wars, Chuk, at 34 years old, fled Cambodia for a resettlement camp in Thailand. In 1985, he was lawfully admitted into the United States and was placed in a housing project that accomodated “very low-income” individuals, Bennett said. He did not know anyone in the U.S. except for some friends he had made along the way. He did not have a support system.“Our community holds a lot of weight on our shoulders in terms of trauma, and I feel like that’s forgotten because Asians in general are usually clumped into a big group, and that’s normally seen as East Asians. But Southeast Asians — they come from really traumatic, tragic experiences that aren’t recognized.”
Solinna ChongAnna Oltman, a UW doctoral student whose dissertation examines the international politics of refugee protection and who worked at a refugee agency, suggested this lack of a sustainable support system is commonplace. She said although the federal government allocates funding — around $1,000 per person — to agencies supporting refugees, they are often left to fight their own battles just a year after arriving.“During that time it was like another struggle — you basically start all over again. You’re in a place where you don’t know the language and the culture, and you basically live in poverty,” Chhorm said. “A lot of gangs started because it was a form of protecting themselves. So a lot of people got into trouble because they know that the system does not protect them.”‘We might not have a voice tomorrow’: Students, activist groups protest ‘zero tolerance’ immigration policy
Demonstrators marched from Library Mall to Capitol Square Saturday afternoon to protest the detention of undocumented immigrant families in the Read…This “system” underscores various intertwining, “long-term negative” consequences for immigrants, Yang Sao Xiong, UW social work and Asian American studies professor, said.For example, he said many Southeast Asian immigrants are kept in low-income neighborhoods — such as the project Chuk was in — that have few stable and high-income jobs, which in turn perpetuates their poverty. These areas also receive greater societal and police surveillance, he said, leading to more frequent arrests.As a result, Cambodian and Laotian youth are incarcerated at respectively four and nine times the rate compared to the national average.Chuk himself also fell into the criminal justice system. In 1989, just four years after he first stepped foot in the country, Chuk was convicted in Illinois for sexual assault of a minor and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.But the trial, Bennett described, rendered his father defenseless: He did not speak any English, nor did he have a translation service, resources or help for his situation.“If you’re accused of something you should have someone to speak on your behalf. But he had the accuser speaking on his behalf, all he could do was shake his head — ‘okay’ — because he had no idea what they were saying,” Bennett said. “That’s all he could do. He didn’t want to get deported.”It was perhaps not just the lack of resources that affected Chuk, though.UW sociology professor Michael Light found in his 2017 study that noncitizens are “far more likely” to be incarcerated even after accounting for criminal history and offense severity. The lack of citizenship is as — if not more — salient a factor in determining punishment as race and ethnicity. The discrepancy, he said, is partially tied to the idea of resentment.“I have had a U.S. judge tell me, ‘Why are you screwing a country that has taken you in? It actually pisses me off,’” Light said. “We can see it also in political rhetoric. If there’s a homicide that occurs that involves an immigrant, that is oftentimes construed somehow as an indictment on immigration itself … But we don’t see that very often if it’s a homicide that involves no immigrants — usually it’s a problem with that person.”Still, this is only another facet of the challenge confronting Chuk.Even after serving his 10-year sentence more than three decades ago, Chuk will, for the third time, face the risk of deportation when his “stay,” a legal request that temporarily postpones the deportation process, reopens next year.His circumstances make a case for a brewing debate about the intermingling criminal justice and immigration systems: Whether rights like due process and protection from double jeopardy are afforded to immigrants facing deportation.Like Dizon Mariategue, Jenny Zhao, staff attorney at Asian Americans Advancing Justice – Asian Law Caucus, suggested the origin of this debate can be traced back to the 1990s, when the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act were passed under the Clinton administration.Executive order to end DACA leaves UW ‘dreamers’ living in limbo
She remembers it in patches — scratches on her legs from the thorn bushes, a stranger carrying her on his Read…Indeed, deportation in the Southeast Asian community soared after Congress passed AEDPA and IIRIRA in 1996. Dizon Mariategue said these laws retroactively expanded the definition of “aggravated felony” to include crimes that are sometimes neither “aggravated” nor “felonies” under state criminal laws.As a result, many immigrants with criminal history are now subjected to the consequences of aggravated felony under today’s definition, even if their convictions predated this redefinition and even if they have already served their sentences.In one instance, she said, an immigrant is facing deportation for having broken some windows.“It doesn’t matter your individual circumstances, it doesn’t matter if you’ve already served your time, it doesn’t matter if you’re a completely different person, [or if] you committed your crime decades ago,” Dizon Mariategue said. “According to this law, you have to be deported.”Zhao concurred, saying these laws neglect to consider the unique circumstances leading up to an immigrant’s conviction, which in turn prevent judges from granting immigrants pardon from deportation. As a result, she said, immigrants often do not have meaningful hearings and are summarily ordered deported after “very, very short” hearings with judges. “[But] there is no one right way to be an immigrant, and just because they didn’t commit a crime, or just because they are undocumented versus having a green card, that doesn’t make them more or less deserving to be living in this country.”
Katrina Dizon MariategueShe added many immigrants with past criminal convictions are being punished multiple times: Not only were they first punished in the criminal justice system, they often spend quite a bit of time in “immigration jail” because the same laws prohibit detainees from being released while their cases are pending. And the final stage of this three-part punishment: deportation.“I think what makes matters even worse is because their countries wouldn’t take them back. People were allowed to continue living in the U.S., and of course they built up expectations during that time,” Zhao said. “So now it feels like they’re being punished for a third time yet again … They’re just kind of torn from their lives.”It is not uncommon for Southeast Asian countries to deny deportees entry. Dizon Mariategue said because the U.S. was at war with many of them just a few decades ago, they did not accept deportees back until the U.S. began creating repatriation agreements after the ratification of the 1996 laws.But the Trump administration, she said, has initiated a series of “aggressive bullying” of foreign nations who have either refused to take deportees back or have been slow in doing so.For example, she observed that some immigrants were deported back to Vietnam last year although they had arrived in the U.S. before 1995 — an agreement between the U.S. and Vietnam stated that the latter would not accept pre-1995 refugees. The administration also issued a visa sanction on Cambodia last year to pressure the government to more quickly issue travel documents for deportees.As a result, more Cambodian and Vietnamese immigrants are deported. Whereas 35 Vietnamese were deported in 2016, the number rose to 71 in 2017. Dizon Mariategue estimated that 72 Cambodians have already been deported this year, and she projected the number will increase by the end of the year.Today, at least 16,000 Southeast Asians have received final orders of deportation. This means that, while only a fraction of them will be deported, some are detained in immigration jails, and others are on “stay” like Chuk.ICE enforcement surge sheds light on vulnerability of undocumented students
Growing up, undocumented Edgewood College student Lupe Salmeron remembers how her family would cover up the living room window of Read…But besides the deportation process itself, the consequences of it are yet another challenge deportees are forced to surmount.For example, when Vaj visited Cambodia and talked to U.S. deportees in 2016, she found the Cambodian government provides no support or social welfare for them — in part because they did not want to accept anyone not returning voluntarily.Southeast Asian countries often do not recognize deportees as citizens because many of them had come to the U.S. as babies and children, sometimes even born here.Because of that, Dizon Mariategue said, they are stuck in “limbo” —  accepted by neither country, stateless.“They get there … and they are just dropped off at the airport with no documentation,” Vaj said. “So to get documentation they basically have to lie about where they were born … or buy documentation off somebody else.”As a result, many deportees struggle with securing employment and housing.This also concerns Bennett. She fears that if Chuk were deported, he “wouldn’t make it there anyway.”Resolving issues faced by Southeast Asian immigrants will require the cooperation of many entities — locally, federally and internationally.Fabiola Hamdan, Dane County’s immigration affairs officer and an immigrant herself, said it was important for her role and for other immigrants that the Madison Police Department and the Dane County executive held a press conference in support of immigrants.Mayor Paul Soglin and the Madison Common Council also condemned ICE’s actions as “racist and xenophobic,” which have “terrorized and traumatized” families and children.But many who are fighting for the rights of Southeast Asians in Madison say there isn’t adequate support from the local government and the Madison community in light of recent news.Journalist, author discusses life as journalist advocating for immigrants

Vaj said she considers Journey’s decision “a distrust and retriggering of the refugee experience.”But the city council recently approved $40,000 to assist Kajsiab House until the end of the year, and Soglin has proposed $100,000 in transitional funding for the program in his 2019 budget. If the budget is denied, however, Kajsiab House will face the risk of termination.In light of such a risk, Vaj said she and some other community members have decided to establish a new non-profit, the Southeast Asian Healing Center, to continue the services of Kajsiab House and the Cambodian Temple.She said culturally-specific services are particularly instrumental for preventing community members with mental health concerns from feeling “othered.” Instead, it makes them feel like they’re “a part of surviving together,” she said.Solinna Chong, a member of Kajsiab House’s emergency budget team and a UW graduate student in social work, said these services also eliminate “power dynamics” that exist in non–culturally-specific services.“When you go to just your everyday provider — usually these providers are white, too — they’re not looking for [trauma caused by the history of resettlement] … So they might skip over that and come down with a misdiagnosis,” Chong said. “When your clinician doesn’t understand that, that could also be very retraumatizing.”But, these services are not only important to Southeast Asian communities in terms of recovering from the traumas of resettlement. They are also important for breaking the vicious cycle — the “resettlement–school–prison–deportation pipeline.”Citing a psychotraumatology study, Patti Coffey, UW psychology professor, said unaddressed trauma — especially those triggered by poverty and witnessing violence — are linked to offending behavior, therefore “likely” incarceration.As for breaking the cycle by combating poverty, Xiong said achieving higher education remains one of the few possible paths to economic mobility for Southeast Asian communities. Albeit, he said, schools that enforce elaborate filtering and gate-keeping practices often make achieving higher education difficult for them.Vaj also pointed out schools have “failed” young Southeast Asians in Madison, as evidenced by their low graduation rates and the achievement gap. But until schools desegregate data between the achievements of East and Southeast Asian students, Vaj said, these issues cannot be adequately addressed.But Xiong said some institutions — for example, the education and legal justice systems — are “taking an extremely long time to change just a little.”In light of the southern U.S. border crisis, immigration has emerged as the top issue in the upcoming midterm election for voters on either end of the political spectrum.But Dizon Mariategue said public discourse on the topic often neglects the ways in which immigration also affects the Southeast Asian community.She said although the issue of family separation at the border has rightly garnered a lot of media attention in the past year, people “don’t seem to be up in arms about that” when it comes to Southeast Asians, who have dealt with it for the past two decades.She said this is in part because a smaller number of Southeast Asians are affected by deportation compared to the Latinx community, but also because of the current political rhetoric about immigration.“For Congressional leaders who are Democrats, they … push this narrative around immigrants wanting to live the American Dream … that they’re model citizens. But for a lot of Southeast Asians, they don’t always fit this specific, perfect mold,” Dizon Mariategue said.“[But] there is no one right way to be an immigrant, and just because they didn’t commit a crime, or just because they are undocumented versus having a green card, that doesn’t make them more or less deserving to be living in this country.”Chong, too, said Southeast Asians are often left out of the conversation because of the persisting image of what an immigrant looks like.She attributed this in part to the “model minority myth” — the stereotype of Asian success and excellence that in effect neglects the struggles confronting the diverse community.“Our community holds a lot of weight on our shoulders in terms of trauma, and I feel like that’s forgotten because Asians in general are usually clumped into a big group, and that’s normally seen as East Asians,” Chong said. “But Southeast Asians — they come from really traumatic, tragic experiences that aren’t recognized.”Between 2004 and 2014, the U.S. has accepted and resettled more than 75,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar as a result of the country’s mass persecution against the minority.Precedent suggests another 75,000 Southeast Asians may be subjected to social inequities, unaddressed trauma from resettlement, and subsequently the flaws of the current criminal justice and immigration systems.But the fates of these refugees will lie largely in the hands of American voters and legislators — many of whom struggle to understand that escaping trauma and devastation from an ocean away sometimes leads only to another one-way ticket back.",‘Crimmigration’: How the intermingling criminal justice and immigration systems disproportionately affect Southeast Asians,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2018/12/04/right-of-way-inaccessible-public-transportation-limits-employment-affordable-housing-options-for-madisons-outskirts/,"Dec 4, 2018","“The bus is late,” said the man at the bus station at the intersection of East Washington Avenue and Thierer Road. He said the words cooly, as if the six had a reputation for running behind.He pointed to the time chart on the inside of the hut. “It was supposed to come at 1:58,” he smiled and gestured down the road. “When it’s coming, we should see it turn off of Independence Lane.”It was probably the panicked look in my eyes that told him to reassure me, that no, I wasn’t going to miss the bus. Or maybe it was the game of human frogger he saw me play across the four lanes of East Washington. Either way, he was right. The bus took a right off of Independence Lane and shortly came to our rescue.The next one was 20 minutes out, which would’ve made me late for an interview.Had I missed it, I had the option to take an Uber, providing expediency for a cost. I have options in how I travel.But the same luxury isn’t afforded to everyone.The low-income communities in Madison are one such group. Eric Sundquist, director of State Smart Transportation Initiatives, said these communities are being pushed to the outskirts of the city.Though housing is more affordable there, this suburbanization of poverty breeds unequal access to transportation and in turn, inefficiency and unequal access to schools, jobs and health options, Jessie Lerner, who oversees development and partnership at Sustain Dane, said.But this disproportionately affects marginalized communities.Citywide, 11.5 percent of people have to travel for longer than 45 minutes, according to the Madison Department of Transportation. For black people, that number rises to 26.7 percent, and to 19.6 percent for low-income people.For white people, that number is only 9.7 percent.When low-income individuals are pushed to the outskirts of the community, they have limited access to jobs because there isn’t a quick, efficient transportation system in place, David Trowbridge, transportation and policy planning manager for the city, said.“Transportation affects every single person every day,” Lerner said. “Having a multimodal transportation system, where we’re not relying on a vehicle, is what helps level the playing field and gives people access and choices to whatever their needs are.”While adequate transportation can mitigate social inequities, it’s also the leading contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, a force wreaking havoc over the city, the nation and the world at large.As the city looks to balance the effects of climate change with fostering social equity, transportation is at the forefront of the conversation.Hidden in a plethora of articles about Black Friday savings and Thanksgiving leftover recipes, the White House released the fourth National Climate Assessment, which found transportation contributes the highest amount of greenhouse gases over any other sector.Sixty percent of those emissions are from light-weight vehicles, like cars, according to the EPA.Satya Rhodes-Conway, senior outreach specialist for the Center of Wisconsin Strategy and mayoral candidate, said the only way to effectively reduce emissions is to get at the center of the problem: transportation.“If you are looking at sustainability and reducing climate emissions, you have to look at the transportation sector,” Rhodes-Conway said. “Otherwise you’re just not touching a huge contributor.”Those who have a choice in how they ride, or choice riders, have different options in transportation, usually live downtown and have frequent, convenient and fast service, Robbie Webber, SSTI senior associate, said. Those who don’t have a choice in transportation, on the other hand, are referred to as lifeline riders. These riders usually live in places where bus stops are fewer and further in between.‘Scottholes’ campaign critical of Walker’s handling of transportation infrastructure
A statewide union of engineers has been flying a plane over campus during Badger football game days with a banner Read…Sundquist said choice riders tend to use their own vehicle. In turn, the city will have more congestion and air pollution and will lose out on public transportation fees.But those who can’t afford a car are stuck, Sundquist said.“They’re limited in places they can apply to work and actually work,” Sundquist said. “They have huge personal burdens … They may not be able to get to school or food stores.”Additionally, those who live on the outskirts of Madison often face a tradeoff between affordable housing and transportation access, which Sundquist said is “a big mismatch.”The cost of housing tends to be cheaper off the isthmus than in downtown Madison. But when factoring in transportation costs, individuals who live in these more affordable areas oftentimes spend more than those who live downtown, according to the housing and transportation index.“You give people more opportunities when they don’t have to rely on a car,” Webber said. “It’s just pulling them down by a weight in the water.”And while ride-hailing options, including Uber and Lyft, reduce the need to own a car, they eat away at transit ridership, Sundquist said. Thus, it erodes funding from the transit system and adds to emissions.When families on the outskirts do have to rely on cars, they may have to drive longer because they’re further away from everything. That in turn contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, Sundquist said. It’s essential to develop schools, stores, grocery stores and other necessities close together so people don’t have to rely on only one type of transportation.“If you live in these neighborhoods, you have a very low percentage of jobs in the regions that are within a half an hour or 45 minutes,” Trowbridge said. “We hear stories of people living in these neighborhoods and it takes them 90 minutes to two hours because they have to transfer.”Systemwide, about 18.9 percent of all riders transfer buses. For white people it’s 14.9 percent, black people 48.4 percent and low-income 34.3 percent.The bus system in place now is inefficient, especially outside of the transfer points, Webber said. Outside those transfer points, there may only be weekday hours, or peak hours.“If you live on the edge of town, you probably have one bus. It may only run during peak hours and maybe, if you’re really lucky, it runs once an hour during off-peak,” Webber said. “Maybe it runs on weekends, maybe it runs at night. If it doesn’t then you’re totally screwed. If you miss that one bus, you have to wait an hour. That makes your travel time really long.”The solution would seem to be better coverage and more frequent service, but the funds are limited, Webber said.But the fact of the matter is it’s difficult to provide coverage to those who live in the urban sprawl, Sundquist said.Funding for transportation isn’t unlimited, and it’s often cheaper to provide more frequent busing to a smaller space where there are more people than it is to extend service, Webber said.  “[Transportation] is critical to all sorts of different pieces of daily life,” Rhodes-Conway said. “And so the accessibility, the convenience, the cost of transportation all play a huge role in … whether there’s an equitable opportunity.”The man sat next to me on the bus and our conversation volleyed back and forth for the whole 40 minutes it took me to get from the bus stop to my apartment.He’s taken the six every Friday to get from his house on West Washington, transfers buses around the Capitol and takes the bus to the mosque on East Washington. And then he does the same thing to get back.He also told me he shattered his foot playing soccer a while back and hasn’t been able to work since.I’m able bodied, which is a fortune I don’t think about very often. Plus, living in downtown Madison, I’m within less than 0.1 miles from seven bus stops and a B-Cycle station. If I weren’t able bodied, I would have options.On the outskirts, where development is spread out, accessibility to public transportation is more limited. This partially has to do with not having enough place to store buses and a lack of funding for more routes, Ald. Zach Wood, District 8 said.The Madison bus system is currently set up for people who commute downtown, Rhodes-Conway said. But the system isn’t set up to move people from downtown to jobs on the periphery, further widening the gap.Setting up an equitable metro system leaves the city with choices to make. Like many cities, Madison has tried to maintain a balance, Webber said.The city can set up transit for either choice riders or lifeline riders to fulfill either environmental or equity goals respectively. The city is trying to maintain both options despite lack of funding, Webber said.But because service doesn’t extend past city limits into neighboring cities like Middleton and Fitchburg unless those governments pay for service, Madison cannot adequately balance environmental and equity goals.Officials discuss campus carry, sexual assault, transportation at Safety Town Hall
Government officials, authority figures and community members gathered Wednesday night to explore solutions to various safety issues facing University of Read…Bus rapid transit could be a solution to that.BRT is a bussing system that would have limited stops and quicker service, connecting people from their homes to their closest bus stop. Madison plans to pilot BRT so it first runs from the east corridor to the west, where there’s job density and more choice riders. BRT looks to address both climate and equity goals, Trowbridge, who leads Madison’s project, said.It would have its own lane and traffic signals, which would allow it to travel quicker, reducing idle times and speeding up travel time, Trowbridge said. Additionally, it would come every 10 to 15 minutes.  The first public hearing for BRT will be held Dec. 12 at Madison Public Library from 6 to 8 p.m.“If we really want to … double [ridership] like the mayor says he wants to, we really have to do something like bus rapid transit. Something that really provides the fast service,” Trowbridge said. “If you’re driving now, there’s really no incentive to ride the bus unless it’s much faster. You do see some cost savings, but is it worth an hour extra each way? We really need to work on that.”  While there’s enthusiasm at the city level, financially there isn’t much interest in increasing transit at the statewide level, Trowbridge said. Plus, funding from the federal government is stagnant, which makes for an intense competition for grants between different cities interested in expanding transportation.There’s interest out there to eventually expand transportation outside Madison. But regional planning and intergovernmental cooperation is necessary.The Metro doesn’t stop on Monona Drive, an entity of the city of Monona.It just moseys its way down the road until it’s back in the city of Madison.Some call it petty, others call it a lack of regional transit authority. For municipalities that pay for transportation, like Fitchburg, Middleton and Verona, the bus will run to the requested amount of service the city — or in Verona’s case, Epic — pays for, Webber said. Monona has its own transit system which isn’t part of the Metro.Wisconsin is the only state in the Midwest that doesn’t have an RTA, something taken away by the Walker administration, Webber said. This affects the way transportation in the region operates.“If you have a regional transit authority, or some other sort of mechanism to provide [funds] … there’s ways that communities have figured this out and have really seen their systems grow,” Trowbridge said. “We can’t just create an RTA, the state needs to give us authority, which is a problem because we have these legislators up north who have no clue what transit is. They just think it’s wasteful for cities and don’t really get how it helps cities grow sustainably.”Madison’s population grew the most of any municipality in the state last year, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. Fitchburg, Sun Prairie and Verona were also among the top ten gainers.With the growth the city has seen, there’s a vast need for a more comprehensive transportation system to maintain and improve Madisonians’ quality of life and livability, Lerner said.With new leadership, Trowbridge is hopeful that an RTA is in the cards, allowing for service to surrounding municipalities where need is high.“This intergovernmental agreement model is just very short-sighted and very difficult to sustain,” Trowbridge said. “These communities are under levy limits as well, and they can’t afford to always have the level of transit they need. They have other needs, they’re growing.”Right now, the focus is to help pay for the first phase of BRT.Historically, a pattern of funding shortages and lack of emphasis on transportation is evident across the state.Dane County has looked at a commuter rail, streetcar and a high speed rail, Webber said. The high speed rail was supposed to connect Chicago to Milwaukee to Madison to the Twin Cities, a project which the state got $810 million for and Gov. Scott Walker rejected in 2010, according to Wisconsin Public Radio.At a local level, the city bought a few electric buses as a nod to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and they’re still looking to add regular buses for additional routes, Wood said. But a few years ago, Madison’s federal grant proposal to add additional storage for buses was beat out by Milwaukee’s proposal to build streetcars.“There are more good projects across the country asking for that money than there is money available,” Wood said. “Not every project that deserves the money unfortunately is going to get it.”Former Madison Mayor discusses bike infrastructure, alternative transportation in urban planning

Shannon Kim, an Read…Rhodes-Conway said there hasn’t been enough attention at any governmental level to transportation initiatives.In an upcoming local election season, where all of the seats for city council and the mayor’s office are up for grabs, positive change for transportation initiatives could be in the limelight.Mayoral candidate Rhodes-Conway said sustainable, rapid transportation is a top priority for her.“[Rapid transit] is one of the very short list of things that determine the path that Madison goes on and what kind of city we’re going to be,” Rhodes-Conway said. “If we don’t invest in rapid transit now, traffic just gets worse, it gets harder and harder to get downtown, it gets more discouraging … just a whole cascade of problems.”Changes start when politicians have the political will, or the courage to reallocate funds from one priority to another, Rhodes-Conway said.“We’ve been talking about bus rapid transit in this community for 30 years,” Rhodes-Conway said. “I don’t see any big red rapid buses on the street.”Right now, the city has “picked the low-hanging fruit,” Webber said. They’ve turned old rail corridors into bike and walking paths and put cut-throughs between apartment buildings. But in terms of tangible reductions to car traffic on the roads, the city has yet to pick that apple.For example, new construction on roads like Monroe Street saw an addition of a lane during rush hour traffic to and from the city, with the three lanes switching off, Webber said. But during peak times, pedestrians have three lanes to cross instead of two and no bike path, which prioritizes parking and moving cars. This helps neither environmental nor equity goals.That priority lies within the constituents’ commitment to and awareness of sustainable transportation. And with reports of how climate change is increasingly shaping the way of the future, it’s time for local action, Lerner said.“What I think about is, how do we build a transit system that makes people’s lives easier and that speaks to the woman who is trying to get a job and misses her job interview because she missed the bus and the next bus doesn’t come for an hour,” Rhodes-Conway said. “That shouldn’t happen.”","Right of Way: Inaccessible public transportation limits employment, affordable housing options for Madison’s outskirts",UWM

She pointed to polls indicating an American public with increasingly anti-immigrant and anti-minority views.  “It is my impression that anti-minority groups and vocal expressions have been rising for some time now,” Oliver said.Oliver speculated that the election of former President Barack Obama in 2008 stoked the flames for the white nationalist and white identity movements — groups that espouse extreme anti-Semitism — to make a slow rise over the last decade.Oliver believes the rise in anti-Semitic incidents reflects the emboldening of individuals espousing anti-minority views to enter into mainstream political discussion.“We do have a polarized world in which we make extreme statements about other people,” Oliver said. “There is definitely a polarized rhetoric that is providing kind of a national conversation within which anti-minority statements are normalized in public discourse.”Experts point to President Trump’s election as reason for nationwide increase in hate groups

Steinberger cited the center’s engagement with other student groups, churches and synagogues in the Madison area.Steinberger also mentioned UW Hillel’s participation in a seminar called “The Necessity of Now” in Washington DC. Hillel sent a group of UW students of different origins, ethnicities and faiths there to take part in sessions discussing multicultural perspectives on a variety of contemporary political issues like immigration and gun control.“We want to provide a space where students can share and learn about each other’s personal and cultural narratives and commit to a deeper understanding of themselves and each other,” Steinberger said.UW Hillel hosts discussion about sexual assault on campus, in Jewish community
In light of recent events in the media surrounding sexual assault, the University of Wisconsin Hillel hosted a discussion Thursday Read…Misunderstanding and fractures in these shared narratives are endemic to acts of hate, Oliver said. A key motivator for hateful aggressors is a misperception of their minority targets as hostile or enemies.  “Rhetoric that polarizes and makes you feel like the other side is so bad that you should try to drive them out of the society is going to make you feel fearful and angry,” Oliver said.Steinberger acknowledged combating this kind of misunderstanding can be challenging.Steinberger invited UW students to try visiting Hillel for their weekly Shabbat dinner, which non-Jewish students often attend as well.“Students know that everyone is welcome,” Steinberger said. “It’s an opportunity for them to observe a cultural experience with openness and no pressure. I think it allows some of the barriers of otherness to fall away so that people can say who are the Jewish people and ask any questions they wish to ask.”","As anti-Semitic incidents increase across US, UW Hillel strives for unity, awareness",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/09/19/uhs-strives-to-expand-mental-health-services-despite-financial-restraints/,"Sep 19, 2016","Despite the University of Wisconsin’s budgetary challenges, University Health Services is expanding its services to better serve the needs of underrepresented students.As a part of UW’s new cultural competency initiatives to promote inclusivity and diversity on campus, UHS has taken the first step in a multi-year process to expand mental health staffing.To address the needs of underrepresented students, UHS has hired two professionals who specialize in the needs of students of color, said Andrea Lawson, UHS interim co-director of mental health services.Along with the two recent hires, Lisa Imhoff and Simone Collins, who will primarily work with students of color on campus, UHS added two post-doctoral residents to their team and have secured permanent funding for two academic year counselors, Lawson added.As a biracial, former first-generation college student herself, new UHS hire Lisa Imhoff can empathize with the struggle some underrepresented students face when seeking mental health services.Imhoff said historically, underrepresented and underserved students don’t always have access to mental health services.“There may be a stigma surrounding seeking mental health services, or there might be shame involved depending on family of origin and cultural issues where mental health is not understood or understood differently,” Imhoff said.Coming from a similar background as the students she works with, Imhoff said there is a need to reach underserved students on UW campus — especially with the current climate.[UPDATED] Hundreds protest arrest of UW student on campus

New to UHS, Imhoff said she can tell UHS prioritizes the needs of students of color and that they truly care.“I would hope that students of color and underserved, underrepresented students feel safe bringing these concerns to counseling staff at UHS,” Imhoff said. “[UHS] is being sensitive to these issues.”While university officials have voiced their desire to provide more services to underrepresented students on campus, often, they are financially limited in what they can accomplish.With Gov. Scott Walker cutting $250 million from the UW System in the last state budget, departments all around campus have needed to scale down.UW faces ‘chaos, uncertainty’ from state budget cuts in upcoming semesters
From university employment to Revelry, the effects of Gov. Scott Walker’s $250 million cut to the University of Wisconsin System Read…UHS is no exception to this trend. But what makes UHS’s cuts in funding different is that the consequences of limiting mental health services to students may be “disturbing” and “dangerous,” Jack Nitschke, associate professor of psychiatry and psychology, said.“If we make it harder for students to get the services they need, we’re just leaving them to deal with issues like depression and anxiety on their own,” Nitschke said. “With limited resources, we’re not helping educate students on what they can do and show them that there are certain tools that can be taught or medications that can be sought.”If students don’t have access to mental health services, they are left to suffer, Nitschke said. There are many consequences to leaving students to deal with these issues on their own, he said, ranging from self-harm behaviors to extreme cases such as suicide.With a student population of nearly 50,000 undergraduates and graduates, Lawson said unfortunately not everyone can have as much counseling as they want or need.To focus on the needs of most students in the most effective manner, UHS limits the number of individual counseling sessions available to 10 per academic calendar and 20 in their academic degree, Lawson said.That means if a student were to use 10 sessions their freshman year and 10 during their sophomore year, they will have used up their 20 for their undergraduate studies, and will no longer be eligible for individual counseling, Lawson said.Additionally, the School of Engineering and School of Medicine have partnerships that allow students to have an unlimited amount of sessions, Lawson said.“We want to be able to do good with those resources,” Lawson said. “By limiting the number of sessions, we’re also able to extend other resources like drop-in consultations around campus, group counseling and partnerships with organizations like the LGBTQ+ center.”UW falls short on student mental health services
A Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism report revealed the University of Wisconsin System has not met several goals for mental Read…The 10-session cap is not an arbitrary figure, however. Lawson said that the student comes in for an average of four to five sessions — a number that is also reported nationally, according to the Association for University and College Counseling Directors.Despite the 10-session cap for individual counseling, students are still able to access group counseling, wellness services, psychiatric services, access consultations and drop-in consultations in an unlimited amount, Lawson said.Students are also welcome to come into UHS any day from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. to meet with care managers who support students by referring them to additional resources and services.The program Let’s Talk, which meets at five designated locations around campus, provides appointment-free, drop-in consultations at no cost. At each location, a counselor is available to listen, give feedback, offer empathic support, or just be there and help students work through a decision or a problem they’re facing, Lawson said.As UHS slowly begins to expand its budget, Lawson recognizes that limited funding is something that impacts and affects UHS every day.Despite the struggle, the hiring of two new professionals to address the needs of students of color, Lawson said, is one step forward in expanding mental health services at UHS.“If someone were to give us a ton of money, of course we would love to expand our resources,” Lawson said. “If we were able to hire additional staff, we would be able to expand the services we have, whether it’s reevaluating session limit or providing some other targeted service students are in need of.”UHS seeks to improve mental health, sexual assault services — but at an increased cost to students

Despite a strained admin-student relationship, the battle over financial aid persists along with the fight for other BIPOC student demands made in the wake of the reinvigorated Black Lives Matter movement in Madison.From the Black Student Strike of 1969 to the present-day social justice movement on campus, Black student protesters see their story at UW as one continuous fight that has shifted in form, but not cause.As current students make a renewed call for the university to address the grievances of BIPOC students, protesters from 1969 and today reconcile their generational differences for that same cause — justice and equity for Black students on the UW campus.Reckoning Racism on CampusDespite the shockwaves it created in Madison at the time, the Black Student Strike of 1969 is not a well-known event among UW students. Launched amid a growing Black Power movement in the year following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., a group of students organized
under the Black People’s Alliance to protest for a series of 13 demands.The demands centered around recruitment of more minority students and faculty, the creation of a Black Studies department and other accountability initiatives for Black students to attain autonomy over matters relating to their UW experience and education.Harvey Clay arrived on the UW campus in the fall of 1968 into the racial climate that would energize the strike. Recruited as a freshman football player from Texas, Clay came to UW on a football scholarship with hopes that he would find a more welcoming environment than the harsh discrimination he faced in the South. Clay said he soon realized his assumption was wrong.“I found out it wasn’t that much different,” Clay said. “There wasn’t even a Black neighborhood in Madison at the time. There was no hot sauce. There was no barbecue. There was no cornbread. No iced tea. Getting a haircut was a big deal. I didn’t understand all that.”One of the first times the discrimination on campus struck Clay was when Clay asked a football coach for help to plan his course schedule. The coach started to arrange his schedule without his input until Clay told him those classes would not work because he was pre-med. Because Clay would not take simple classes, the coach got mad and told him to “make his own damn schedule.”Between football practices, Clay hung out with some of the white guys in the dorms. Clay said they always seemed nice to him — until politics got involved. “As an athlete, I was okay. As a human being, comme ci comme ça … I wasn’t compliant because I expressed my opinion,” Clay said. “I was just supposed to shut up and play football.”Hines said she experienced a similar culture shock when she arrived on campus to pursue law. Hines graduated from a historically Black college and was heavily active in civil rights protests in Mississippi. She said the tension boiling in Madison from the civil rights movement and anti-Vietnam War protests was the most familiar and welcoming part of campus to her.Though Hines said she felt like an “odd-duck” swimming against the current as one of the few graduate students involved in the strike, she viewed her involvement in the strike as a “straight and clear” line to continue her advocacy.“It just felt like what I was supposed to do, because I wasn’t in Mississippi anymore,” Hines said. “I was in Madison, Wisconsin, and it became clear that the same race issues that predominated in the racially segregated South … were issues in Wisconsin too.”After Hines graduated from the UW Law School, she spent her life litigating various civil rights issues. She was eventually appointed to the bench of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, becoming the first Black woman to ever serve on the state’s highest court.The climate on campus in the fall of 2020 echoed the tension felt on campus in 1969. Following the death of George Floyd, protests erupted across the nation in a recharged Black Lives Matter movement that called for sweeping systemic reforms. These protests reached the UW campus in August, heated by the police shooting of Jacob Blake close to home in Kenosha, Wisconsin.While the headline-catching events sparked the flame for social justice movements in the fall, Bennett and fellow student Jordan Kennedy contend the movement had been building at UW long before. Bennett said she felt isolated within her first few hours at the university as a freshman. As one of 60 students of color in the business school, Bennett said it was a “huge culture shock” to be a student of color in a sea of white faces.When Bennett and other students of color in the Business Emerging Leaders Program — dedicated to bringing people of diverse backgrounds to the business school — were shuffled to the front of the class’s first group photo, she said her fears were realized.“That was my first introduction to what it means to be a student of color here,” Bennett said. “It doesn’t matter if we feel welcomed, if we feel safe — it just matters that our faces are there to pretend that we’re being diverse.”Kennedy said years of advocacy and controversy led to the current climate. In the fall of 2019, UW came under fire due to a Homecoming video that did not feature any students of color. The controversy caused campus-wide pushback, attracted national coverage and ignited the formation of the Student Inclusion Coalition, an organization dedicated to racial justice on campus. Still, Kennedy and Bennett said this summer’s protests revealed a glaring hole at UW that had not been filled.Bennett said she always knew something was “missing” at UW, but had not known what to do about it. Out of this “missing” sentiment, the UW BIPOC Coalition formed. Kennedy, Bennett and several other students who met through the summer’s protests banded together to found the coalition. Their mission is to coalesce BIPOC students and multicultural student organizations to create a unified voice for actionable initiatives at UW.Unified under 10 demands, the founders created a petition from years of outstanding propositions made by other campus advocacy groups such as SIC and the Wisconsin Black Student Union. Bennett and Kennedy said they believe the growing coalition sparks hope to overcome what they see as an even larger obstacle — ending inaction from the administration.“I’m not leaving this campus until something changes, and now, every single one of us in the BIPOC Coalition thinks the same thing,” Bennett said. “I know that we’re not going to stop. We’re not going to stop fighting.”KATIE HARDIE/The Badger HeraldRising to ResistanceThrough a flurry of protests over a few weeks in February of 1969, the Black Student Strike leaders held education rallies, marched down State Street to the Capitol, boycotted classes, disrupted lecture halls and closed off campus building entrances, according to a UW project created in partnership with The Black Voice and the Black Cultural Center.But as protesters amassed in numbers with each demonstration, the response from the university and state government became more volatile.A self-declared “foot soldier” of the strike, Hines said strike leaders would pack into a tiny house on campus to plan their moves. Clay and Hines said the protests manifested in various ways, though strike leaders had to quickly change tactics once they had started. Two thousand students gathered to burn an effigy dummy entitled “UW Administration” on the lap of the Abraham Lincoln statue, according to the UW news site. The next day, 1,500 students blockaded the doors of Bascom Hall, where they were met by Dane County and Capitol police officers dressed in riot gear. As the protesters continually overcame police, Wisconsin Gov. Warren Knowles called in the National Guard.At one of the protests, Clay said he stepped between female students and white male counter protesters — including some of his teammates on the football team. Standing in between the white students and Black protesters at nearly seven feet tall, Clay said he became a target when the Capitol police arrived. The officers beat Clay to the ground, breaking his glasses and hitting his head with a riot stick.“They cracked my head open,” Clay said. “I just felt abused with no way to resolve it.”Clay was one of at least two dozen students arrested by campus and Madison area police during the strike, according to the UW news site. While police met the 1969 protests with physical violence, the university more subtly undermined the students’ efforts.About two-thirds of the university faculty signed a petition in support of the administration’s stance against the strike, according to the UW news site. In a UW Oral History Clip, Agricultural Economics professor C. William Loomer, who was on the Faculty Senate, said the university engaged in a lot of “petty” things during that time.According to Loomer’s account, they used Senate rules and niceties to exclude students from meetings. Loomer said faculty members also chastised and tried to shut down students for how they represented themselves in the meetings, including bringing up their chosen attire or the number of students they brought to speak.“What we were doing was playing games, to some extent … There were enough people in the faculty who were disgusted with the whole thing and didn’t want to listen to any students,” Loomer said in the UW recording.While the strike lost some momentum and had a short moratorium on demonstrations, students reengaged with a short but destructive protest Feb. 27, according to the UW news site. UW administrators met the next week, and on March 3 they met one of the 13 demands to create a Black Studies Department.Though this is considered the end of the strike, the participants continued to endure the impacts of the protests. Clay said the football staff carried disdain for his activism — coupled with his suffering academics, Clay lost his football scholarship and had to leave the university.“I was no different than a stud horse. I was used to make the university money for playing football. End of story. End of usage,” Clay said. “I was there as a chattel-type animal to provide them income. Not to get an education, not to improve my life … unless I was going to do it through football. The fact that I wasn’t compliant with that, they didn’t have a bunch of emotion about taking my scholarship.”Today, students in the BIPOC Coalition continue the fight for the unmet demands from the 1969 Black Student Strike. One of their 10 demands is for the university to reopen discussion on how they can honor the 1969 demands.If not for the pandemic, Bennett said she believes the current campus climate would have been a repeat of 1969, given that students are still calling for some of the same changes Black Student Strike protesters advocated for five decades earlier.Since the BIPOC Coalition’s creation six months ago, The university has met one of their demands, to remove Chamberlin Rock, a campus monument that once had a racist name. Bennett said the BIPOC Coalition has also gained traction in other ways, and they secured two meetings per semester with Chancellor Rebecca Blank mid-fall after advocating for months to get on her schedule.Despite some wins, Bennett and Kennedy said the university has not budged on several demands, such as the removal of the Abraham Lincoln statue on Bascom Hill. Increasingly, the BIPOC Coalition leaders said the university is working against students’ efforts to advocate for their demands.Bennett said working with the university is “traumatizing” and “exhausting.” Despite the research and time they put into ideas, Bennett and Kennedy said students are constantly gaslit and shot down during meetings.“It’s not that we think we’re always right. It’s not that we think all our ideas should be implemented,” Kennedy said. “It’s that everything we bring up is rejected, pushed back, deterred and fought. It is never encouraged, revised, uplifted or anything of that nature.”Bennett and Kennedy also said the university has refused to meet with student representatives following tense back-and-forths about COVID-19 relief for financially disadvantaged students. In an email to student leaders obtained by The Badger Herald, Olstad said all meetings would take place under a new set of rules, including a caveat that meetings would end if individuals engaged in “disrespectful and inappropriate behavior.”In an email statement in response to these claims, UW Communications Director Meredith McGlone said campus leaders held meetings and corresponded with ASM and BIPOC Coalition members over the past few months in a “good-faith effort” to work together on emergency financial support.She said student leaders’ unwillingness to consider alternative routes outside the original proposal after campus leaders raised concerns about its legality have made it “difficult to have productive conversations.” McGlone said they hope the dynamic changes in the future, and in the meantime are focusing on getting relief to students with readily-available funding. While disagreements are inevitable, Kennedy said the “difficult environment” the university has created has existed long before the COVID-19 Relief Fund. Kennedy said it is the administration’s job to speak with students — by pushing them off, he said they are upholding their legacy of pacifying students of color.“We’ve continued to go through this cycle and that’s due to … administration actively deterring, actively pacifying, bringing things down to compromises and silencing the strongest voices,” Kennedy said.Rebuilding RelationshipsMcGlone said in her statement that while the university has made progress on many of the concerns raised in ‘69, they have not accomplished everything they need to do. McGlone said the university has recognized the participants of the strike by producing the award-winning UW news site, inviting participants back to campus to share their experience and welcoming strike participant John Felder as the 2020 Fall Commencement alumni speaker.The College of Letters & Science will also formally recognize the contributions of student activists that led to the establishment of the Department of Afro-American Studies during the 2021 Spring Commencement.“We hear the frustration and pain that current and former students are expressing and that inspires us with a sense of urgency,” McGlone said in the statement. “Our path forward is being forged every day by faculty, staff and students across campus who are working to make meaningful and lasting change.”After UW revoked his scholarship, Clay took classes at the University of Hartford and Antioch University New England, where he eventually obtained his degree. Today, he owns Real BBQ and More in Louisiana, which was named the 26th best BBQ restaurant in the country by Yelp reviewers.Clay said he constantly carries the scars of the strike and years of discrimination with him. Still taken aback by the racism he sees around him, Clay said he grows angrier as time passes. He struggles to explain the persisting inequities in America to his grandchildren, unconvinced white America’s heart will ever grow big enough to envelop and accept Black America.“The difference between Black Lives Matter and what happened in the ‘69 protest [can be] compared to the storming of the White House on [Jan. 6],” Clay said. “Can you imagine what they would have been like had they been Black people? Murder. Hundreds of bodies dead … And that’s the difference from the dichotomy of where are we versus where we should be.”Reflecting on her experience litigating civil rights issues and the current Black Lives Matter movement, Hines said racial issues are “never solved” — they “reinvent themselves.”While she does not keep up with all the latest news at UW, Hines said students must stay vigilant and committed to the fight in order to not lose momentum from this summer’s protests.“I always make the distinction between progress and change. There’s change, but not necessarily progress,” Hines said. “Things have changed [at UW] I’m sure since 1968, but as these new demands seem to suggest, that’s not necessarily progress, and it just reinforces the constancy of the struggle and the need for vigilance.”When it comes to making progress at UW, Clay said he believes the university continues to prioritize monetary gain over the lives and welfare of students. Bennett and Kennedy said the university has demonstrated its willingness to put profit over students time and time again.Bennett said the university has pushed aside key demands, like the removal of the Lincoln statue, and student activists have been told it is non-negotiable because of other university stakeholders. Bennett, Kennedy and Clay agreed the university needs to reconcile its roots as a predominantly white institution and how that plays a role in their monetary motivations.“I think you still have a majority [of] older white men running the university like they always had and so they want to play to cater, but they don’t want to change because they got to give up some of the income,” Clay said.Another major concern Clay, Bennett and Kennedy brought up was the persisting lack of diversity and UW’s failure to recruit students and faculty of color.In 1974, early race and ethnicity data indicated that 2% of UW students were Black, according to the UW news site. Preliminary data from 2020 shows that 2.19% of students identify as Black — less than a .2% increase in over nearly half a century. The 1969 and the 2020 demands both call for increased efforts in this area.In her statement to The Badger Herald, McGlone said increasing student and faculty diversity remains an integral part of UW’s mission to improve the experience of students of color on campus. While progress “may feel slow,” McGlone said the university is encouraged by the nearly 20% increase in students of color who entered UW in the fall of 2020.Additional initiatives like Bucky’s Tuition Promise, the Target of Opportunity Program, the PEOPLE program and the Mercile J. Lee Scholars Program all contribute to the university’s efforts to increase diversity, McGlone said.To fix the errors he experienced first-hand in the past, Clay said the university must examine “every facet” — including where students come from, their educational background and fiscal resources — to level the academic and social playing field at UW.In addition to implementing their demands, Bennett and Kennedy said student leaders hope to regain autonomy that they believe was lost due to shared governance statute changes in Act 55. Bennett and Kennedy said the BIPOC Coalition will not fold to administrators, though they believe that invoking a higher shared governance standard will empower the student voice and pave the way for necessary structural changes.Looking toward a brighter future, the two generations of Black leaders on the UW campus shared the same somber sentiment — the fight must go on.“I don’t think that [students] should measure success by necessarily getting everything you want. Although you will continue to struggle for that, you decide that you’re going to be on the side of justice,” Hines said. “That’s the message that I would give: wherever you are, do what you can, because that’s what it’s going to take.”","Different century, same fight: Black students battle for same causes half a century later",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2016/11/04/how-social-media-made-waves-in-the-2016-election/,"Nov 4, 2016","In 140 characters or less, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s tweets have the power to reach into the homes of potential voters through their 10.1 million and 12.8 million Twitter followers, respectively.This form of communication through Twitter is demonstrative of how social media can be used to send a direct message to thousands of people across the country, without the necessity of advertisements or use of other mediums, University of Wisconsin professor of life sciences communication Dietram Scheufele said.Throughout the 2016 presidential election, campaigns have used social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and even Snapchat as ways to connect with millions of online users in an effort to convey their messages.With trending hashtags like #Hillaryforprison and #dumpTrump, the 2016 election has been one of the most heated and hate-filled in recent history. Though personal attacks against individual candidates’ families and characters is as old as America’s democracy, UW senior lecturer of life sciences communication Michael Flaherty said the level of such attacks has been shocking.Presidential campaigns make final bid to win over UW students
Engrossed in their cellphones, approximately 20 students sit in a room filled to the brim with “WI Back Her” posters, Read…This is the first election where candidates don’t shake hands at a debate, where a candidate gets booed at a fundraiser that’s supposed to be a “light-hearted evening” and one of the first instances where violence has been breaking out across the campaign, Scheufele said.“We’ve reached a point where social media has really kind of reinforced existing divisions and maybe made them worse,” Scheufele said. “It’s going to be really difficult as a country after this election to come back together as a country and find common ground again.”President Obama used social media effectively throughout the 2008 and 2012 elections to advertise his platform and raise campaign funds, Flaherty said.Although Obama’s campaign demonstrated how social media could be used as a powerful fundraising tool, Trump’s campaign has been able to break a number of new fronts to show how social media can be used for more than just fundraising.There has never been a national campaign like Trump’s, where daily tweets are turned into a national story, Flaherty said. Trump is a “professional showman” who understands the importance of marketing media.Crooked Hillary should not be allowed to run for president. She deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER getting a subpoena from U.S. Congress. RIGGED!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2016“He’s kind of a shock jock,” Flaherty said. “He really says shocking things on purpose to drive ratings, and he’s good at it, but at some point if you want to be president of the United States you can’t just be lighting the fire everyday and hoping that no one’s going to check your facts.” “At some point if you want to be president of the United States you can’t just be lighting the fire everyday and hoping that no one’s going to check your facts.”
Michael FlahertyThe attention Trump’s campaign has received can be explained in two ways, Scheufele said. Trump avoids the media because he sees it as crooked or biased and instead chooses to send his message directly to voters. In this way, he doesn’t even have to go through a journalist.Trump has also used social media as a way to build the Trump brand and create a personality cult around him, rather than the Republican party itself, he said. Essentially, he has stopped all other forms of fundraising and is just fundraising online.Trump’s online fundraising is more favorable toward his campaign than to the Republican Party’s campaign.

Aside from being the first female presidential candidate, Clinton’s campaign has only told voters things they already know about her.Voters have cultivated negative reactions toward Trump because of his own actions, Flaherty said, and not necessarily because of anything Clinton has done herself.Anyone who sees and treats women this way is unfit to be president. pic.twitter.com/aRXRfItr0r— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 1, 2016“It will be interesting after this election to see the analysis of how many people were motivated by social media to move from one camp to the other — I don’t know how that’s going to play out,” Flaherty said. While the use of social media as a fundraising tool in the presidential election has raised millions in campaign funds, its also effectively divided supporters of the two candidates into two passionately driven groups, Scheufele said.Social media has separated Americans with its portrayal of people who support “crazy” Trump and those who support “crooked Hillary,” Scheufele said. Not only do groups passionately oppose the other candidate, but each side truly believes that the other is bad for the future of America.So terrible that Crooked didn't report she got the debate questions from Donna Brazile, if that were me it would have been front page news!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2016If Trump and Clinton supporters were asked if they believed the other campaign was out to destroy America, one quarter to one third of partisans in each group would say “yes,” Scheufele said.Scheufele said research has shown hearing information from one side of an argument and not from both sides of an argument makes people less knowledgeable about the purpose of America’s democracy.Clinton has been the focal point of attacks on social media for years, Flaherty said. For 20 years, media outlets have continuously been used to question not only her character but whether she is a true law-abiding citizen.It’s not to say that Clinton’s “nose is clean,” but it’s an example of how social media has been used as an effective campaign strategy to disprove her character, Flaherty said. These kind of attacks have caused both presidential nominees to be questioned, and it’s the first time public approval for both presidential candidates is less than 50 percent.But the social media attacks on the candidates aren’t the only thing that makes America look more politically divided then it actually is.If someone were to examine the polls, they would find that Americans are not as polarized as social media would lead people to believe, Flaherty said. Even on issues where there is a lot of disagreement, like trade, Americans are more unified than one would think.It all comes down to how questions on these issues are phrased and presented on social media. Trump often talks about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and his presentation of the deal is what people object to, Flaherty said.In the past, social media has been used to spin issues and people often object this distorted version of the issues and not the true facts.“Social media takes this to a new level of rhetoric and reinforced values upon which people vote and form their opinions,” Flaherty said.",How social media made waves in the 2016 election,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2016/10/11/swiping-right-college-students-seek-more-than-just-hookups-through-dating-apps/,"Oct 11, 2016","Prior to meeting her fiancé, University of Wisconsin senior Jenna Wroblewski had her fair share of failed Tinder matches.Dating app users often find the platforms can function as either a means to solely hook up, or an opportunity to form a relationship.Two summers ago, Wroblewski found her long-term relationship on Tinder in Norway and said, “rare is an understatement” to describe the successful match.“My relationship, begrudgingly thanks to Tinder, is more than I could have ever anticipated,” Wroblewski said. “I’m so happy that things have turned out the way they have, based on Tinder’s reputation as a strictly hook-up app.”While Wroblewski acknowledged the stigma attached to Tinder relationships, new UW research suggests she is not alone in her success.MARISSA HAEGELE/The Badger HeraldBreaking down the pros and cons of popular dating apps
Valentine’s Day has come and gone, but not everyone had a lively, amorous weekend. If you had a lonesome holiday, The Read…Catalina Toma, UW assistant professor of communication science, has studied and surveyed dating app users as a mass group. Through her forthcoming study, “There are plenty of fish in the sea: Effects of choice overload and reversibility on online daters’ satisfaction with selected partners,” Toma revealed approximately one third of recent long-term relationships emerged from online interactions.Despite user misconceptions, dating apps make up “a billion dollar industry,” Toma said.Match Group, the parent company of OKCupid, Match.com and Tinder, had a 2015 revenue of more than $1 billion.As a part of the most popular demographic using dating apps, college students both contribute to and benefit from the success of the online platforms, Toma said.“It makes sense if you think about it,” Toma said. “Online dating is helpful for people who have a difficult time finding potential partners in everyday life. Perhaps you are really busy professionally, or you have moved into a new atmosphere, like college, and don’t know anyone.”“My relationship, begrudgingly thanks to Tinder, is more than I could have ever anticipated. I’m so happy that things have turned out the way they have, based on Tinder’s reputation as a strictly hook-up app.”
Jenna WroblewskiTinder, for example, has more than 50 million users worldwide. The app built its large user base through initially marketing to college students, reaching half a million users in six months.The notion of dating apps as a means to solely hook up is one idea Toma, and users like Wroblewski, have turned on its head. In Toma’s study, she found that meeting a long-term partner via dating apps or websites is not all that uncommon. Toma said her study demonstrated that dating apps are one of the most common ways to meet a long-term partner, second only to meeting through friends. Between 2005 and 2012, 35 percent of long-term relationships originated from an online meeting. Fifty percent of those relationships started through dating apps or websites, according to Toma’s study.As the number of online outlets to meet potential partners grows, UW is also working to address a new set of problems they may pose to healthy relationship development.University Health Services originally stressed the importance of healthy dating in the Tonight program, a sexual violence awareness program for first-year and transfer students, Carmen Noveldt, assistant director of End Violence on Campus, said.While the Tonight program will be phased out by fall 2017, an updated program will replace it.Noveldt said UHS found it necessary to incorporate separate workshops for dating and the promotion of safe and consensual sex. Dubbed DatingWIse and SexWIse, the in-person workshops encourage students to reflect on their personal lives and what it means to engage in a healthy college relationship.DatingWIse encourages college students to reflect on who they want to date and what they want to get out of a relationship, Noveldt said. It helps students assess their needs and how to disagree with a partner in a healthy manner, she said.“It empowers students to really think through who they want to date,” Noveldt said. “Long term and short term, what are their deal breakers? Who are they as people and who do they want to date as people? It bolsters their ability to be validated, that they’re worthy of the respect, but also helps them explore who they are.”While some students prefer to seek relationships in person, many are resorting to a slew of dating apps. MARISSA HAEGELE/The Badger HeraldToma and colleague Mina Choi published a study earlier this year, entitled “Mobile Media Matters”, which identifies whether dating apps can enable healthy relationship formation. The study showed that relying on technology to manage relationships was not only beneficial to couples pursuing long-distance relationships, but also to those who reside close to each other and have consistent, in-person contact.The study showed dating partners who used mobile media reported high communication levels, a first step toward a healthy relationship, Noveldt said.Still, a negative psychological effect of dating apps is their presentation of an unlimited array of options, which causes people to frequently think there might be somebody better. This mentality could be detrimental to being happy with one’s partner, Toma said.Toma’s “There are plenty of fish in the sea” study results showed that participants who were presented with six different options as opposed to 24 were more satisfied with their final choice.Despite dating apps’ success in fostering long-term relationships, the platform has its share of drawbacks — particularly for women.While using Tinder proved ultimately successful for Wroblewski, she took issue with how men had interacted with her. She averted hookups and went on a couple of dates, but, prior to meeting her fiance, her experience was “lackluster.”“I quickly grew tired of sifting through a slew of bad pick-up lines and blatant sexism,” Wroblewski said. “I did once change my profile pictures to miscellaneous coffee cups and posed as a cup — and was incessantly objectified.”Sexism and objectification of women have deterred many of them from dating app platforms, perhaps playing into the general misconception that they primarily serve as a place to find hookups, Wroblewski said.

Welcome to college, an era of experimentation and education that reaches far outside the classroom. Such newfound independence and freedom Read…Tinder has granted heterosexual users a fast and convenient means of connecting, but Tinder’s CEO Sean Rad has said they are working on a more positive user experience for members of the LGBTQ+ community. Other apps like Grindr are specifically tailored to gay, bisexual and queer men.UW junior Jack Larson’s experiences with both Tinder and Grindr have been primarily negative, he said, criticizing the hook-up culture he witnessed, though he was successful in finding a few short-term relationships and friendships. Larson, however, said the availability of dating apps in general is a positive aspect, particularly for the LGBTQ+ community.“They are good to have available,” Larson said. “Especially for the LGBTQ community, who may find it harder to meet people the more traditional way.”Dating apps can lead to long-term, fulfilling relationships, but their format can perpetuate stereotypical thinking and other detrimental mindsets. This can be an issue in a relationship later on and lead to unrealistic and heightened expectations for a partner, Toma said.She said dating apps like Tinder provide a limited amount of information, primarily focused on visual presentation through photographs and a brief biography. With the feature of swiping left or right, Tinder users make fast, split-second decisions based on immediate physical attraction.“The hallmark of this idealization loop is that it makes online interactants experience greater social and/or romantic attraction toward their partners than they would have experienced had the interaction taken place face-to-face.”
Catalina TomaNot only does the app highlight physical attractiveness but social status, two important but superficial factors taken into consideration when deciding who to date, Toma said.Giving users the option to list their occupation and school reflects an opportunity to showcase social status. This can be problematic, however, and lead to what Toma called “idealization,” in which one person mentally fills in the blanks with information fitting an existing stereotype. This can be precarious for dating, prompting imagined qualities of a prospective partner that may not be correct.“The hallmark of this idealization loop is that it makes online interactants experience greater social and/or romantic attraction toward their partners than they would have experienced had the interaction taken place face-to-face,” Toma said.Though dating apps aren’t for everyone, the numbers don’t lie.Contrary to popular belief, 80 percent of Tinder users aren’t looking for a one night stand or a hookup, but rather for a relationship, Toma said. Dating apps don’t necessarily lead people to behave one way or another. Instead, they simply facilitate dating and dating related “desires,” Toma said.

Due to the way online streaming has changed the way Billboard counts album listens, having more songs in an album increases the probability of having the album go gold or platinum.With all the attention focused on sexual predators and abusers, such as recent allegations against Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, it seems especially ballsy for Brown to try such an incredibly self-serving tactic.Majid Jordan’s sophomore album relies too heavily on synthesizers, lacks substance
Majid Jordan is known for their crooning over jazzy synthesizers and their new album, The Space Between, provides a heavy Read…Individuals in popular culture, from Hollywood to Top 40 charts, continue to have successful careers following instances of inter-partner violence and sexual misconduct.It’s vital to not only acknowledge these instances but to also stop supporting abusive or predatory celebrities. No matter how much you enjoy a particular artist’s style, voice or anything else, by supporting their career, you are enabling their behavior.You cannot “separate the art from the artist” when you take into account the violence he or she committed.So, here’s a list of better ways to spend two hours and 40 minutes than supporting another abuser.I know this is something you’re all behind on. In the two hours and 40 minutes it would take to listen to that insufferable album, you can completely wash and dry about two loads of laundry.A brilliant and empowering piece of pop magic, ANTI — released in 2016 — definitely deserves another listen (if you haven’t listened to it 25+ times already). With fast-paced rhythms perfect for dancing, ANTI is by far a superior listening option.While you’re at it, support Brown’s ex-girlfriend further by steering clear of all of his music — old and new — and instead visit her website and buy products from Fenty Beauty.Following the 45 minute recipe shared by our Cooking Sucks columnist, Chef Sogs, an individual would be able to complete the recipe three times in the time it would take him or her to listen to Heartbreak on a Full Moon all the way through — and still have enough time to sit down and enjoy it, too.Cults kept High Noon Saloon fans entertained with throwbacks, recent hits
Cults graced the High Noon Saloon with their presence Oct. 25, delivering everything you could expect and more.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2020/11/17/sharing-governance-student-leaders-question-uws-representation-of-the-student-body/,"Nov 17, 2020","When Matthew Mitnick first set foot on the University of Wisconsin campus as a freshman, he aspired to take part in the acclaimed shared governance system, which provides legal grounds for academic staff, faculty and students’ involvement in decision-making processes at UW System schools.Within shared governance, Mitnick hoped to make real change on the UW campus, and three years later, Mitnick now sits as the chair of the Associated Students of Madison — UW student government’s highest office.But, instead of aspiring to make change within the shared governance system, Mitnick now finds himself asking a new question altogether.“If you want to create change, do you work within the system and acquiesce to what they want … or do you just say ‘you know screw it, this whole system is corrupt as hell, let’s just create a new one?’” Mitnick said. “That’s something that we, even in ASM, have been talking about, and I personally think we should change the system because the system isn’t working.”In a year where UW’s student government has publicly clashed with the university on several hot-button issues, student leaders are questioning the university’s approach to represent the student voice in the face of administrative opposition and the erosion of shared governance systems.Breaking down (of) shared governanceWith any decision made by ASM, Mitnick and other student representatives rely on a short but powerful statute in Wisconsin legislation — §36.09(5).§36.09(5) makes UW System student government organizations like ASM official parts of the Wisconsin state government through the principles of shared governance, according to the ASM website.While the statute requires UW System schools to obtain student approval of certain policies before they can go into effect, Mitnick and other student leaders across campus have recently raised concerns that the university is not elevating the student voice on current issues such as COVID-19 and social justice.In the fall semester, ASM passed a vote of no confidence in UWPD and endorsed a “Moral Restart” — both resolutions directly contradicted the university’s public stances on social justice initiatives and the pandemic, and students thought it might result in UW administrative action.As it turns out, these resolutions alone do not bind the university to any action. Mitnick said the university’s failure to act on these resolutions and their exclusion of student voices may tie back to recent restrictions on shared governance laws.Mitnick said legislative changes made to §36.09(5) in 2015 watered down the powers of shared governance, directly affecting the current state of student-university negotiations and contributing to the lack of action on those prominent ASM resolutions.§36.09(5) originally stated students “shall be active participants in the immediate governance of and policy development for such institutions.” But in 2015, under the Act 55 budgetary bill, former governor Scott Walker’s administration changed the statute’s wording to state students “shall have primary responsibility for advising the chancellor regarding the formulation and review of policies concerning student life, services and interests.”This change in the statutory language shifted students’ rights from governing themselves to providing input to university administrators, according to an ASM report on shared governance at UW.Mitnick said this change invested more power in the chancellor and administrators by allowing those individuals to selectively listen to — or if they so choose, to ignore — students.“I sometimes think we’re just sitting there for an hour to check their box that ‘oh yep, we had that meeting,’ but there’s no guarantee that anything we say is going to actually be utilized … it really drastically undermines [student government], and it makes ASM just a blanket organization,” Mitnick said.In an email statement to The Badger Herald, university spokesperson Meredith McGlone said the active participation of faculty, academic staff and students remains a crucial part of the decision-making process at the university.McGlone said shared governance partners are involved in campus decisions about academics, research, campus climate and safety, diversity and inclusion initiatives and other campus-wide issues.“Although shared governance is no longer enshrined in state law, UW-Madison continues to abide by its principles,” McGlone said in the statement.A UW TimelineFormer ASM director Jena Olson worked with UW’s student government from 2004 to 2008. The professional staff — employed by the university — works with student government representatives to help them understand their rights and facilitate their navigation of the university system.Olson said there was often tension between the university and ASM during her time as director. With this tension, Olson said administrators attempted to undermine the student voice consistently.“I didn’t generally have the impression that a lot of staff and faculty felt like students needed to be taken seriously,” Olson said. “[They thought] they were too young, too inexperienced to be able to speak to things that were concerning to them.”Olson said she believes students were often only included as a formality because administrators were legally bound to do so by §36.09(5). During her tenure as director, Olson said ASM professional staff frequently referred back to state statutes in order to convince administrators that students had the right to be a part of decisions.Administrators would try to work around the statute when it was in full force by arguing certain decisions did not affect student life, Olson said. These tactics tried to exclude students from shared governance processes.“The statute was the thing that gave everything teeth, and to have that gutted, I am not surprised to hear that shared governance is not as strong,” Olson said. “We already had trouble with people even giving more than paying lip service to it.”Former ASM chair Austin Evans said “36095” used to be the answering machine code for ASM’s landline. While perhaps an insignificant anecdote, Evans said it was a testament to how ingrained the statute is within ASM, as the root from which all their work takes power.Chair of ASM from 2003 to 2005 before changes were made to shared governance laws, Evans said the ASM leaders had a good relationship with the university administration during his tenure. But, he still witnessed some similar student advisory board tactics and workarounds to avoid listening to student complaints.“We have a great system to elect people, and if the university thinks that they’re just going to select pictures of voices they want to hear, again, that’s bullshit, and that’s the kind of stuff that’s offensive to people who are elected,” Evans said.Evans added the statute changes to shared governance have uprooted the proper roles of administrators and students. With a background in public policy and corporate governance law, experience as a partner at a law firm in California and time as a leader for the UW Alumni Association chapter in San Diego — his views on shared governance converge multiple areas of his expertise.Evans said it is easy for administrators to suppress the student voice if they choose, so the university-student relationships must be mutual for the system to work the way it is designed.“We really do make a lot better decisions as a group, when we can hear each other out and come to that level of mutual respect that we expect from each other,” Evans said. “And if there’s gonna be some systematic way of reducing the students’ input from mandatory to advisory, it’s disappointing, and it’s going to foster these breakdowns we’re experiencing right now.”Consequences of shared governance breakdownsBased on his observations of administrative conduct and his view of eroded shared governance, Mitnick said UW administrators pick and choose which student leaders to meet with. Mitnick said the university creates student advisory committees that selectively exclude opposing voices from within student government and the broader student body.While ASM does appoint some of the student representatives on certain advisory boards, Mitnick said university administrators’ control over these boards does not guarantee any student input given at meetings is actually taken into account for decisions.“Administrators present at those meetings have a say in how that agenda is crafted and essentially have control over the process determining who’s in the room and who isn’t,” Mitnick said. “So is it a way for them to authentically hear us? Or is it a sham [to] make it seem like they’re listening to us?”Co-founder of the UW BIPOC Coalition Juliana Bennett said student BIPOC leaders have faced many barriers in scheduling meetings with Chancellor Rebecca Blank and other administrators. The BIPOC Coalition had their first meeting with the chancellor in late October after semester-long calls to meet with Blank.Mitnick and Bennett said Blank was invited to an ASM meeting in early October, but did not attend the meeting. Mitnick said Blank notified him that she would not be able to attend after finding out the BIPOC Coalition was set to speak. Blank did not specifically credit that to justify her lack of attendance, citing scheduling issues in an email to Mitnick.Mitnick said UW’s refusal to meet with students and their tactics of deflection show the administration’s priorities in its approach to students. Bennett said the student advisory groups and bureaucratic levels of communication try students who want to make change.“We know that these advisory groups don’t really do anything, and in the long run, they don’t actually have change,” Bennett said. “It’s just another means to use the free labor of BIPOC students to pretend like ASM and the university at large is listening.”Mitnick said the weakening of shared governance continues to play a role in campus COVID-19 decisions as well. Mitnick said voices from organizations such as the Teaching Assistants Association and the BIPOC Coalition have been left out of university conversations on the pandemic.Mitnick said he tried to invite TAA representatives or other students to student advisory meetings about COVID-19 plans on several occasions. The individuals were denied permission based on the university’s processes for the committees, Mitnick said.According to an internal ASM report from this summer provided to The Badger Herald, there were no student representatives included on the COVID-19 Smart Restart Project Team. While the UW Smart Restart website states there are other individuals not listed in the plan that do work “behind the scenes,” the ASM report said the official structure references no student entities involved in decision making.The report found the lack of student representation and communication about the pandemic plan violated the shared governance state statute for students’ right to have input in policy regarding student life, services and interests.“The sheer lack of information on this subject implies either a complete failure of communication or more likely, a near-complete failure to include students within the Shared Governance process pertaining to the reopening plan,” the report stated.UW Dean of Students Christina Olstad attended the student council meeting that Blank did not attend in October. Olstad said herself and other administrators listened to the BIPOC Coalition’s feedback, and they look forward to working with BIPOC leaders on their concerns.Olstad said she believes the university makes significant changes through resources like the advisory committees and her virtual office hours.“I welcome the opportunity to work with student activists. I love elevating and advocating for the student voice on campus,” Olstad said. “I don’t want everybody who just thinks everything’s perfect on my advisory boards.”Olstad said she personally reached out and shared information to colleagues about the BIPOC Coalition and TAA Moral Restart demands. All information about COVID-19 strategy teams can be found on the Smart Restart website, Olstad said.Olstad said the university is focused on the data and testing strategy in place to keep students safe.“Our goal is to make sure that we listen to the concerns of all of our students,” Olstad said. “We’ve been receiving a lot of a lot of feedback, a lot of messages of support as well, from students or from parents.”But when it comes to hearing out student feedback, the lack of action on ASM’s recent resolutions highlights why they feel left out of the loop, Mitnick said. Evans added that students deserve a say when it comes to policies that affect them.UW’s COVID-19 plan, he says, falls in that category. The policies directly impact students, hitting them both in their personal life, as they have to return to campus and abide by UW rules, and in their finances when it comes time to pay the tuition bill.Evans said UW also must repair harm done to ASM student leaders and the general student body following UWPD’s tweet that targeted Mitnick’s personal Twitter account.After Mitnick tweeted a UW BIPOC Coalition Letter to the Editor, UWPD tweeted that Mitnick said it was not ASM’s aim to defund or abolish the department.UWPD said in the tweet that Mitnick’s post went against the chair’s stated position with the university police department, ending the tweet with #mixedmessages and an emoji. Mitnick replied by saying he was entitled to his own opinion outside the chair position, and his personal feelings on the subject didn’t mean all of ASM had to abide by it.Evans said the UWPD tweet was offensive and upsetting as a former student government leader, and many former alumni in his network were shocked by UWPD’s response.He said others were not surprised by the university’s actions, claiming the university did similar things to them during their time at UW. Evans sent an email to UW administrators following the event about the university’s “petty and adolescent” response and its effect on shared governance relationships.“As someone who sat in that chair … If I had people who are armed and who are supposed to be in charge of our safety and protection, tweeting stuff like that to me, I would have been really frankly scared,” Evans said. “I think it is absolutely sad, but even more so in the background of the role of policing … I think it was a very ignorant way to respond to what is a legitimate concern by someone who’s in that position.”Evans has not received a response to his email. Olstad and McGlone said the university is committed to repairing the relationship and rebuilding trust following the incident. After UWPD’s tweet went live, Olstad said she personally apologized to Mitnick and reached out to other student leaders.Mitnick said in the apology email, Olstad sent him mental health resources. Olstad said she frequently sends out mental health resources to faculty and students, especially amid the challenging times of the pandemic.“I understand the sentiments, but I felt like that was almost making it seem like I’m the person who needs help and I’m the problem,” Mitnick said. “I just thought it was inappropriate for an administrator to do.”Olson said that in her experience as ASM’s director, administrators are not going to include students in conversations about contentious issues out of the “goodness of their heart.” She sees many similarities between her time at UW and the present in how much students have to fight for their voices to be heard.The UW administration always talked about their dedication to social justice during her time as ASM director, Olson said. Fifteen years later, many of the same conversations are still taking place, which she found concerning and frustrating.Transforming the systemMoving forward, Mitnick said he hopes to gain back students’ trust and restore faith in student government. Since he believes many students view ASM as a mouthpiece for the university, Mitnick said there has been a lot of distrust with ASM in the past.Within the organization, Mitnick said some representatives are pushing back against some of ASM’s decisions to challenge the university this semester. Mitnick said he knows the system of shared governance has not worked for many populations of the student body, and ASM must use the control they have to advocate for those students.“We need to change the culture of this organization into being one that is here for students, that does not shy away from controversy, and in fact, almost welcomes it because if we are not making administrators uncomfortable … then we’re not doing our job,” Mitnick said.As a student of color at UW, Bennett said it never seemed like BIPOC students’ goals were addressed by ASM. She believes the standing precedent was for ASM to have a very close relationship with the administration, as opposed to the students they’re supposed to speak for.Bennett said actions taken by Mitnick and other members of ASM this year — notably, dissenting against the UW administration — have helped uplift BIPOC voices. Bennett said this year is the first time she has felt represented by student government. Looking forward to the organization’s future, she hopes ASM starts to challenge the university and establishes themselves as an independent entity.“I think ASM is kind of rising to the occasion now and just going against the status quo. They are kind of thinking, ‘look, the systems that are in place aren’t working out for BIPOC students,’ they aren’t,” Bennett said. “I think that through having those tough conversations, ASM itself is evolving, and people are thinking internally about those tough questions.”Mitnick said he hopes this year will mark an organizational shift for ASM amid the challenges of shared governance erosion and administrative resistance. Mitnick said he believes the organization must mobilize ways to elevate the student body’s voice through more collaborative mechanisms while simultaneously holding the administration accountable.Mitnick said he believes ASM and UW can accomplish this through establishing public comment sessions in student advisory committees and creating more Chapter 6 shared governance committees that allow students to have a direct vote on these bodies.With the willingness to challenge existing systems, Mitnick said he hopes ASM can bring grassroots organizing power back to ASM and the student body. While his current conversations with some UW administrators have shown they do not support adding public comment sections, Mitnick said ASM will continue to work toward re-establishing the student government’s representative role.“We want to use our role to challenge that and say that the status quo has not been working, the system has not been working,” Mitnick said. “So, let’s redefine what that system is.”",Sharing governance: Student leaders question UW’s representation of the student body,UWM

He is also the National Security Council’s link to the Intelligence Community, a federation that conducts intelligence activities that are necessary for foreign relations and national security.Holmgren said regardless of one’s politics, President Obama is one of the most thoughtful and respectful people he has ever met.“We should be grateful that we have a president that is so considerate and open to a wide variety of perspectives,” Holmgren said.Holmgren is also the senior director of intelligence programs at the National Security Council, where he maintains our nation’s security by overseeing policy decisions that pertain to covert programming and the creation and implementation of intelligence reforms.Primarily, Holmgren said his position is to coordinate intelligence among various government entities. Since agencies like the CIA and NSA have different values and interests, the biggest challenge of his position is to coordinate a plan that takes into account the motives of all stakeholders. In order to lay out a clear plan for the president, Holmgren weighs the costs and benefits to find a compromise among the views of many agencies.Before Holmgren solidified his place in Washington, he moved around in several positions. Holmgren started his career with the Defense Intelligence Agency then was a senior analyst at the CIA Counterterrorism Center. From the CIA, he took a position as director of counter-terrorism on the National Security Coalition staff. A few advisory roles later and he is now advising the commander-in-chief.Holmgren’s career in government has helped him receive many awards including Secretary of Defense’s Meritorious Civilian Service Award and the CIA Hostile Service Action Medal.Holmgren graduated from UW with a B.A. in journalism and political science, then went on to receive his M.A. in global security strategies from Johns Hopkins University.Holmgren said he values the foundation UW provided for his future.“Attending Wisconsin was one of the best experiences of my life,” Holmgren said. “It has provided value throughout my career in unique and unforeseen ways.”Though Holmgren started his college career strictly as a journalism major, one of the most devastating events in America’s history inspired him to get involved in our nation’s security.After the Sept. 11 attacks 15 years ago, Holmgren changed his major to include political science to be able to serve the public. He was determined make sure an attack like that never happened on American soil again.“I felt an obligation to serve the country and to give back to a country that gave so much to me,” Holmgren said.After 9/11 many universities were trying to incorporate the attacks in instruction and course material. Holmgren said UW was “ahead of the curve” because they increased courses in Arabic languages, and on terrorism and politics in the Middle East.In photos: Badgers plant flags on Bascom to remember 9/11 victims

This objective, in and of itself, is enough of a reason for many to join fraternities.The problem with this one-dimensional assessment is found on a deeper level. In an effort to remain relevant and attract more people in an age when social media has largely replaced their purpose, this rationale has been rendered tantamount. In addition to the lengths the university already goes to encourage socializing, such as sanctioning student organizations other than Greek life, as technology has increased, so have the opportunities to make friends and acquaintances.As a result, the goal of these organizations is no longer to offer a place to belong, but to establish an air of superiority and elitism. The high cost of membership, as well as the present connections that centuries-old organizations offer, contribute to this reputation.This increasing sense of superiority has also coincided with the alarming frat-related activities that have come to light in the recent months. One can search for news involving fraternities and ethics violations and find several accounts at any time. On the day of this writing, for example, the University of Florida suspended its Zeta Beta Tau chapter after its members were accused of spitting, urinating and pouring beer on wounded war veterans on Panama City Beach. The lists of offenses at other schools contain further atrocities, including recent alcohol-related deaths at Rutgers University and the University of Nebraska – Lincoln, and the revocation of UW-Milwaukee’s Tau Kappa Epsilon chapter in December after four party attendees were allegedly drugged and consequently hospitalized last fall.Many would say these events are isolated incidents; the media tends to sensationalize the stories in a way that makes them appear few and far between. But it is this very notion that makes them especially egregious. Although certain individuals have boldly spoken out against the system of institutionalized elitism, fraternities as a whole have yet to be held accountable for their actions.These claims are just as often wrongfully cloaked in the equally elitist notion that the atrocities are “just part of being in a fraternity.” There is purpose to joining fraternities, and to get a slice of the elitist pie, one must blindly subject himself to whatever offensive, distasteful activities the fraternity deems acceptable.It is possible that fraternities are pegged with a disproportionate amount of contempt when compared to other areas on college campuses where accusations of unethical behavior occur. Not all fraternities are as nefarious as the ones that make the news. Many, in fact, organize fundraisers and put forth efforts to better the community. That said, one must view the purpose of fraternities through the lens of their supposed mission when judging their activity. According to Chi Phi’s website, “Over 2,300 undergraduates and over 45,000 alumni work to instill a common set of values among worthy university men across the country and improve not only their undergraduate experience, but provide positive experiences.”The national Chi Phi organization has condemned the UW chapter’s actions, but under this logic, the “common set of values” includes the belief it is acceptable to force pledges into “positive experiences,” like situations of suggested sexual assault, being hooded for more than eight hours and confinement to a small attic. Not to mention sending text messages such as, “I just really want [the pledge in the coffin] to suffer.”Documents detail allegations over Chi Phi hazing practices
One allegation of hazing at Chi Phi was so traumatizing, it left some new members “so shaken up that they Read…These allegations that paint the sinister picture of one fraternity’s activities are enough to call into question why these actions are socially acceptable; why do many continue to condone, even encourage, such horrid, humiliating acts? The dismissal of any sense of wrongdoing is too often justified with “that’s what Greek life is.”To best maintain the validity of this point, we must ask if it was “just part of Greek life” for the pledge, whose intoxicated fraternity brother kicked him in the coffin during the ritual, giving him a concussion. Apparently it was “just part of Greek life” for frat brothers at Dartmouth College to allegedly brand a pledge. In addition, Andrew Lohse, an ex-Dartmouth frat member, released different horror stories a few years ago to Rolling Stone.Before challenging fraternities to change their ways and own their iniquities, we must ask why we hold them in high regard. There is a mystique to fraternity life that attracts many young men, but we must determine its substance. For many of these young men, the dedication to the cause is worth enduring torturous, embarrassing hazing, only to subject oneself to incidents of alcohol poisoning, sexual assault and racism on the other end. Before accepting an invitation to pledge, one must decide if the promise of friends and networking opportunities merits the most heinous of hazing rituals. As a nation, by continuing to idolize and value these institutions, which are seldom in the news for altruistic purposes, we are compromising our moral fiber.There may not be a clear answer at this time, but with any great realization comes doubt. The dark nature of fraternities is more ominous than ever, but it has been rarely discussed. It’s time to start talking about it.Kaden Greenfield (kdgreenfield@wisc.edu) is a sophomore majoring in communication arts.",Letter to the editor: Elitism of Greek life excuses atrocities,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2019/05/01/uws-student-activism-past-present-and-future/,"May 1, 2019","At the first Mifflin block party 50 years ago, University of Wisconsin students came together in protest. Even as tensions between the Madison Police Department and UW students were heightened after a tumultuous confrontation during the 1967 Dow Chemical protests just a few years earlier, the cycle of rigorous youth activism remained unbroken.For students, it was a time to dance in the streets. But for police officers, it was time to get revenge, local historian Stu Levitan said.What started as a “noise complaint” triggered a confrontation between Mifflin attendees and police in riot gear — complete with face masks, billy clubs, vests and tear gas canisters.What co-founder of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition Matthew Braunginn called the “youthful energy” and “reckless mindset” of activists became apparent at the Mifflin party-turned-protest. Young people retaliated against the police with rocks, bottles and bricks.But Braunginn added that even today where there’s progress, there’s also pushback.Students flee from police officers spreading tear gas outside the Commerce Building (now Ingraham Hall) at a protest against Dow Chemical.
Courtesy of UW ArchivesPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order in March requiring colleges to protect free speech on campus or risk losing federal research funding. The executive order was issued in response to the increasingly frequent protests of conservative speakers on college campuses, the Associated Press reported.Two years earlier, the UW System Board of Regents passed a “Commitment to Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression” policy, which strongly upholds the expectations assigned in Trump’s order.Under the policy, a student who has been found to disrupt free expression twice faces suspension. A third offense could lead to expulsion, according to the UW System protest guidelines.UW spokesperson Meredith McGlone said in an email to The Badger Herald that protesters at UW are held accountable for disrupting events or speakers, regardless of the viewpoint they express.“Our campus has long been known for free and vigorous debate — the ‘fearless sifting and winnowing by which alone the truth can be found,’ as the plaque on Bascom Hall reads,” McGlone said. “We support the right to free expression while simultaneously taking appropriate steps to keep our community safe.”However, this debate is nothing new, Levitan said.In 1965, former Republican Gov. Warren Knowles, with the support of his newly appointed Republican regents, restricted protest culture heavily, Levitan said. This includes restrictions on protest equipment and curfews — even a student convicted for a misdemeanor after obstructing university activities could be suspended for a semester.“This whole debate that we’re having today about students disrupting speakers or disrupting classes, we had this whole debate 50 years ago — and the students lost,” Levitan said.But Levitan believes activism — regardless of its consequences — follows a common progression: first protest, followed by disapproval from those in power, then resistance from the activists, next pushback and finally further escalation of the issue.EMILY HAMER/The Badger HeraldBlack activism has historically seen pushback when progress has been made, Braunginn said. One example is Reconstruction as the progress, with the prevalence of Jim Crow laws being the pushback.“It’s a constant battle, but the condition has to be really dedicated youth that are thinking beyond themselves,” Braunginn said.He added that the youthful energy arising after a failure of leadership has led to real social change, from the Civil Rights Movement to today’s fight against climate change.But even one of the most successful youth activist movements, like the Civil Rights Movement, prompted severe consequences. Students got hurt and sometimes killed, whereas today they’re more likely to face suspension or expulsion instead.This whole debate that we’re having today about students disrupting speakers or disrupting classes, we had this whole debate 50 years ago — and the students lost.
Stu Levitan, local historian“You are fighting for your right to exist as a full human being,” Braunginn said. “That consequence of being expelled versus your right to be a full human to me is not really a choice.”For Braunginn, the “urgency of now” takes precedence over danger for young people, which makes them some of the strongest activists — especially because many youth involved in activism are usually those who are oppressed, marginalized or most impacted in some way.While fighting for humanity is the real choice, Braunginn said youth activists might reconsider their tactics in response to consequences. When it comes to Young Gifted and Black, their goal is to take back power through disruptive protests in the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement.RILEY STEINBRENNER/The Badger HeraldBut while youth activists of yesterday and today face severe consequences, sometimes sustaining a movement under the weight of the university system can hinder its ability to generate change.Co-president of Students for Justice in Palestine Zahiah Hammad first joined the organization as a freshman. Two years prior, SJP members had been preparing a movement demanding the university divest from companies that contribute to human rights violations.As a freshman, Hammad and the rest of SJP joined the Black Student Union, MEChA, Wunk Sheek and other interested students in proposing a divestment resolution to the Associated Students of Madison.In just 24 hours, they were met with backlash from various student organizations on campus, as well as on social media.After revisions were made, ASM eventually voted on the resolution. This time, Hammad said, Chancellor Rebecca Blank released a statement asserting that ASM does not have the power to divest from companies the university does business with.Two years later, as SJP co-president, Hammad is working to confront these companies at a more internal level — a process that is proving to be just as difficult.“As much as we can make noise on campus and build solidarity and bring more attention to [divestment], actual action is something that is really hard to do unless you are able to change basically how the university is set up,” Hammad said.Overall, Hammad views youth activism and its ability to create lasting change in a positive light. She is inspired by the increase in youth activism today as it pertains to the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election.Similar to the lengthy process required for ASM to approve the divestment resolution, Hammad said real change resulting from activism takes time.“It’s helping create this population of people that are one day going to grow up,” Hammad said. “Hopefully that generation and that group of people are going to be the ones … to make that action that they are active about happen.”RILEY STEINBRENNER/The Badger HeraldMegan Miller, the Morgridge Center for Public Service assistant director for civic engagement and communications, said there’s a need to build a lasting commitment to civic engagement in the student bodyThe Morgridge Center utilizes a framework developed by Stanford University called the pathways of public service to foster civic engagement on campus. One of those pathways is community organizing and activism, Miller said.“What I really like about that framework is that it highlights the interdependence between these different ways of being involved in the community,” Miller said. “When we’re thinking about lasting social change, activism plays an important role in that.”Along with the other pathways — community-based research, policy and governance, philanthropy, direct service and social responsibility — Miller said lasting social change has generally involved a variety of routes as opposed to just activism.Miller added that lasting social change often takes more time than students have at UW. So, the Morgridge Center focuses on supporting long-term, existing organizations and projects by connecting students with them during their college experience.“That helps create lasting social change — helping [students] think about how their work contributes to a broader movement, or something that’s larger than their time on campus,” Miller said.At the university level, students are actively representing themselves and their own ideas too by way of ASM, ASM Chair Laura Downer said.ASM’s shared governance system is unique to most student councils in that it gives students decision-making power at the policy level, Downer said. ASM campaign-based committees are also a form of student activism, she added.“Everyone that’s involved in ASM, and especially the leadership of ASM, has a fairly active role in advocating for students directly to administrators,” Downer said. “The greatest thing I’ve learned is how to plan campaigns and how to thinking through tactics and strategies.”Are we going to let others decide our future, or are we going to grab it? Power isn’t given away, it’s taken — and we have to take our power.
Matthew Brauginn; Young, Gifted and Black Coalition spokespersonBy getting students involved from their freshman year until graduation, Downer said they are able to make sustainable, long-term decisions with the help of full-time staff.As involved as ASM is in the systemic decisions made at UW, Downer said they still face limitations. Some shared governance committees don’t receive enough respect from the departments they work with. Downer said they’re often attacked from the state level, too.Additionally, while ASM prides itself on being a nonpartisan organization, Downer added that sometimes their nonpartisan stance keeps them from addressing certain issues students feel strongly about.While ASM voted to pass the divestment resolution SJP and other student organizations brought forward, Downer — who was not involved during that time — added that this was an instance in which the issue did not fall under ASM’s institutional scope.“Being exposed to ASM but not involved in that conversation gave me a unique and healthy perspective on what the purpose of student government should be,” Downer said. “Institutional reflection on who we are and what we should do … has definitely influenced leaders.”ABBY DOEDEN/The Badger HeraldThis reflection spans across youth activists from a variety of movements — especially after the 2016 presidential election, Hammad said.For Hammad, it’s possible this recent resurgence of youth activist movements could be attributed to pushback of progress prompted by Trump’s election.Such resistance may lead to higher voter turnout and increased criticism of political candidates, Hammad added. Already, political candidates are visiting places like Madison — a so-called “liberal bubble” — because they see a new culture of activism here, Hammad said.Considering millennials are the largest voting bloc, Braunginn said the power stemming from those younger than 35 years old could entirely re-shape the nation. Unfortunately, this age group votes least often.“We are outvoted at every level, yet we wouldn’t let our grandparents decide our outfits for the day,” Braunginn said. “Why are we letting them decide our future?”For Braunginn, activism is important because potential political candidates start to pay more attention to youth voters.Hammad said she has seen an increase in youth activism at UW, and her cohorts are responding to it well.Braunginn urged youth activists — even those who are apathetic to voting — to vote, get involved in the political process and better shape the conversation.“Are we going to let others decide our future, or are we going to grab it?” Braunginn asked. “Power isn’t given away, it’s taken — and we have to take our power.”","UW’s student activism: Past, present and future",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2005/11/15/gundrum-renames-aver/,"Nov 15, 2005","Recent legislative action named for Steven Avery, who was wrongly convicted for and later exonerated of a crime he did not commit, will be renamed following Avery's implication as the prime suspect in the murder of a young Hilbert, Wis., woman, a state representative said Monday.Though formal charges are likely to come today in the homicide of Teresa Halbach, questions surrounding Avery's involvement in Halbach's murder have caused a key creator of the ""Avery Task Force"" bill to change its moniker to the ""Criminal Justice Reform Package.""""In order to be sensitive to the present circumstances and certainly the Halbach family, I believe it would be inappropriate to continue referring to it in any way by the name of Steven Avery,"" said State Rep. Mark Gundrum, R-New Berlin.Halbach, 25, was last seen Oct. 31, and her body was found Thursday on property owned by Avery's family. A search of the property revealed several key pieces of evidence that police said incriminate Avery, including Avery's blood found in Halbach's SUV and a DNA sample matching Avery's that was found on the ignition key of the vehicle — a key found in Avery's trailer.""[Avery's actions] are so incredibly disturbing,"" Gundrum said. ""I am so deeply sorry for what has befallen Teresa Halbach and her family.""Gundrum was instrumental in creating the Avery Task Force, and co-authored legislation instituting proposed changes in state law stemming from the task force. However, he added the intention of the bill relates to statewide criminal justice reform and is not isolated to the Avery case.""It was really just an occasion and opportunity to get together criminal justice professionals from all perspectives — prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, police officers, sheriffs, et cetera — to discuss what kind of reforms we should be making to improve our justice system even more,"" Gundrum said.The DNA technology, which Calumet county officials said points to Avery's guilt in the Halbach murder, was what cleared his name in the 1985 conviction.The Avery Task Force was formed after DNA analysis of evidence from the case exonerated Avery in 2003 after he served 18 years in prison for crimes of attempted murder and sexual assault.Though the task force completed its objectives six months ago, the legislation was termed the ""Avery Task Force,"" and the bill still awaits Gov. Doyle's signature before it can become law. However, the bill will be written into statutes as the ""Criminal Justice Reform Package"" upon receiving Doyle's anticipated approval.Some provisions of the legislation would require electronic recording of police interrogations, updating of eye-witness identification procedures and reforming the state's use of DNA technology to ensure wrongful convictions, like in the 1985 Avery case, do not occur in Wisconsin.Keith Findley, a University of Wisconsin law professor and co-director of the Wisconsin Innocence Project, which helped free Avery in 2003, said the faults of the state's eyewitness identification system was a major factor in Avery's past conviction.""[S]ingle eyewitness identification … is one most common contributing factors in wrongful convictions,"" Findley said.The controversy surrounding Avery should not have a negative effect on the Wisconsin Innocence Project, Findley said; the project has helped free several other people mistakenly imprisoned in the state.""Whatever happens with Steven Avery's case now does not change the fact that he was wrongly convicted in that prior case,"" Findley said. ""And it remains whether he is guilty or not [in the Halbach case], he will be tried and that will be determined.""The former Avery Task Force bill was unanimously passed in the State Assembly in September and in the State Senate in October.However, Halbach's murder and the changing of the legislation's name do not take away from the necessity of the bill, Gundrum said.""These are important reforms — it was two years of very valuable work with some of the most knowledgeable and experienced law enforcement professionals in the state,"" Gundrum said. ""It was a very worthwhile product that improves criminal justice in the entire state.""Findley echoed Gundrum's sentiment concerning needed improvements to the state's criminal justice system.""But regardless of whether [Avery] is guilty or not, it remains vitally important for us to ensure that the criminal justice system convicts the guilty and not the innocent — that it's as reliable as it can be and truth is the paramount objective,"" Findley said.",Gundrum renames Avery bill,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2019/02/05/native-american-students-experience-difficulty-transitioning-to-campus-lack-uw-support/,"Feb 5, 2019","As of fall 2018, 575 students attending the University of Wisconsin identify as Native American, according to the Office of the Registrar enrollment reports. Those students range from undergraduates to graduate and professional students enrolled in a variety of majors and programs.There are a variety of student organizations for Native students, and the American Indian Studies department was established in 1972 to “coor­di­nate the devel­op­ment of Native Amer­i­can Stud­ies courses and recruit­ment of Amer­i­can Indian fac­ulty,” according to the AIS website. Despite the apparent efforts by the university to support Native students and faculty on campus, many students still report difficulties navigating a predominately white campus, UW law professor Richard Monette said. Monette teaches Native American law courses at UW and works as the director of the Great Lakes Indian Law Center. He works with both Native American students on campus and Native people off campus, offering both legal assistance and other types of support to tribes and organizations across Wisconsin.Several factors, he said, can make the transition difficult for Native students, from small-scale things like differences in food or language, to larger, abstract issues.“It’s difficult for them to come from a place where they have learned a different worldview — granted still in a difficult context — but to come here and not find that worldview, not find that worldview being welcomed or understood is very difficult,” Monette said.Monette discussed some of UW’s attempts at easing the transition, though he said that resources and support networks for students are almost all student directed and led.He cited the Amer­i­can Indian Stu­dent and Cul­tural Cen­ter, which is an off campus facility housing several student groups and other resources. It provides a safe space for students to connect with their culture in ways that they may not be able to do in the dorms — for instance, smudging or drumming.In 2016, students were shouting and ridiculing Native American students a fire circle at Dejope Hall, Monette said. AISCC provides a space separate from the often-negative campus climate.But Monette also mentioned that because the AISCC is in the path of a university construction project, they will have to vacate it. This, along with little things — like the libraries categorizing Native books as “history” and invalidating the current experiences of students on campus — only exacerbate the difficult transition.He said creating a system to connect students with certain Native-centered projects could be beneficial, but right now UW is a “little too disorganized.”“We have a lot of places on our campus that deal with the native nations here,” Monette said. “It’s disorganized, it’s not uniform, it’s not streamlined, not centralized, very poor communication back and forth. So instead of extracting all the good from that, this ends up causing even more problems at times.”Panel discusses UW’s shortfalls in supporting indigenous students
The Alpha Pi Omega sorority held a panel of indigenous alumni Thursday to hear about the Native American experience on Read…For some Native students, the difficulty can mount into mental health problems, or worsen already existent mental health conditions. That was the case for Isabel Denning. A member of the Oneida Nation and a sophomore at UW in 2016, Isabel Denning committed suicide after mounting trauma, financial difficulties and her mental health conditions became too much to handle.Isabel Denning’s father, Mark Denning, said she had sought treatment with University Health Services after her older brother had committed suicide and she’d experienced multiple sexual assaults. She’d dealt with bipolar disorder and anxiety as well.But cultural differences and miscommunication had led UHS to drop her. Denning said that after visiting several different professionals and hospitals, she became an “unreliable narrator” to her own condition, unable to find the right resources.“Madison let her in,” Denning said. “They recruited her, and they let her in. Is that the end of the responsibility? As a parent, at her orientation, I was told to leave her alone. To let her mature. And during that maturation, there was also a maturation of mental illness, and that created isolation.”Isabel Denning’s boyfriend at the time she’d committed suicide, Andrew Gray, said part of her difficulty adjusting to campus came from her peers’ inability to understand her identity as a native person.People would ask her questions like “what are you?” referring to her ethnic or cultural identity without realizing the harmful connotation. Gray said asking a multicultural person that question forces them to package themselves into something simplified, while also invalidating their existence as multiethnic.While perhaps something small, remarks like those only reminded Denning that she didn’t look like the other — mostly white — students on campus, Gray said.Gray suggested that UW could help, perhaps with a course in cultural literacy as part of orientation, but he also said that one of the best ways non-native students could support their native peers is to open lines of communication with them.“You gotta ask questions, and you gotta acknowledge your whiteness, to an extent,” Gray said. “Things that you take for granted, or you make assumptions about don’t universally apply to others. The cultural and racial differences are always there, and you’ve gotta be willing to ask questions in a way that isn’t loaded or judgemental.”Feelings of displacement among Native Americans extends to campus
Displacement has characterized the Native American experience for hundreds of years. This threat extends beyond the reservation, however, as University Read…Denning also said that one of the biggest issues UW had was “overmatched” advisors. Not only does each advisor have tons of students to support, but not every one has the cultural sensitivity that would help them to support their native students in productive ways.In the end, Monette said that the biggest issue with the campus is the climate. Right now, it trends negatively for native students. The only way to help native students transition safely to UW is to create a positive campus climate. And that’s not just a job for the administration, but also for the students, Monette said.“What is and will be productive is to build a positive campus climate, and we don’t have that yet,” Monette said.For students experiencing mental health difficulties and/or crises, there are support networks available. The following are crisis hotlines, though their websites can help connect people with other forms of support.National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255National Alliance on Mental Health: 1-800-950-6264Journey Mental Health Services (Dane County Hotline): 608-280-2600","Native American students experience difficulty transitioning to campus, lack UW support",UWM

Main Street, has recently drawn attention due to the arrests of two of its owners and an employee.[/media-credit]Police have arrested an employee of a downtown massage parlor for the second time since they began investigating the location for alleged prostitution last month.Madison police arrested an unidentified woman who was an employee of the Rising Sun massage parlor on West Main Street, near Capitol Square, on 10 charges of prostitution over the weekend. She also faces counts of bail jumping for allegedly committing the prostitution offenses while on bail for a different incident where she reportedly left her daughter with a pedophile. MPD declined to comment further on the arrest at press time.On Oct. 20, MPD raided the massage parlor in connection with an investigation about the sexual assault of a 9-year-old Madison girl. Not long after the raid, police arrested the parlor’s owner, Charles Prindiville, in Middleton on illegal weapons charges.Employees at Rising Sun declined interview requests from The Badger Herald, citing a “no soliciting” policy. However, the establishment continued to operate, offering massages as of Sunday evening.Businesses near the Rising Sun also declined to comment on the developments. Ald. Mike Verveer, District 4, said he has never communicated with the owners of Rising Sun throughout his entire tenure on the City Council, despite its prominent location less than a block from the Capitol. He added he has never received any complaints for downtown residents about the establishment.Verveer said he was surprised to hear Rising Sun was still operating since he believed they would have shut their doors after MPD’s investigation last month. He also said he does not recall any prostitution charges being filed against any Rising Sun employees.“I had assumed that the police had had taken away so much of their stuff…and that the owner would realize that there’s an active criminal investigation,” Verveer said.MPD have previously said prostitution downtown has decreased since the 1970s and relocated to the online sex for sale industry. In 2007, police arrested 12 men for participating in a prostitution ring on Badger Road on the city’s south side.“When people think of prostitution, they think of ladies of the night standing on the street corner and johns circling the block over and over,” Verveer said. “As far as I know there were never really any complaints about the Rising Sun because it was behind closed doors on a commercial block.”– The Associated Press contributed to this report.",Massage parlor employee arrested for prostitution,UWM

It is in these 400 buildings that students live, study, work, rehearse, research. And it is in these buildings that students, inevitably, use the bathroom.Aside from their obvious functions, bathrooms also serve as a place to collect yourself prior to an exam, a place to reapply makeup or fix your hair, a place to splash water on your face during an all-night study session or a place to change clothes after a shift at work.For students and faculty who are cisgender, or someone who exclusively identifies as their sex assigned at birth, restrooms are a second thought — access and availability are guaranteed. For transgender or gender non-conforming students, both access and availability — as well as feelings of safety in the bathroom — are not promised.A transgender person is one whose gender identity or expression is not aligned with the gender they were assigned at birth, while a gender non-conforming person is one whose gender expression differs from stereotypical expectations of the gender.Of the 400 buildings on campus, approximately 60 have gender-neutral bathrooms. Typically, these are single-stall, locking facilities and are often far from the unisex bathrooms. Instead, they are found on separate floors, in the basement or in other less accessible spots in a building.“Something I would ask every cisgender student is to make a list of how many gender-neutral bathrooms they can think of on campus. The list would be kind of short.”
Rena Yehuda Newman, UW JuniorThe Red Gym has three main floors, with only an old, slow elevator connecting them. On a good day, the elevator takes about two minutes to meander between floors. On a bad day, two minutes seems like the blink of an eye. While there are bathrooms on each floor, the only gender-neutral restroom is tucked away in a back corner of the first floor.Compared to many buildings on campus that lack even one gender-neutral bathroom, the Red Gym is an improvement. But the existence of a single gender-neutral bathroom does not immediately signal equal accessibility.A person looking to use this bathroom must jump through hoops to use the restroom — in this case, the hoops being a slow elevator and a trek through the halls of the Red Gym — that people who use gender-specific bathrooms do not have to jump through.UW campus climate report reveals minority students have less positive experiences than majority students
The University of Wisconsin released its first campus climate report Wednesday, in which it detailed the results of a survey examining Read…In Wisconsin, hoops such as Assembly Bill 469 require public school bathrooms to be designated for exclusive use of students of one sex only. But the bill includes a clause allowing for a school board to provide reasonable accommodations for transgender students who wish to use a single-occupancy restroom.In 2018, the Madison public school district pledged to include all-gender bathrooms in every public school. The school district also ended the practice of keeping the single-stall bathrooms locked, requiring students who wanted to use one to obtain the key from the front office. This effort is meant to normalize the use of the single-stall restrooms by any student, not just transgender students.Though the Madison public school district’s pledge is promising for a more LGBTQ+-inclusive environment in K-12 schools, a study by UW communication arts professor Sara McKinnon and Maurice Gattis of University of Louisville found that there appears to be a disconnect between existing policies intended to protect transgender students and the knowledge of said policies among school employees and administrators.“Even a lot of really well-intentioned educators have had to go through their own education about what it means to be a transgender or non-binary student,” Brian Juchems, co-director of the Gay-Straight Alliance for Safe Schools said.McKinnon and Gattis interviewed 21 transgender and gender non-conforming students from Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay and Racine in what has been heralded as a “groundbreaking study” by transgender advocates for its level of detail and specificity.Alongside this disconnect, the study found that a lack of access to gender-neutral or appropriate bathrooms and locker rooms remains a large problem in Wisconsin schools.As Madison public schools have turned their attention to creating more inclusive environments for LGBTQ+ students, in part with new and improved bathroom usage policies and the inclusion of gender-neutral restrooms, so too has the focus shifted on the UW campus.University administrator said UW ‘looking into’ developing gender-inclusive bathrooms
In a panel Thursday, university leaders said they will continue to work to improve the healthcare and experiences of LGBTQ+ Read…In response to the Trump administration’s policy change regarding protections of transgender students under Title IX in 2017, UW Chancellor Rebecca Blank co-penned a letter with university officials from Rutgers University and Princeton University to U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos expressing concern with the rollback of federal protections for transgender students on university campuses.In addition to the letter, Blank issued a statement in support of the LGBTQ+ members of the UW community, in which the university administration wrote that “UW Madison welcomes, values and supports students, faculty and staff of all gender identities, including transgender, gender non-conforming, intersex and non-binary individuals.”The university statement also outlined current efforts to make campus more safe, equal and inclusive for LGBTQ students.Part of this effort has been the creation of a campus map, complete with documentation of known gender-neutral and ADA-accessible bathrooms.Renaming of Gender and Sexuality Campus Center step forward for campus inclusivity

Though almost 400 buildings comprise campus, there are only around 60 that have at least one gender-neutral bathroom.“We don’t have an actual number of [gender-neutral bathrooms] on campus, but there are buildings that we know [have them]. And we know that this [number] isn’t going to be complete, because it’s crowd-sourced,” Katherine Charek Briggs, assistant director of the Gender and Sexuality Campus Center, said.Rena Yehuda Newman is a junior at UW, and identifies as non-binary. They believe 60 gender-neutral bathrooms on campus is far too few, especially when it comes to fostering an environment conducive to learning and studying in campus buildings.“I identify as non-binary, which means I’m neither a man nor a woman,” Newman said. “That ends up meaning that entering into gendered bathrooms on a personal level is uncomfortable and on a social level can expose me to harassment and violence. In general, the majority of campus buildings that are for classes are not fitted with gender-neutral bathrooms, including the more modern ones. The SoHE building’s bathrooms are really funky — they have bird noises in them — which would be cool if they were accessible.”As someone who is studying history, Newman spends countless hours in the George L. Mosse Humanities Building.For Newman, the building some students refer to only semi-jokingly as “riot-proof” and freshmen regard as immensely confusing is inaccessible for a different reason: There’s only one gender-neutral bathroom in the entire building.“There’s only one gender-neutral bathroom, and that bathroom is located inside the history department office and is not advertised,” Newman said. “So if I wanted to go to the restroom and I couldn’t use the one in the history office, that would mean I would have to physically leave the building, go to the Elvehjem building or Memorial Union.”Not only are campus buildings largely inaccessible to transgender and non-binary students, University Housing creates another hoop for these individuals to jump through.According to University Housing policy, bathrooms may be designated as single or mixed-gender facilities within residence halls.“Individuals should use bathrooms that correspond to their sex or gender identity, depending on which option they feel is safer, or utilize bathrooms that are designated gender-neutral/gender-inclusive,” the policy reads.Brendon Dybdahl, a spokesperson with University Housing, reiterated this sentiment, adding that the housing assignment office works closely with students who contact them with questions regarding living in residence halls as LGBTQ+ individuals.“We work to assign these students to an environment that will be comfortable for them,” Dybdahl said. “Students can be assigned by their identified gender rather than their biological gender if they prefer. Bathrooms on most resident floors are gender-specific. Trans students are encouraged to use the bathroom that is most comfortable for them.”Dybdahl also highlighted newly constructed and renovated buildings in which gender-inclusive bathrooms have been added. Dejope, Leopold, Ogg and Smith residence halls all have separate gender-inclusive full bathrooms on each floor. Renovation plans for Witte Residence Hall, scheduled to be completed in August 2019, also include one gender-neutral full bathroom per floor.While newly built or renovated residence halls are constructed to include gender-neutral bathrooms, Dybdahl said the older buildings or buildings that have not been renovated oftentimes only have gender-specific bathrooms on each floor.Progress toward a more inclusive and safe campus community has been slow moving.In spring 2017, the Committee for LGBTQ People in the University developed a two-phase project which aims to create appropriate signage for bathrooms and craft a usage policy for gendered restrooms.“[The policy came out of a] shared governance body … a taskforce from each of the four governance groups on campus: faculty, academic staff, university staff and students. I believe right now it’s kind of sitting in facilities planning and management, and they’ll be looking at logistics because they’re the ones that manage the buildings and renovations,” Kelly Krien, assistant staff director of the Associated Students of Madison, said.To realize phase one of the project — providing appropriate signage for already existing bathrooms on campus — the manager of the building in question must be on board with the required space study. This normally requires the support of an administrator or high-ranking official in the building.But it is nearly impossible for individual students to request a space study.“What [the request] is essentially saying is, ‘If you do the space study and the study says that you’ll need to do construction, you’re committing money to that project,’” Briggs said. “So an individual student could not submit that request.”Once a request is made, the space study itself has two phases. The first is a fixtures study, and is conducted by looking through old building blueprints, finding the restrooms, and counting every toilet, urinal and sink in each one, and how each is labeled.“It is not easy,” Briggs said. “It takes forever.”The second stage of the space study is called the occupancy study, which involves estimating how many people could use a particular building by counting the number of chairs and categorizing rooms by function.“They use the fixture and occupancy studies and mash them together, and see if you’re allowed to take these other restrooms offline [and change their signage],” Briggs said.“If a building chooses to relabel bathrooms as gender-neutral, those bathrooms become “offline” and, if the relabeling results in the total number of gender-specific restrooms falling below the number required by the international building code, the building is no longer up to code.”These studies are not only time-consuming but also incredibly costly.UW administration approved funding for the committee to hire outside agencies to conduct the space and occupancy studies for 50 of the 400 buildings on campus, but Briggs said funding ran out after just 32.“It falls upon the department [to fund studies and update bathrooms], and this sets us up for a situation of the ‘have versus have-nots,’” Krien said. “The departments that can afford it are able to do these upgrades and renovations, but not all departments have that funding available.”In addition to funding, departments or buildings wishing to update bathrooms must ensure that any renovations or construction meets the requirements of the international building code.The international building code stipulates how many gender-specific bathrooms a building must have after considering its maximum occupancy. In other words, buildings do not have an incentive to include gender-neutral bathrooms because they do not count toward the overall bathroom total needed to meet code.If a building chooses to relabel bathrooms as gender-neutral, those bathrooms become “offline” and, if the relabeling results in the total number of gender-specific restrooms falling below the number required by the international building code, the building is no longer up to code.“I think the largest challenge through this process has just been logistical, it’s been a big learning curve,” Krien said. “There are international building codes and restrictions as far as what people cannot actually do in buildings. The fact that there’s hundreds of buildings on campus and nobody quite knows where the restrooms are [also makes it difficult].”While the shared-governance committee is working on a usage policy, the second stage of the project proposed last spring, the policy remains in draft form. It is unclear when the policy will be approved.“Advocates on the shared governance committee would like to see the policy approved as quickly as possible. This work should have been done a long time ago,” Briggs said. “We’re excited to get it rolling from the place we are, and, remembering that there are a lot of campuses who benchmarked this a long time ago, we know it’s the responsible thing to do.”Proposal for non-gendered bathrooms in Union South is moving forward, UW panel says
A panel of experts gave updates Thursday on the second phase of a renovation process that will create gender-neutral bathrooms Read…With policies and renovations stalled by a lack of funding, building codes and university bureaucracy, Newman laments what they characterized as lackluster attempts at reform.“I’ve seen sort of half-hearted gestures … making new restrooms or saying renovations are coming. We’re spending millions of dollars renovating sports facilities,” Newman said. “I just want a place I can go to the bathroom regularly, it’s not really that much to ask. So frankly, I think that hypothetically it’s something the administration says it cares about. I think if they were serious about it, there would have been changes made a long time ago.”Critics of gender-neutral bathrooms nationwide often bemoan the perceived safety hazards of allowing transgender or non-binary individuals to use the bathroom of their choice.Newman argued that this critique ignores the reality of the situation: these individuals just want to use the restroom.“People who are cisgender critics of creating multi-stall gender-neutral bathrooms will say, ‘Well it might be less safe for people,’” Newman said. “There are sort of two ways I address that: one, there are a lot of other public spaces in which people of all genders are interacting. It also ignores the reality of same-gender violence that occurs in single-gender restrooms as well.”Gender-neutral bathrooms, whether single stall or multi-stall, benefit everyone on campus and in the community. In a study conducted by Rutgers University, gender-neutral bathrooms were found to make other minority groups feel safer and more included at their organization, signaling fairness across identity dimensions.Gender-neutral bathrooms also communicate to transgender and gender non-binary students and individuals they are welcome on campus.“When we talk about what kind of impact that has on the psyche of a student, in terms of the physical institution and structures they’re exposed to each day telling them whether or not they feel welcome, institutional cultures and physical spaces really do have a lot to tell us about whether or not a student is wanted,” Newman said.Released in 2017, the campus climate survey recorded student’s answers to numerous questions evaluating UW. The survey revealed that just 35 percent of transgender and non-binary students felt they belong on campus, compared to a 69 percent overall rate.Fifty-five percent of transgender and non-binary students reported feeling safe on campus, compared to a 78 percent overall rate.Thirty-three percent of transgender and non-binary students report experiencing incidents of hostile, harassing or intimidating behavior directed at them personally, compared to an 11 percent overall rate.While numerous factors affect the overwhelmingly less positive responses recorded for transgender and non-binary students, Briggs identified two as particularly prominent.“The reason I think there’s such a disparity … is that trans and non-binary students are met by both a social impact and a facilities impact. Not only are there social challenges in the classroom and with people on the street and being misgendered, but there’s all the facility pieces where if you don’t have somewhere to live you can’t be on campus, if you don’t have somewhere to use the restroom you can’t healthily be on campus,” Briggs said.Gender-neutral bathrooms are also heralded as part of universal design, meaning that a building or an environment is constructed so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of their identity, age, size, ability or disability.Campus group holds open discussion about prevalence of whiteness in LGBTQ+ spaces
The University of Wisconsin LGBT Campus Center held a discussion Wednesday night on whiteness in LGBTQ+ spaces and its impact Read…A large part of universal design, Briggs explained, is redundancy, or having a variety of ways to access facilities where everyone feels safe and comfortable in all buildings.“Right now, there’s a disparity in who gets access to [facilities],” Briggs said. “So it could be folks with mobility devices, folks who are caretakers or have children, folks who need to change clothes … there’s a whole number of reasons why single-stall locking bathrooms meet the needs of different people.”For the majority of cisgender students at UW, access to bathrooms is not the first thing that crosses their mind when entering a building for class or when choosing a residence hall freshman year. It probably doesn’t even make the top ten.But everyone needs to go to the bathroom, and without consistent access to appropriate facilities, this becomes far more challenging.As UW continues to work toward approving a usage policy and finding funding for renovations to work around the prohibitive international building code, transgender and non-binary individuals are left without consistency in access to appropriate facilities campus-wide.“Something I would ask every cisgender student is to make a list of how many gender-neutral bathrooms they can think of on campus,” Newman said. “The list would be kind of short.”","Lack of visibility surrounding gender-neutral bathrooms on campus punctuated by lack of safe space for transgender, non-binary students",UWM

If the match is incompatible, the person can usually say no to marrying them, Mohan said.“American media especially makes it look like you meet them on the day of the wedding,” Mohan said. “But that’s not true at all.”",Students explore differences in personal dating experiences from around the globe,UWM

It appears with their latest, A Head Full of Dreams, they are ready to undergo a peaceful transition of power in lieu of a Superbowl performance.Viva la Vida allowed Coldplay to practically rule the world as the protagonist in their chart-busting namesake song used to. Their two following albums — the conceptual Mylo Xyloto and acoustic Ghost Stories — were also successful in their own right.More than drugs and drops: EDM’s virtues overshadowed by misconceptions
EDM as a genre and a culture has earned the same recognition as any other category of music, and its Read…They failed, however, at the nearly impossible task to captivate the entire globe in the way that they did with Viva la Vida, Or Death and All His Friends.One could also argue though that what Mylo Xyloto and Ghost Stories lacked in mainstream influence was made up for by Chris Martin and his fellow bandmates’ artistic intent.In both albums, Coldplay imposed upon themselves artistic constraints, which allowed each album to take on greater meaning as pieces of art. The former contained a narrative about an Orwellian society, and the latter had a stripped-down sound that rewarded a more careful listening than albums prior.What is notably absent from the band’s latest album is this sense of either attempt at world domination present in Viva la Vida, or the artistic restraint in Mylo Xyloto and Ghost Stories. Instead, the album has a very loose, joyous feel. It is pleasant rather than passionate in most parts, and while it may not captivate the listener to start training for a half-marathon, it will most likely bring a smile to one’s face.This would make sense considering the band itself and many media outlets have alluded to A Head Full of Dreams being the band’s last album. As a result, it has a “victory-lap feel;” the band’s members are simply enjoying making music together for what could be the last time.Adele’s ’25’ belts predictable, but satisfying ‘hello’ to faithful fans

These shining tracks, and one or two other solid ones, are interrupted through a few stretches of bad, but not terrible songs, such as “Hymm for the Weekend,” “Army of Fun” and “Up and Up.” These tracks perhaps reflect the toll the band’s dominance has inflicted upon them as they appear bland and uninspired.  It is worth noting, however, that despite the dip in quality, these songs still maintain the loose, fun feel. As a result, it is difficult to criticize a band when they are just trying to have fun after such a successful run.Attributing sexual assault at concerts to victims’ behavior is to diminish their equal opportunity rights

https://badgerherald.com/features/2020/02/11/an-axe-to-grind/,"Feb 11, 2020","The University of Wisconsin and the University of Minnesota have perhaps the most storied rivalry in college sports, as the “Border Battle” has spanned football, hockey and anything in-between.When Wisconsin took to the gridiron against Minnesota for the first time in Nov. 1890, the Badgers suffered what remains their largest loss in school history, a 63–0 drubbing from the Golden Gophers in football.The game also represented the birth of one of the greatest sports rivalries ever, one which has now spanned 129 games across 129 years — the most-played rivalry in Football Bowl Subdivision history.While Minnesota dominated most of the matchups in the early years of the rivalry, Wisconsin has been the dominant team for the past few decades, winning 21 of the last 25 matchups dating back to the 1995 season.Wisconsin’s 21-4 record in those games has brought the all-time series to a near deadlock, with Minnesota standing at a narrow 61-60-8 advantage. In the most recent matchup, No. 13 Wisconsin bested No. 9 Minnesota in a snow-filled game which decided the Big Ten West champion by a score of 38–17.Anna Walters/The Badger HeraldFuture Badger and current Lakeville, Minnesota resident Riley Mahlman, a 4-star offensive tackle in the class of 2021, chose Wisconsin over Minnesota despite standing as the No. 1 recruit in the state and being heavily recruited by the Gophers scouting team.“I chose Wisconsin because it was the right fit for me,” Mahlman said. “It was the best fit for me personally for my academic and athletic goals. They both had a role in my decision and I was just blessed that Wisconsin is top notch in both education and athletics.”Beyond the FieldMahlman added that though the rivalry started to lose excitement during the stretch of 14 consecutive wins by the Badgers between 2004 and 2017, the win by Minnesota at Camp Randall in 2018 and the win by Wisconsin at TCF Bank Stadium in 2019 have brought buzz back to the rivalry.Despite the fact that football is undoubtedly the most popular rivalry matchup between the two schools, other sports have thrown their names into the ring of contention for that title.As close neighbors of Canada, both Wisconsin and Minnesota have a long history of college hockey, with Minnesota forming a men’s hockey team in 1895 before the University of Wisconsin men’s hockey team formed in 1921. Minnesota has won the all-time series between the two teams with a 174-96-24 record across 294 games.In recent years, Minnesota has continued to grow their advantage in the series, including a 3-0-1 record this season that featured two wins at the Kohl Center. However, both teams have struggled over the course of the late 2010s, with only two combined NCAA Tournament appearances since the 2014-2015 season.Despite their struggles, both teams have seen their share of success over the course of history.Minnesota has five National Championships, their last coming in 2003. They have also made 12 total appearances in the Frozen Four with an appearance as recently as 2014.In addition to their success as a team, Minnesota has totaled 110 players who have gone on to appear in the NHL, with 14 current players previously drafted and set to appear in the NHL in seasons to come.In the case of Wisconsin, the Badgers have totaled six National Championships, their last coming in 2006. They have also totaled nine appearances in the Frozen Four, most recently in 2010.Wisconsin has 84 former players who have gone on to appear in the NHL, with 12 current players previously drafted by NHL teams. That number includes 2019 No. 5 overall pick Alex Turcotte and 2019 No. 15 overall pick Cole Caufield, the two star freshmen on the team.Wisconsin and Minnesota also have their share of nationwide glory, as they sit as the No. 5 and No. 1 teams all-time for players on the US Men’s Olympic Team, respectively.In fact, the 1980 “Miracle on Ice” US Men’s Olympic Hockey Team that upset the Soviet Union and Finland en route to a gold medal featured eight former Minnesota Gophers and two former Wisconsin Badgers, including current Wisconsin women’s hockey head coach Mark Johnson.Familial tiesThe Border Battle between Wisconsin and Minnesota hits close to home for many, especially those who cross state lines for college. This relationship stretches across family members, particularly parents with conflicting interests.One example of that is Andy Doeden, a lifelong Minnesota native who attended UMN and is the parent of a current UW student. Doeden’s conflicting interest between family and pride is a common one that stretches across both states.“I was happy for [my daughter] as it was the right fit for her,” Doeden said. “I wanted her to stay closer to home but knew Wisconsin was right for her. I cheer for Minnesota more, but do find myself rooting for Wisconsin when they are not playing Minnesota, regardless of the sport.”Not all Minnesotans-turned-Badgers suffer from this conflict of interest, however.Kate Magnuson, another parent from Minnesota, is the proud mother of a current UW student — but she has no problem cheering for the Badgers, considering her husband is a UW alumni and the family has no direct relation to UMN.“Since I am not originally from Minnesota and have a UW student, I cheer for Wisconsin when they are not playing each other,” Magnuson said. “This year with Minnesota finally doing well in football I found myself cheering for Minnesota.”The familial relationships between Wisconsin and Minnesota cross directly into the lives of athletes, too.Wisconsin women’s hockey defensewoman Grace Bowlby is a Minnesota native herself, but she was raised as a Badger fan. But, like Mahlman, she chose Wisconsin not only for their athletics, but also for the academics that the school offers.“My father went to UW-Madison, so I’ve been a Badger fan for as long as I can remember,” Bowlby said. “Despite being a fan, the academic opportunities offered at UW-Madison, especially in the School of Business, were the best fit for me, as I highly value my education.”Leading ladiesBowlby is also a part of one of the best rivalries in all of college sports — the Wisconsin-Minnesota women’s hockey rivalry.Despite not even having a team until the 1999-2000 season, Wisconsin has been perhaps the most dominant team in the sport for the last 20 seasons, with Minnesota being one of the few teams that can contend for that title.As mentioned before, head coach Mark Johnson is a UW alumnus who went on to play professionally in the NHL and the Olympics. He took over as coach of the team for the 2002-2003 season and he has led the team to a 520-90-44 record as of Feb. 11, a career spanning 17 seasons.During Johnson’s 17 years at the helm, the Badgers have qualified for 13 NCAA Tournaments, including every season since 2013-2014. Wisconsin has also won five championships and appeared in 12 Frozen Fours under Johnson.Minnesota has been similarly dominant since their first season in 1997-1998. The Gophers have won seven championships and appeared in 13 Frozen Fours across their 22 seasons.When looking at head-to-head results, the Gophers again hold the advantage with a 52-41-12 record all-time. Like football, however, the Badgers have been the better team in recent years, going 6-2-1 across the last two seasons — including postseason — with a 2-1-1 record in the 2019-2020 season.The Border Battle has stretched into postseason play as well, with the Badgers and Gophers battling it out nine times in NCAA Tournament play. This included a meeting in the championship on three separate occasions, most recently last March when the Badgers bested Minnesota 2–0 to claim the title.Right now, the Border Battle in women’s hockey might be the most exciting rivalry in sports, with Wisconsin ranked No. 2 and Minnesota ranked No. 4 nationally, making a rematch in the NCAA Championship all the more likely come March.Like women’s hockey, women’s volleyball has seen a similar rise in popularity and achievements at both Wisconsin and Minnesota in recent years.Coming off a tough loss to Illinois in the 2018 Elite Eight, the Badgers started off 2019 with a disappointing 4-4 start. From that point on, the Badgers turned their play around, rattling off 12 consecutive wins en route to a 27-7 record and a spot in the NCAA Championship Game.Minnesota had a similarly strong season, going 27-6 on their way to a spot in the Final Four before falling to Stanford.Historically, both teams have been impressive, with Minnesota boasting six Final Four appearances and Wisconsin sitting at three Final Four appearances following their 2019 run.As they are in most other sports, Minnesota volleyball has been the better team historically against Wisconsin, sporting an 18-4 record across the last 11 seasons. However, Wisconsin altered the script slightly in 2019, winning both regular season matchups, their first time beating Minnesota since 2014.Crossing state linesWisconsin’s success across athletic disciplines has bled over to another sport — men’s basketball.Perhaps unsurprisingly, Minnesota once again holds the historical advantage at 68-56 in a rivalry that dates back to at least the 1949-1950 season. Since the 1998-1999 season, the Badgers have been the dominant team, going 29-9, including 18-2 at the Kohl Center, which opened its doors the same year.The Badgers have also snatched numerous Minnesota natives from the state, including five current players in Brad Davison, Joe Hedstrom, Walt McGrory, Nate Reuvers and Tyler Wahl.Davison explained that while he grew up a Gopher fan, he knew that Wisconsin was where he belonged.“I grew up a Gopher fan. My family had season tickets to the games,” Davison said. “That being said, Wisconsin was always one of my dream schools growing up. I fell in love with the campus, the coaches and the players. Felt like home right from the start. Most of my decision had to do with the people that make up the basketball program.”UW is known to recruit heavily from the Midwest, but Minnesota is perhaps the school’s favorite state to recruit in besides Wisconsin. Besides the five current basketball players from Minnesota, Wisconsin has recently recruited big-name athletes for future Badger teams.For football, the Badgers rank No. 25 nationally for 2020, including the recruitment of the No. 1 player from Minnesota in both the 2020 class (4-star outside linebacker Kaden Johnson) and the 2021 class (Mahlman). For basketball, the Badgers recruited 4-star Ben Carlson and 3-star Steven Crowl as part of their 2020 recruitment class.Minnesota’s recruitment class for football ranks No. 37 nationally for 2020, as P.J. Fleck continues to build his legacy at Minnesota. The pursuits of Minnesota’s basketball recruiting has similarly gone well, as they signed 4-star Jamal Mashburn Jr. in the 2020 class, adding fuel to the fire that is the Border Battle.Davison expressed excitement for the future of the Border Battle rivalry as both schools have increased their competitive levels in recent years.“Both programs have been fortunate to have great players and coaches over the last few years,” Davison said. “That is what makes the rivalry competitive. I’m thankful to be a part of it.”As the Wisconsin-Minnesota rivalry moves into another decade, the Badgers and Gophers might be more evenly matched than ever before. Despite leading in just about every sport historically, Minnesota has fallen off over the last few decades as Wisconsin has taken advantage as an elite athletic program under athletic director Barry Alvarez.The Badgers are winning this academic year’s Border Battle by a margin of 255–105 with a total of 880 points at stake, meaning spring sports will provide plenty of excitement as the Badgers attempt to hang on to their lead and earn the victory for the first time since 2016-2017.The Border Battle records across all sports have been kept since the 2004-2005 academic year, with the winner between the schools earning a trophy and bragging rights for an entire year.Minnesota won the 2018-2019 Border Battle by a margin of 500–380, and the Gophers have claimed the title in 10 of the 15 years, including 9 of the last 11. The rivalry has finished as close as a 10-point margin of victory (445–435 in favor of UW in 2006-2007) and as lopsided as a 250-point margin of victory (565–315 in favor of UMN in 2012-2013).Bowlby said it best when she explained what the rivalry means to Minnesota and Wisconsin natives alike.“I think all Minnesota and Wisconsin natives would agree with me in that this is the biggest rivalry we face, and there isn’t much better than beating the Gophers,” Bowlby said.No matter what happens in the next decade, you can guarantee that the Wisconsin-Minnesota Border Battle will be fun to watch for the excitement and competitiveness it provides on a yearly basis.",An axe to grind,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2016/02/02/its-our-problem-the-growing-heroin-epidemic-across-wisconsin/,"Feb 2, 2016","In 2006, as an incoming college student traveled from Massachusetts to begin her freshman year at University of Wisconsin, she struggled with a painful loss that had nothing to do with homesickness.Vanessa, who requested to be identified by first name only, was experiencing a withdrawal from opioids, detoxing from her Oxycontin addiction for the first time.“That’s how I started my college experience,” Vanessa said. “I felt I was very different from everybody else.”In her mind, Vanessa felt she had nowhere to turn. She didn’t know what campus resources were available to help her cope with her addiction and withdrawal, and she felt her drug dependence set her apart from peers. Ultimately, she dropped out of school and attempted to complete her degree several times over the next eight years.Within that time, Vanessa struggled on and off with prescription drug abuse and heroin addiction.During her last two semesters of school, she found sobriety and decided to use her experiences to build support for other UW students in recovery.Discussions of creating an organization for recovering students had been going on for a few years, but the conversation lacked student input. In January 2014, Vanessa helped co-found Live Free, UW’s first student organization dedicated to fostering a supportive environment for students in recovery and their allies.Ten active members currently form Live Free, and the organization is now trying to promote its services for students on campus as well as incoming ones, current co-chair Travis Fearing said. Fearing’s story is similar to Vanessa’s, and he discovered Live Free when he returned to campus after a two-and-a-half year hiatus.“That first semester, that was such a critical part of my continued recovery as a student and ability to not feel isolated or alienated on this campus,” Fearing said.Live Free, Fearing said, is putting UW on the map for students seeking recovery in college.Wisconsin is not immune to the nationwide heroin epidemic that is plaguing urban and rural areas alike.On Jan. 20, the Wisconsin State Senate unanimously passed the newest set of bills in Rep. John Nygren’s, R-Marinette, Heroin Opiate Prevention and Education legislation. They are now headed to Gov. Scott Walker’s desk.The four bills are among many that Walker has already signed into law, a process that began in 2014. Nygren’s own daughter battled with heroin, and much of his legislation addresses the growing epidemic.Previous HOPE bills-turned-law address many aspects of the heroin epidemic. They give criminal immunity to people who call 911 on a witnessed overdose, allow pharmacies to give patients naloxone — an anti-overdose medication — without a prescription and create regional treatment programs in underserved areas of the state. ‘Dose of reality’: State Assembly passes anti-heroin bill
A bill to make anti-overdose medication more readily accessible passed on a unanimous bipartisan voice vote in Tuesday’s Assembly session. Rep. Read…Public leaders’ recent focus on anti-heroin legislation aligns with statistics. According to DOJ, Wisconsin State Crime Laboratories examined 1,130 heroin cases in 2014. That number more than quadrupled since 2008, where the laboratories only saw 270 cases. The Center for Disease Control reported a 286 percent increase in heroin abuse between 2002 and 2013. Wisconsin Department of JusticeWisconsin Department of JusticeAccording to CDC, heroin use has more than doubled among people aged 18 to 25 in the past decade, with 45 percent of heroin users also addicted to opioid painkillers. These painkillers are often a trigger for addiction and abuse of harder drugs, including heroin.Richard Brown, substance abuse expert and professor in the Department of Family Medicine in UW’s School of Medicine and Public Health, said while heroin addiction is most rampant among young people, it can happen to anyone.He said since opioid pain medications are controlled substances, people often think they are safe, so they keep taking them after their prescription expires, and become addicted.Prescription drugs cause more deaths than breast cancer, car crashes in state
State leaders are working to lower drug overdose rates, particularly by ending inappropriate usage of prescription drugs. Not only are Read…Lori Cross Schotten, spokesperson for Wisconsin United We CAN, an organization that aims to increase addiction awareness and provide support for families, experienced firsthand the dangers of prescription painkillers when her son became addicted to them.She said prescription drugs especially affect young people whose brains are still developing. It alters their dopamine levels, and they gain a tolerance to the drug, causing them to turn to heroin.For people who are taking a prescription drug like Vicodin for a month, which is what happened to Cross Schotten’s son, the body stops producing dopamine, and the medication ends up as the body’s only source of the drug. So, when the patient runs out of the prescription, the brain still tells their body that it needs that synthesized drug, Cross Schotten explained.Brown said people then turn to heroin because it is cheaper. Opioid pain pills run at usually a dollar per milligram, so a pill’s price could land between $10 to $80, Brown said. Heroin, on the other hand, is much less expensive. According to The Washington Post, a single dose of heroin often costs less than a pack of cigarettes.“Although many people promise themselves they would never do heroin at some point, because of urges and cravings that people get, [along with] the tolerance and expense, people switch over to heroin,” Brown said.While Live Free created an on-campus community for students in recovery, some off-campus organizations help students as well. The Aaron J. Meyer Foundation owns two houses on Gorham Street, Aaron’s House for males and Grace’s House for females. The houses provide living arrangements for students who have gone through addiction rehabilitation programs and are seeking a place to live with supportive peers.Aaron’s House
MARISSA HAEGELE/The Badger HeraldSusan Pierce Jacobsen, AJM Foundation president, said many universities across the country have Collegiate Recovery Communities on campus, where they provide housing and university-supported services for students who have sought recovery. UW does not support an official CRC the way some other Midwestern schools do, and Aaron’s and Grace’s Houses only hold five students each.“We’re essentially a Band-Aid for the bigger solution, which would be a Collegiate Recovery Community in Madison,” Pierce Jacobsen said.While UW’s Sullivan Hall has a substance-free floor, Pierce Jacobsen emphasized that is not the same as a CRC.Sober communities like in Sullivan are mostly for students under 21 who choose not to use alcohol or drugs, but a CRC is for students who already went through substance abuse recovery and want to be around similar peers, Pierce Jacobsen explained.“Rather than being put back in a dorm or living situation with kids that may use drugs or alcohol, they’re near peer support,” Pierce Jacobsen said. “They’re in a safer environment with people that understand them.”While the HOPE bills focus on critical components to addressing the heroin epidemic in Wisconsin, some say there are more issues to take care of.Brown said the biggest gap in confronting the epidemic is funding adequate recovery programs in the state. The lack of funding for sufficient recovery programs, he said, should be addressed under healthcare reform legislation. Vanessa agreed. She said solving the growing addiction crisis isn’t about cutting off the source of the drug — because if people want it, they will find it — but providing treatment options for recovery.“Funding them to sit in a jail cell isn’t helping,” Vanessa said. “Funding them to go to detox and inpatient treatment — that might help.”Cross Schotten said even some current legislation isn’t holding up as much as some hoped it might have. For example, people still hesitate to use the Good Samaritan law. Even though people who call 911 on an overdose cannot be prosecuted for possession, they still have potential to be charged with homicide if they provided the heroin that killed the person who overdosed, Cross Schotten said.But some of Nygren’s upcoming legislation points to possible solutions. A bill introduced Jan. 7 would give grants to counties that establish treatment alternatives for convicted “individuals with certain crimes” instead of jail time.Vanessa said her drug addiction completely changed the course of her life, but with the right support, she was able to overcome it.A year and a half into sobriety and one year after launching Live Free, Vanessa graduated from UW with a bachelor’s degree in gender and women’s studies and communication arts in December 2014.But problem goes beyond her story, and it is not an individual issue. Addiction can happen to anyone, Cross Schotten said.“The most dangerous words any parent can say are ‘not my kid,’” Cross Schotten said. “Looking back, I think I might have been a little complacent because I thought, ‘We’re a good family, and that doesn’t happen to good families,’ and that’s so wrong. Many good families are being impacted.”As the epidemic grows, people are beginning to understand it is actually a public health crisis. Vanessa said in the past, people tended to stereotype those struggling with substance abuse as the “scum of society,” but now more people see that the epidemic affects “suburban America” as well.“I think people are starting to realize, ‘okay, this is our problem, too,'” she said.

According to USA Today, one clown called “Gags” was spotted in Green Bay walking around at night carrying black balloons.Reports continue to state the untruth that the creepy clown pandemic began in SC on Aug 21. WI's Gags was first seen on Aug 1, journalists. pic.twitter.com/VsL9LTd6q9— Evan Harrison Cass (@evancass) October 16, 2016These clowns might not be breaking the law, but they still have inspired mass hysteria among college students at Pennsylvania State University and fear among residents in Wisconsin.When rumors of a clown sighting at Penn State spread through social media at the beginning of October, hundreds of students on the campus took to the streets in search of the clown, according to Time.HALF THE CAMPUS IS ON LOCKDOWN AND THE OTHER HALF IS A MOB RUNNING AROUND CLOWN HUNTING @PENNSTATE WHAT IS GOING ON— Connor Forjan (@Connor4jan) October 4, 2016ClownParanoia: Penn State Clown Riot https://t.co/00wSwFKh9r #theclownsarecoming— caleb (@calebmadison_) October 18, 2016Though it may seem unlikely that a single clown could cause a mass mob of students to crowd the streets, it is the clown’s common association with its distorted, horrific depiction in movies that has the power to incite fear, University of Wisconsin communication arts professor Joanne Cantor said.With rosy cheeks and big red noses, clowns have traditionally been intended for entertainment. Today, however, they are more likely to be a source of fear.For some people, a clown’s overly friendly and harmless nature can actually emerge as threatening. This misperception is an anomaly in the human psyche, Cantor said.Clowns’ friendly faces are the epitome of good gone bad. Cantor said that although clowns act relatively silly, their image may appear scary to some, especially children.“What frightens you is different at different ages,” Cantor said. “Particularly for young kids, something that looks sort of like a normal thing but is distorted in some way is really scary.”Behind the curtain of Madison’s concert venues, the undead put on their own performances
For many of Madison’s theaters and concert venues, drama isn’t limited to the stage. Through more than a century of Read…Cantor said many people she interviewed for her research on the impact media has on fear have had bad experiences with clowns during their childhood. Those same people later reported they hate clowns as adults.Deanna Loewenhagen, otherwise known by her professional clowning name of “Apple Annie,” has been an entertainer for 40 years. She said clown phobia has forced her and fellow professional entertainers to learn how to read body language and determine if their presence is unwelcome. If a person appears afraid, Loewenhagen said she is careful not to overwhelm them.Loewenhagen said when nonprofessionals dress like clowns, they often fail at appearing friendly because they don’t know how to properly wear a clown costume. Instead, she said, they look ugly and ultimately scary.“We appear during the day, we don’t go out at night, we don’t jump out in front of people,” Loewenhagen said. “We don’t want to scare children.”Loewenhagen said clown hysteria is resurrected every Halloween, but this year it is even more prevalent because of the various sightings of creepy clowns across the nation.These sightings have made it increasingly difficult for professional clowns like Loewenhagen to come across as a harmless source of entertainment.The fear of clowns and overall hysteria is saddening, Loewenhagen said, because it could lead to a decrease in the number of people who want to pursue clowning as a career and art form.The public’s increasing perception of clowns as scary figures can be connected to their prevalent portrayal as serial killers and stalkers in horror movies.“Mass media in general and literature too, visual images, are so important. They really bring the clown power, bring it to life and make it so memorable.”
Joanne CantorA fear of clowns is often caused by popular horror movies released during a viewer’s formative years, Cantor said.Loewenhagen said the release of horror films like “Poltergeist” from the 1980s and Stephen King’s “It” from the 1990s, where clowns are depicted as villains, was the turning point in which the public’s fear of clowns turned into hysteria.Courtesy of flickr user Miguel Angel ArandaTop 10 must-see Halloween movies for the weekend
Halloween weekend No. 2 is the perfect time to tuck in for a seasonal classic. Whether you’re a horror film aficionado or Read…Prior to those movies, she said she rarely encountered someone who feared clowns and that some people even collected clown memorabilia. Clowns like Bozo and Ronald McDonald used to be on cookie jars and were represented positively in the media.The genre of horror films has the power to manipulate people’s fears, Cantor said. While audiences don’t necessarily like violence, they find themselves innately attracted to it because it arouses their interest.    Visual images in horror movies can influence what people perceive to be scary. After watching the movie “It,” many people began to associate all clowns with their perception of the killer clown character, Cantor said.“Mass media in general and literature too, visual images, are so important,” Cantor said. “They really bring the clown power, bring it to life and make it so memorable.”Viewers escape their own reality when watching a horror movie and are confronted with an alternate reality with unfamiliar problems, Cantor said. People are attracted to the idea of forgetting about their own problems and distracting themselves with someone else’s. This, in turn, relieves people because they can watch other people experience a “living hell,” she said.“By incorporating violence, horror movies have been able to manipulate people’s fears into an appealing portrayal, even if people don’t necessarily enjoy the feelings horror movies induce,” Cantor said.Horror films’ commercial success has increased as modern technology has become more advanced and the movies have become more realistic. Cantor said incomplete plot lines make horror movies easy to produce. In order to gain an audience’s attention, horror movies can simply depict a character having their throat slashed without ever having to present a solid plot.While these movies may be attention grabbing, the graphic visual images may negatively influence viewers, particularly those with mental health problems. The powerful images in horror movies make those with mental health problems more vulnerable to reenact what they’ve watched, Cantor said.Though people continue to see clowns as scary figures, professional clowns like Loewenhagen work to help people overcome the fear and negative stereotypes surrounding clowns.Loewenhagen said professional clowns aren’t just sitting back and taking a hit from creepy clowns. They are taking action to prove that most clowns are friendly.“[Creepy clowns] think it’s funny because people are now afraid and there is an association with killer clowns and robberies and murders and doing bad things to children — everything opposite that a clown would do.”
Deanna LoewenhagenClowns can combat negativity toward their image by joining a larger clown organization, such as the World Clown Association. Groups like this have strict rules for clowns to ensure people adhere to standards for good, clean clowning, Loewenhagen said. Additionally, clowns can take preemptive measures by taking clown classes and understanding how to be courteous to people who have a fear of clowns, she said.“I watch myself, [when] I go [out] in my clown costume,” Loewenhagen said. “If I have to go to the bathroom, I’ll [walk in] and say, ‘Clown is in the building, I’m a friendly clown,’ so that they know.”Though people’s fears of clowns have been rationalized through their portrayal in the media, Loewenhagen said she still believes people should not feel this way. Professional clowns know what they are doing and how to address people’s fear properly because they don’t want to frighten someone in the first place, Loewenhagen said.“[Creepy clowns] think it’s funny because people are now afraid and there is an association with killer clowns and robberies and murders and doing bad things to children — everything opposite that a clown would do,” Loewenhagen said.",Negative clown portrayals in the media shift public perception from amusing to fear inducing,UWM

https://badgerherald.com/features/2020/03/03/a-crispr-conundrum-with-the-advancement-of-gene-editing-technology-ethical-challenges-emerge-for-researchers-policymakers/,"Mar 3, 2020","In 2018, Chinese researcher He Jiankui was imprisoned for editing a human embryo — a procedure which resulted in the birth of the world’s first genetically modified twins.Called “a profound leap of science and ethics” by the Associated Press, Jiankui’s announcement shocked the world of bioethics and opened new avenues of debate for researchers, medical professionals, ethicists, policy analysts and the public. Germline gene editing — like Jiankui performed — alters the genetic code of not just an individual, but of every child, grandchild and great-grandchild the individual has. While somatic gene editing,  which is currently used to treat conditions like sickle-cell anemia, only affects the diseased individual, germline editing alters an entire lineage. It’s illegal in the United States as well as many other countries. For Janet Mertz, a researcher with the University of Wisconsin’s School of Medicine’s Carbone Cancer Center, the ethical debate behind gene editing is nothing new. Back in the 1970s, Mertz worked in Nobel prize-winning biochemist Paul Berg’s lab studying recombinant DNA — DNA made by inserting a gene from one organism into another. Success with recombinant DNA opened the door to bigger possibilities in the realm of genetic engineering, Mertz said, but those successes also posed new ethical questions. “This is the first time people said ‘are there experiments that we might be able to do that we shouldn’t do?’” Mertz said. “Are there experiments we can potentially do that might be too hazardous or unethical for other reasons that we shouldn’t do them?” In 1993, Spanish researcher Francisco Mojica described what became known as a “CRISPR locus.” According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University’s The Broad Institute, the CRISPR locus is a sequence of genes found in the immune systems of certain microbes. It allows scientists to edit the genetic code of an organism at a specific, targeted gene, and the technology has already begun to revolutionize medicine, agriculture, veterinary science and a plethora of other fields. Now, labs all across the UW campus use CRISPR and CRISPR-modified animal models to conduct research.Director of the Genome Editing and Animal Models Center Dustin Rubenstein said “it’s really hard to overstate how much it’s changed our ability to do research.” But, as in the case of the Chinese researcher, there’s always a limit — if not technological, then ethical. John Evans is a sociologist at the University of California, San Diego who studies controversial scientific debates. He spoke to UW students and faculty in February as a part of the weekly Life Sciences Communication Colloquium, where he described gene editing as a slippery slope. Allowing one slightly controversial action makes it easier, as a society, to favor more ethically ambiguous stances on issues like germline editing, Evans said. “A lot of these debates are about the limits that we should put on scientific action,” Evans said. “You have to draw your line on the slope here somewhere.”CRISPR on campusKathy Krentz co-directs GEAM at UW with Rubenstein. Krentz has worked in biotechnology on campus for over 25 years, and at GEAM, she helps create gene-edited animal models for researchers to study both on campus and nationwide. Krentz said researchers can use CRISPR in a wide variety of ways, from knocking out or changing genes to inserting new ones. “We can use CRISPR in many different ways,” she said. “We can create [a] break in the DNA within the genome, and in our lab that’s called creating a knockout animal where we knock out a reset or delete a region. And that’s been something that we’ve done, rather easily and routinely. And what’s been more complicated is to change the genome, where we go in and we create a cut in the genome but then we put in a piece of DNA, or we change some of the base pairs.” At GEAM, Krentz and her team use germline editing techniques to create lineages of genetically engineered animal models.Biochemist Melissa Harrison works with CRISPR in the reproductive cells of fruit flies. Her lab studies what happens to these cells and the proteins they make when different genes are modified. They can then apply their discoveries to other species. “For us, genome editing is largely a tool,” Harrison said. “It’s really opened up a lot of ways that we can start to ask very mechanistic questions.” One of Harrison’s colleagues, biochemist Jill Wildonger, also works with fruit flies. Her lab studies brain cells and how different proteins within them allow them to function differently. Wildonger said CRISPR makes it easier for them to target and modify genes without having to insert foreign, lab-made DNA. “What CRISPR does is it enables us to directly target the genes that are present within cells,” Wildonger said. “Previously, we would have to make DNA constructs that we would then have to get into the cells. And in some cases that has drawbacks, because you’re working with DNA that you’ve made in the lab. It might not be expressed at normal levels, it might not make it to the right position within the cell.” And while Wildonger said CRISPR has revolutionized genetic research, it’s not perfect. For one, it’s only useful in models where the researcher knows the genomic sequence, otherwise, they have no idea what to target. Many organisms have reference sequences available, but the reference sequences cannot account for individual genetic variations. One of the biggest challenges when applying CRISPR is minimizing off-target effects, said GEAM Research Specialist Brent Lehman. “Turns out as much as I try to paint the rosy picture that this genome editing is perfect and precise, there are these off target effects,” Lehman said. “And all that means is while you were performing the genome editing at the site that you want in the genome, something else in the genome got altered.”Off-target effects happen when editing a gene, called the target gene, that cause something else to change in a different gene. Sometimes they’re completely harmless, but they can also be dangerous. And it’s difficult to predict them, Lehman said. Some computer algorithms can help model where they might pop up, and researchers have discovered techniques to limit them, but even in the perfect experiment there’s still a small chance. One new discovery in the field that might make this easier, however, is a technique called prime editing, which edits the genome with more precision. Lehman said he’s excited to try it out in the lab. Harrison said though CRISPR is far more advanced than the technology they used to have, it isn’t 100% efficient. Sometimes other tools prove better alternatives for an experiment — but since CRISPR is new and exciting, there’s pressure to use it for everything. “Because we can now do [CRISPR], when you don’t do it, other scientists and reviewers are like ‘why didn’t you do this?’” Harrison said. “Keeping up with the technology is a challenge because it’s really fast paced and moving quickly. We just need to read more and do more.” A Slippery SlopeSince the widespread popularization of CRISPR techniques, Evans said bioethicists have begun to shift their attitudes towards these technologies. That being said, Evans added, they still mark that distinct barrier between somatic and germline editing. While somatic cell gene editing only affects the individual seeking treatment, germline alters all their offspring — and it’s this distinction that means a whole new realm of ethical issues. For one, Rubenstein said, the new babies born from germline-edited embryos cannot give their informed consent. “A mom might decide that they want this disease cured in their embryo,” Rubenstein said. “But that child doesn’t really get decide, and that’s going to pass down to their children and their children’s children. One of the pillars of medical bioethics is informed consent, right? So, it gets a little tricky when there is this permanent change that’s handed down for all of the generations where no informed consent can possibly be given.”Beyond the question of consent, there’s a question of this technology’s application, Mertz said. Mertz said CRISPR has advanced enough that germline editing for solely the purpose of enhancement is possible — which is why, as detailed in a Nature article, many countries have placed moratoriums, or bans, on the technology. “The future is here now,” she said. “We have the technology to be able to genetically [engineer] humans and make ‘designer’ human beings.”Evans said the idea of “designer” human beings isn’t a new one — functionally, it has the same outcome as eugenics, one of the ideologies behind the Nazi party in World War II. And Evans said even though germline editing for enhancement falls way at the bottom of this slippery slope, it’s the little shifts in morality that push society slowly farther to that point. Evans said while the slope has barriers, these barriers can break down. While many researchers, like Lehman and Rubenstein, oppose germline editing in humans, the National Academies of Science released a statement in 2017 stating germline gene editing could one day be permitted for serious conditions. This excludes editing for enhancement. Evans said germline editing technology tempts some — like Jiankui, the jailed researcher — because of its immense potential. “The very first thing people tried to modify was a human embryo,” Evans said. “And so this sort of eugenic impulse rears its head like, ‘gosh, we can finally modify it.’”Communicating CRISPR Chair of the Life Sciences Communications Department at UW Dominique Brossard is an expert on public opinions of science. Brossard also has firsthand experience working with gene editing — she received her masters degree in plant biotechnology.Brossard said while scientists make the distinction between germline gene editing and somatic gene editing when assessing the ethical implications of the technologies, the public tends to make a different distinction — one between editing for therapeutic purposes and enhancement purposes. Essentially, this boils down to the distinction between gene editing to fix a medical condition and gene editing for personal enhancement. Brossard and several of her colleagues recently published some of their work about public perceptions of gene editing in Science magazine. They used data from the National Academy of Science consensus report to argue greater integration of public opinion into gene editing policy. “We need to actually have broad public participation to discuss this,” Brossard said. “This is something that’s going to affect everyone, so the public engagement needs to be taken seriously, to make sure that we know ahead of time how to regulate. Because there’s no right or wrong answer. This is a policy. This is a political question, it’s not a scientific one. So that means that scientists themselves cannot just answer that.”Brossard said instead of going into the purely technical aspect of CRISPR and educating the public about the science, what’s more important is to start a discussion about the kind of values they hold as a society, and what the best way to apply the technology might be. Brossard said since people tend to use mental shortcuts when thinking about difficult topics, institutions should foster deep discussions that go beyond partisan or religious boundaries about these issues.  “It’s about what kind of society we want to be,” Brossard said. “Obviously you want to be able to understand what the technology can do or what the technology cannot do or how the technology can go wrong, but the decision to go forward or whatever, that’s really a policy decision.”Wildonger said communicating CRISPR is important to her and her lab because the technology isn’t too difficult to learn about, and it can help people who don’t have a science background get interested in and excited about research. When it comes to applying the technology, Wildonger said it’s important to foster open communication between experts and the public. Plus, she said making sure students receive a sound science education helps, because when students learn about these new technologies, they’re likely to be more discretous towards — rather than scared of — future technological advances. “We want to [have a] dialogue,” Brossard said. “We want to get to a point where scientists from genetics, or social scientists for that matter, or religious groups or a representation of a consumer group, or parents and family of those who have the genetic disease can actually decide on the pros and cons, all together to reach a compromise.”","A CRISPR Conundrum: With the advancement of gene editing technology, ethical challenges emerge for researchers, policymakers",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2019/03/27/mental-health-and-students-of-color-an-oppressive-neglected-epidemic/,"Mar 27, 2019","Most conversations about access to mental health treatment at the University of Wisconsin — whether they take place on the meme page or in student government — are concerned with the limited resources the university dedicates to student mental health services, most notably the counseling and psychiatric services provided through University Health Services.But amidst general frustration about UW’s disregard for student mental health are a number of voices calling on UW to address racial and ethnic disparities in mental health treatment — that UHS mental health services are uniquely failing students of color.These voices are badly, badly needed.Researchers agree that people who experience everyday racism, or microaggressions, are more likely to show symptoms of anxiety and depression. In a 2017 article, Marva Robinson described struggling every day “against a known traumatic event called racism … At every turn you’re reminded that you are a second-class citizen and you don’t have access to things that you should. That’s damaging to the psyche.”The same is true of students of color at UW. In the 2018 “Health Minds Study,” UW researchers reported on the disproportionate mental health burden faced by Black, Latinx and Native students. All of these groups, the report found, screen positively for depression and anxiety, and are “overwhelmingly more likely” to have suicidal ideation.A major problem: Students of color feel unwelcome on campus and in the classroom
As Rishard Bournes enters Grainger Hall to attend his business classes, the mere sight of numbers — clocks indicating the Read…Black UW students were more likely than any other racial or ethnic group to report experiencing these mental health problems.But even the research that addresses the unique mental health problems people and students of color face rarely identify white supremacy, the existing social system that delivers the benefits of whiteness to white people, as the purveyor of their trauma. Naming the effect of racism — students of color struggling with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation at vastly higher rates than white students — without naming the systemic cause neglects the depth of the changes that must be made to student mental health services.One manifestation of white supremacy in American society, and at UW, is cultural racism — when a dominant social group shapes norms, values and standards to the advantage of white people. Doing this allows white people to assign normality to the behavior of white people, and to rationalize the mistreatment of people of color. Unable to validate the thoughts and emotions of people of color — especially when the emotions relate to traumas of racism — it becomes impossible for white people to fully empathize with people of color.White mental health providers, wherever they are employed, aren’t immune to this form of racism. In some extreme instances, they characterize the struggle against racism as a mental illness (see “protest psychosis” and the racist history of schizophrenia diagnoses), but more often they fail to empathize with — and validate — the experiences of their patients of color.At UW, many students of color often request counselors of color from UHS, knowing that these counselors will empathize more deeply with their experiences — particularly the feeling of isolation that comes from existing in a predominantly white institution, in a predominantly white community. Before UHS hired a mental health provider, Corey Steele, to focus specifically on students of color, these requests were usually denied.Call to action: While administration faces pressures to improve campus climate, students work to create change within their own communities

In 2016, Isabel Denning, a member of the Oneida Nation, committed suicide after facing financial insecurity and the trauma of multiple sexual assaults. Those who knew her said the racism and isolation she experienced at UW contributed to her declining mental health and to her eventual suicide.Isabel sought treatment with UHS, but was dropped, according to The Badger Herald, over “cultural differences and miscommunication.”I do not know, truly, how racism affects individual mental health. I am white — and my anxiety disorder is not the result or effect of systemic oppression. But I know what it is to benefit from a mental health system made in my image.The counselors I have seen have never questioned my choice to use or abstain from psychiatric treatment. I have always seen a counselor who looked and spoke like me. Even when I have been questioned and challenged by counselors, I never felt as though they considered me irrational or undeserving of care. I’ve never visited a therapist who couldn’t empathize with my experience as an anxious white person.Students of color who visit white counselors can’t say this. Their traumas go untreated, or invalidated, deepening their sense of isolation and hopelessness. These students need more mental health professionals of color. Counselors and psychiatrists who recognize the trauma wrought by racism can empathize with students living through it.Sam Ropa (ropa@wisc.edu) is a senior majoring in geography and anthropology.

https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2014/05/01/female-privilege/,"May 1, 2014","Being part of a homogeneous majority my entire life and reaping the rewards my sexual orientation, skin color and socioeconomic status have brought me, I never really considered that I could, in fact, have more privileges than I was giving myself credit for.But in two articles published this past month (and probably many more that I have not yet read), I was clearly proven wrong. Because I am a woman, I, according to these male authors, have a certain level of female privilege.First Mark Saunders, a Thought Catalog contributor, compiled a list of 18 female privileges, framing them as things that women, blinded by their gender entitlements, “seem to not understand.” This post, just another example of patronizing patriarchal propaganda, only reveals the discrepancies between the male perception of the plight of women and the reality of what being a woman in the 21st century means. Here are a few of my favorite estrogen-inspired privileges that I cannot wait to exploit.Never mind that, all too often, individuals, including rapists themselves, are inclined to place blame on the victims of sexual assaults and rapes (“she was asking for it”).Since the glass ceiling, the invisible boundary that prevents a female worker from earning a salary equivalent to that of her male counterpart, is still restricting working women’s wages (and women only earn 77 cents to a man’s dollar), it’s far too likely that a woman could end up marrying a man who makes more than her. But considering that legislative bodies across the United States, forming a law-making monopoly predominantly dominated by men, are well-aware of wage inequality yet have remained relatively inactive, in some cases men are preventing women from earning wages equivalent or greater than their spouses.Ever since Roe v. Wade legalized abortions in 1973, efforts have been made to curb and overturn this judicial decision in an attempt to strip women of a right to their bodies. Reproductive rights have been debated for centuries, not just in pro-choice and pro-life terms, but also regarding the use of contraceptives in general. Having a child is not a private decision, but one that society, male and female, collectively has a vested interest.While this particular so-called female privilege stems from one archaic paradigm, “men are bread-winners, women are caregivers,” the rest of these are from ones such as “men are dominant, women are submissive” and “men are strong, women are weak.” Women, with their “female privilege” are left to shoulder the blame for oppressive, assumptive gender norms and a culture in which men still maintain the upper hand. What society, what Saunders, fails to understand is that women no longer want to carry these labels.The Daily Cardinal then tackled this topic in an article entitled “Gender is an oppressive social construct.” The author, a self-labeled “feminist,” asserts that even though women are oppressed, they are actually simultaneously granted certain privileges. One example cited is the author’s female friend, who was able to wear a dress that sexualized her, a privilege that a man cannot share because “there is no way for a male to hyper-sexualize himself and be taken seriously in any social setting.”First of all, men are certainly able to dress in a way to sexualize themselves. Just because the author of this article is male and may not acknowledge that this is the case does not mean it’s not possible.Additionally, making the assessment that oppression actually gives the oppressed certain privileges is demonstrative of complete ignorance on the author’s part. It’s comparable to saying that, although Black people have unarguably experienced injustice and oppression, by being able to use the “n-word,” they have privilege.The author then mentions that his female friend was violated by a strange man who grabbed her butt, something that he argues wouldn’t have happened if the strange man was brought up in a society in which men could be hyper-sexualized too, to gain a better understanding of mutual respect.So basically, if men and women both had the same opportunities to express their sexuality, neither gender would feel the need to act with discourtesy toward the other. If both sexes had the same opportunities to experience violations of personal space, rather than just the hyper-sexualized women, gender equity would be promoted, and any notion of privilege would be gone, a notion that is entirely ridiculous.What both authors fail to realize is that this notion of female privilege, and what it all entails, is often blatantly incorrect and outright unsupported by the females who are supposedly benefiting form this treatment.Briana Reilly (breilly@badgerherald.com) is a freshman intending to major in journalism and international studies.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2016/03/15/the-cost-of-knowledge-overwhelming-loan-debt-now-the-norm/,"Mar 15, 2016","Colton Wickland, like an increasing number of college students in recent years, faces anxiety about how to pay for college.When he was accepted into University of Wisconsin, Wickland knew his parents would not be able to support him financially.“My parents don’t have any money,” Wickland said. “I wouldn’t say we’re financially bad-off or poor, but [we have] no funding left for college, no savings or anything like that.”As a freshman, Wickland has taken initiative to try to support himself financially. He works at University Health Services as an undergraduate assistant for alcohol and drug prevention and also chairs the Green Fund of Associated Students of Madison.But aside from his jobs, the need-based aid he receives and $7,000 in scholarships, he still needs to take out about $6,000 in student loans every year.But he said getting a college degree is worth taking a risk with student loans. He works to help pay off his student debt, and through ASM, he actively helps other students who have similar, or even worse situations than him.  In 2013, even before coming to college, Wickland testified during the Senate hearing of a bill called “Higher Ed Lower Debt,” which would allow people in Wisconsin with student loan debts to refinance their loans at a lower interest rate.Wickland expects to have $20,000 in loan debt by the time he graduates. In addition to his undergraduate debt, Wickland plans to attend medical school after graduation, which will probably cost him an additional $100,000.“It definitely freaks me out, because if something goes wrong, then I’m basically done for,” Wickland said. “If I were to slip up and drop out of medical school or something, and I didn’t get a decent job, I would have student loans for the rest of my life basically.”Wickland is far from the only student facing student loan debt worries. Many students face far higher costs. While Wickland expects $20,000 in loan debt by the time he graduates, the average debt of a UW graduate is $28,768, according to Michelle Curtis, UW’s Office of Student Financial Aid associate director. The national average in 2014 was $28,950, she said.Wisconsin ranked third in the nation for number of college students graduating with student loan debt, with 70 percent of graduates having debt when they get out of college, according to a 2015 report by the Institute for College Access and Success.According to UW’s 2014-15 Data Digest statistics, more than 50 percent of undergraduate students who graduated in 2013-14 carry loan debts at rates that have steadily increased between 2004 and 2015.But financial aid has not been increasing as quickly as the cost of living, leaving students without enough support, Drew Anderson, postdoctoral researcher at the Wisconsin Harvesting Opportunities for Postsecondary Education Lab, said.Therefore, a college education is also more challenging for low-income students to afford. Students from families with low incomes have lower rates of getting to college and lower rates of completing college, Anderson said.As more students seek out a college education with cost-of-living expenses on the rise, the issue of college affordability continues to be a focal point for politicians.Wisconsin legislators from both sides of the aisle have honed in on student debt in recent years, but Republican and Democratic policies vary greatly.One of the most recent legislative efforts to make college more affordable is Gov. Scott Walker’s college affordability package, the majority of which is expected to be signed into law after it is voted on in the Senate March 15.The package includes bills that would increase grants for technical schools, create an emergency grant program, give students tax deductions on interest, increase internship opportunities and provide students with financial literacy learning opportunities.Walker proposes plan to make college more affordable, but no financial aid increase for UW System
Earlier this week Gov. Scott Walker announced a multi-faceted plan to make higher education more affordable, a step one expert said was positive, Read…When the Assembly passed the bills Feb. 17, Walker said in a radio address they pushed Wisconsin one step closer to making college more affordable for students and his tuition freeze has already saved students an average of $6,311 per year.“These proposals are a critical part of our work to lower the cost of higher education and ease the burden of student loan debt,” Walker said. Rep. David Murphy, R-Greenville, said Walker’s college affordability package is just a start, and the student loan debt crisis is something that will continue to be addressed in the future.“College affordability is something that needs constant work and really somebody keeping an eye on it, somebody really caring about what kind of shape our students are in going forward,” Murphy said. But Rep. Katrina Shankland, D-Stevens Point, said Walker’s affordability package “doesn’t even scratch the surface” of the student loan debt crisis.Throughout the past year, Democrats have proposed competing policies including ones that would allow students to refinance their loans, increase need-based aid and make the first 60 credits of college debt-free. None of the proposals made it through the Legislature this session.Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, said student loan debt impacts Wisconsin’s future. “We’re suffocating our next generation — our future leaders — with this crushing student loan debt,” Sargent said. “It’s hindering Wisconsin’s ability to grow economically, and it’s preventing graduates from realizing their dreams.” Sargent said she hopes her plan for debt-free college, called the “Wisconsin Promise,” is able to make it through the Legislature next session, along with the student loan refinancing bill, “higher ed, lower debt.” UW has some resources to help students navigate their loan debt situations.The Office for Financial Aid is responsible for entrance and exit counseling for students with loans, Curtis said, with online tutorials and quizzes to guide them through the student loan process. MARISSA HAEGELE/The Badger HeraldCurtis said there are other programs on campus that help reduce stress caused by student loans. A program called Financial Aid Security Track, or FASTrack, aims to provide security to students by offering them financial aid packages, ensuring they receive the same level of funding throughout their years of study. Center of Educational Opportunity helps students achieve academic success, and teaches students how to manage their money and make budget and career plans.She said students should take advantage of the benefits of federal loans, such as income-sensitive programs and forgiveness programs. But not all students access or even know about these on-campus resources. Wickland admitted he has not sought assistance from them, and doesn’t even know what his student loan interest rates are.ASM Chair Madison Laning said students need to be in the know and be responsible for their college funding plans.Laning said many students who have loan debt lack information about getting loans, such as the consequences of loan debts moving forward in their college career. She said financial literacy is important for students to have before they take out large loans.The impact of excessive student loan debt extends into all spheres of student life, such as personal spending habits, which could influence the economy in the years to come.Wickland said his student loan debt will keep forcing him to be frugal for years after college, without the ability to purchase a house or a car. Even when he finds a job, a large portion of his salary will be used to pay for the debt that accumulated from funding his college education. With this mounting debt, Wickland said he at times feels like he’s being punished for trying to better himself and society.When students enter the workforce, Laning said, they will not be able to buy things like housing and cars that stimulate the economy.She said UW needs to find more state funding, research money and donations instead of relying on tuition income to pay for the university’s needs.“I think the number one issue is the rising cost of tuition, and it’s coupled with the rising cost of living, so I think our institution needs to find funding sources besides tuition, and keep the entire campus [from] running on the back of students,” Laning said.Despite how daunting the expense of student loan debts can be, Curtis said the value of higher education makes it a worthwhile investment, and students need to be smart about their borrowing strategy.“Looking ahead for the generation that’s borrowing right now, [they need] to borrow smart,” Curtis said. “If you don’t end up getting your education, or you’ve added years on to going to school because you didn’t want to borrow some student loans, I would argue that you’ve lost.”","The cost of knowledge: Average UW student graduates with nearly $30,000 in loan debt",UWM

https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2008/09/02/drinking-age-trample/,"Sep 2, 2008","As underage students return to University of Wisconsin this fall and freshmen attend the university for the first time, discussion will inevitably turn to the relentless oppression engendered by the drinking age. Students across campus will spend their hard-earned money on fake IDs, borrow the old IDs of their relatives and their classmates who look just remotely like themselves and take any risk to get into the bars and purchase liquor. Don’t be fooled by UW’s recent drop off the list of the nation’s top 20 party schools — the culture of underage binge drinking is alive and well on campus.College presidents and chancellors from around the country have recently formed an organization known as the Amethyst Initiative to lobby lawmakers to rethink the federal drinking age. So far, this group includes 128 college administrators, including the former chancellor of UW-Parkside, Jack Keating and the president of Ripon College, David Joyce .Incoming UW chancellor Biddy Martin has a chance to make her mark by supporting this worthy cause. She seemed to indicate openness to the Amethyst Initiative in a recent Capital Times interview. It would be a radical move for her to support lowering the drinking age. Binge drinking is a huge problem for the campus and the state, and conventional wisdom indicates such a policy could make the problem worse. Thus, support for the initiative from Martin has the potential to make a big splash and draw a lot of attention.Many studies have been conducted on the effects of the legal drinking age, and available evidence seems to indicate the current drinking age just moves the problem underground. It breeds the kind of dangerous clandestine drinking college administrators should really worry about. The kind of drinking that detracts from students’ educational experience and leads to sexual assault, unplanned pregnancies, STIs, visits to detox and even deaths. Alcohol kills about 1,700 18- to 24-year-old students every year.Congress has effectively mandated the 21-year-old drinking age since 1984 by depriving any state with a lower drinking age of highway funds. Unfortunately, it is not clear the law has had the desired effect. Alcohol-related automobile fatalities have indeed declined since the passage of the law, but they were in decline long before the law’s implementation due to safer car designs, the proliferation of seatbelts and airbags, tougher enforcement and the trend toward designated drivers.While the decline in fatalities has been particularly large among 16- to 20-year-olds, fatalities have declined much less among 21- to 24-year-olds between 1982 and 2004. The incidence of alcohol-related automobile fatalities for 21-year-olds was twice that of 18-year-olds in 2002. This indicates raising the drinking age simply shifted the age group most at risk of alcohol-related deaths.It is also clear underage prohibition does not prevent underage drinking. According to the latest National Survey on Drug and Alcohol Use in 2005, 85 percent of 20-year-olds reported using alcohol and two out of five consider themselves binge drinkers, consuming five or more drinks at within a short period of time. To put that number in context, only about 15 percent of adults are considered binge drinkers. According to the CDC, underage drinking is much more likely to involve hard liquor, since the goal for most underage drinkers is to get wasted as fast as possible.There are many policy solutions that are likely to target risky drinking rather than punishing underage but responsible drinking. Alcohol taxes in Wisconsin are the second lowest in the nation, and raising them by a modest amount, while unpopular, could reduce binge drinking at the margins. Another important policy to supplement the lower drinking age is maintaining zero-tolerance laws for drivers under 21. This should be accompanied by toughening the penalties for drunken driving violations and potentially marking drivers’ licenses so those convicted of DUIs cannot be served in bars and liquor stores.The time has come for lawmakers to end their counterproductive efforts to stamp out youth drinking. It does more harm than good to turn drinking into a “forbidden fruit,” prohibited even after the commonly accepted age of adulthood. It is better to allow drinking when one is still under parental supervision so parents can encourage healthy decisions. The underage individuals already breaking the law by consuming any alcohol tend to do so in unregulated and reckless ways. And of course, there’s no logical reason someone who’s old enough to vote and fight for their country isn’t old enough to legally have a beer with their friends. So please, Ms. Martin, get behind the Amethyst Initiative and help reframe the alcohol debate away from prohibition and toward sane and fair limitations.Ryan Greenfield (rgreenfield@badgerherald.com) is a junior majoring in political science and economics.","Drinking age tramples rights, endangers health",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2018/03/22/with-pressure-to-sign-hastily-some-landlords-can-take-advantage-of-students-inexperience/,"Mar 22, 2018","When University of Wisconsin senior Delaney Egan decided to move into Equinox Apartments, she was hoping to have one “good” apartment experience before wrapping up her college career.While Egan had had a largely positive experience with past apartments, she had faced some troubles, like when someone shot her window with a BB gun in sophomore year. She believed the newer, high rise building would make up for all the problems she’d had earlier. But after just a few months into her Equinox lease, she realized the building was more like “a party dorm without a house fellow.”Egan’s neighbors — four post-graduate students — would constantly disrupt her and her roommates, leaving them uncomfortable in their own home. In addition to making noise, Egan said her neighbors had also damaged her property and an exit sign in the hallway.“My roommate’s a night shift nurse and shares her room wall with the outside hallway,” Egan said. “Sometimes, [neighbors] would come and just pound on her wall and on our door in the middle of the night for no reason and wake us up.”When she tried to do something about the constant disruptions, Egan faced questions and challenges. She said her landlord would blame her and her roommates for making noise and barely reprimanded her neighbors for anything they did. Not only did Egan feel ignored, but she also felt she didn’t know about any resources that could help her.“I think landlords tend to take advantage of those who haven’t lived on their own, are new to the area or are renting for the first time. [Landlords] say that ‘this is how it’s supposed to go,’ but it’s not.”
Abby SchaeferEgan is one of many student renters who have faced tough situations, but didn’t know what to do about them. This becomes worse when landlords and property managers fail to cooperate with otherwise largely inexperienced renters.While many landlords treat their tenants fairly, students tend to be unaware of their tenant rights and responsibilities, making them easy to be taken advantage of.Most freshmen have to decide on sophomore year housing within three months of arriving on campus. UW senior Maggie Heinemann said she didn’t know enough about what to do and felt pressured into making a decision quickly.“[Apartment companies] make it seem like you have to sign right away otherwise all units will be gone but that’s not true,” Maggie Heinemann said. “There’s just a lot of pressure on freshmen to sign and then they end up signing with people they barely know because they don’t know better.”Maggie Heinemann, who currently lives in a JSM Properties apartment, said she chose to live in UW Housing in her sophomore year because she felt “overwhelmed” and unprepared. Constant emails and fliers from property management companies didn’t make it easier for her to know what to do.UW alumna Fallon Morrissey said student renters are “not that difficult to be taken advantage of” because of how inexperienced they are. Choosing where to live so early in their college career could increase their likelihood of being manipulated.“I think if you keep a good open line of communication, it allows tenants to trust you and be more comfortable letting you know about issues they’re having or anything like that.”
Elizabeth HoffRandall Park Rentals Property Manager Sheena Lewis said most student concerns stem from the confusion that comes with being a first-time renter. They don’t always remember details, like when to pay their rent and sometimes, information is miscommunicated. To alleviate this, Lewis said they like to send email reminders reiterating this information.Palisade Property Manager Elizabeth Hoff said keeping an open line of communication between managers and renters is key to ensuring students talk openly about their problems.“I think if you keep a good open line of communication, it allows tenants to trust you and be more comfortable letting you know about issues they’re having or anything like that,” Hoff said.Still, clear communication between tenants and landlords is not the case with all landlords.Halfway through her senior year, Morrissey’s apartment changed management, which led to some misunderstandings. When she’d initially signed her lease, Morrissey had agreed to take her new apartment “as is,” meaning it wasn’t cleaned out when she first moved in. According to their lease, this also meant that she and her roommates could move out of the apartment without cleaning it because that’s how they first received it.But Morrissey’s new landlord did not accept this agreement and threatened to take money from their security deposit if everything wasn’t “spotless” at move out, she said. When Morrissey pointed out the lease terms to him, he refused to change his mind. Eventually, Morrissey’s father, who is a lawyer, had to step in and show the landlord he was wrong.“It’s frustrating whenever you don’t get taken seriously for something you know you’re right about. Without my dad, we wouldn’t have had the same outcome,” Morrissey said. “We would’ve been bullied into deep cleaning our apartment so the landlord wouldn’t have had to pay cleaners.”Another UW alumna, Abby Schaefer, faced a similar situation her sophomore year. Schaefer’s apartment was extremely cold during winter, and their heater didn’t work that well. Her landlord came to check the thermostat, concluded the apartment’s two external walls were responsible and told Schaefer and her roommates they “couldn’t do anything about it.”In Madison, housing development cycle lacks affordability

He eats a brief meal before beginning his Read…The father of one of Schaefer’s roommates was not satisfied with the landlord’s inaction and researched tenant rights and laws. He found that apartment buildings had to be kept at at least 67 degrees Fahrenheit, which was above what her landlord maintained. After her roommate’s father “threatened” the landlord with their rights, Schaefer received space heaters and had their part of the electricity bill paid for.“I think landlords tend to take advantage of those who haven’t lived on their own, are new to the area or are renting for the first time,” Schaefer said. “[Landlords] say that ‘this is how it’s supposed to go,’ but it’s not.”In addition to being inexperienced, student renters are often unaware of tenant laws and their rights. These laws also tend to change frequently in Madison, which makes them even more difficult to keep up with, Ald. Zach Wood, District 8, said.Bill on Walker’s desk would allow landlords to evict tenants for ‘criminal activity’
A bill that would allow landlords to serve tenants eviction notices for criminal activity is headed to Gov. Scott Walker’s Read…“There are a number of first-time renters who don’t fully understand what their rights are,” Wood said. “This is further complicated by continued revisions to tenant protections by the state.”Though the process took a while, Morrissey attributes her success to her awareness of tenant rights and resources. Morrissey believes many student renters forgo taking action because they don’t know what to do and they’d rather let it go.“As an international student I was afraid that if I did anything wrong, no matter how small it was, I could lose my status at the university.”
Shyamal AnadkatUW senior Codie Heinemann is one renter who felt this way. When her landlord at Skylight Apartments began making “uncomfortable” remarks about women and charging her and her roommates more money for utilities than their lease specified, she didn’t want to pursue the matter. Though she knows she would win the case if she did, Codie Heinemann said she could become a target and possibly lose her security deposit.“We figured let’s not take it any further because it could hurt us down the road,” Codie Heinemann said. “But it’s one of those frustrating things that if we’re expected to follow the lease then why not them?”UW senior Shyamal Anadkat said his junior year landlord JSM threatened to evict him and his roommates multiple times for not keeping the apartment clean. But Anadkat said it felt like JSM was “picking on them for every little thing” and didn’t even clean the apartment before handing it over to him. He said they didn’t listen to any of his cleaning requests at the beginning of move-in either.When given a choice to take action, Anadkat said he felt like he had no rights and that he was simply being ignored. Like Codie Heinemann, he too, was afraid his security deposit would be taken away. Being an international student made the whole process much more difficult.“As an international student I was afraid that if I did anything wrong, no matter how small it was, I could lose my status at the university,” Anadkat said. “I also didn’t know what more I could do other than what I had already done.”JSM declined to provide a comment for this article.Egan said she’s faced frequent inconsistencies when it came to her landlord’s responses. In some cases, her landlord simply overlooked her complaints but took action in others. Egan believes her landlord had gotten accustomed to students renting her properties and now simply regards any negative consequences as “young, college kids having fun.”“There is no standardization and that’s an issue,” Egan said.While students feel they can be taken advantage of, landlords also face challenges renting to them.UW alumna Maddie Steinbrenner said students might not be as concerned with being careful because college housing has low expectations and people only stay for a year or two. Egan said it’s possible many students think it’s alright to act how they want because the living space is for young people.People in the apartment above Egan’s urinated in their balcony, which eventually dripped into hers. After getting it professionally cleaned twice, she took the matter to her landlord who asked for proof in the form of pictures. The landlord refused to take action without this proof, which Egan said would be impossible and indecent to obtain.Maggie Heinemann said some of her neighbors are noisy and run through the hallways, which can be a nuisance for landlords to deal with. In another scenario, she was touring an apartment and saw one of its tenants had 15 guinea pigs living there. While the apartment was looked after, the room smelled bad and needed a disclaimer from the property manager that the house would be cleaned between move outs.“I think a lot of people keep [apartments] dirty sometimes and when landlords are walking through, they have to navigate that,” Maggie Heinemann said.Madison landlord Dennis Martin said the most trouble he’s faced with his tenants is with late rent payments. But he said he’s flexible with them because he’s a smaller landlord.Lewis said sometimes they get noise complaints. But a majority of students are receptive to notices and warnings. She said parental involvement can also be an issue because when students have a problem, they tend to go through their parents rather than communicate directly with property managers.But for most part, their relationship with students has been good, Lewis said.“We love student renters. It’s fun, it’s always changing,” Lewis said. “We like to throw events so they know we appreciate them. We know school is stressful because a lot of us in the office have been through it too so we definitely see where they’re coming from.”Wood said raising awareness is the first step landlords and UW can take to help student renters know what they have to do. If students are aware of their options and rights early on, it’ll reduce their likelihood of being manipulated.UW Housing spokesperson Brendon Dybdahl said in an email to The Badger Herald that every year, house fellows host programs to share information with residents about moving to non-UW housing. Because the idea of moving can be stressful for freshmen, UW Housing, Campus Area Housing Office and the Tenant Resource Center co-host a series of workshops on second-year housing to educate students about their choices for sophomore year.The James to open its doors to Madison community summer 2017
As the student housing market continues to expand in Madison, a new development will be opening its doors to tenants next Read…Martin said he likes to give his tenants a few days to look over the lease before discussing it with them. That way, they get enough time to understand it and ask him questions. Hoff said Palisade follows a similar process.“With a lease, you’re reading a lot of heavy material so I like to give [tenants] three to five days and email the lease to them in advance so they have time to read it,” Martin said.Madison Property Management Marketing Director Hannah Kimyon said in an email to The Badger Herald that the company takes efforts similar to Martin’s. She said MPM understands renting for the first time can be overwhelming, which is why they provide frequent online and in-person opportunities to talk to students about the entire leasing process.“You have to read a lot of things on your own. It’s more about taking the initiative and time to do that.”
Maddie SteinbrennerAnother topic of contention for students is their security deposit. Several student renters are afraid they won’t get this deposit back if they report an issue. Hoff said every tenant has the freedom to care for their apartment as they wish and if they care for it properly, they’ll get their full deposit back.Lewis suggested students “nitpick” at every part of their apartment when they move in and make a note of everything that is potentially broken so they’re not blamed for it later. Renters can always negotiate with the landlord in case they’re dissatisfied with their deposit return.Organizations like the Tenant Resource Center can also be a helpful resource for students and inexperienced renters alike. The resource is accessible online and keeps up to date with legislative changes. Konon, Schaefer and Morrissey all found it to be useful when addressing their complaints.Codie Heinemann said she would’ve liked to know about resources like the Tenant Resource Center before she signed a lease for the first time. Schaefer agreed and said it was “disappointing” her landlord would’ve left them cold if someone who knew their rights and knew where to get information hadn’t stepped in.Steinbrenner said her landlords had always sat down and explained major lease terms to her carefully, which was helpful. But she also emphasized that students need to take time and initiative to read through their leases and research their rights if they don’t know them.“You have to read a lot of things on your own,” Steinbrenner said. “It’s more about taking the initiative and time to do that. I was more serious about it when looking for apartments and it helped me.”UW alum Kevin Castro, who has formerly held positions at The Badger Herald, echoed Steinbrenner’s sentiment. Castro lived in a JSM apartment in his junior year and had taken pictures of the place before moving out in case the company had any complaints.A few weeks later, JSM contacted Castro and his roommates, saying they’d found broken and unclean items in their old apartment. Castro showed them the pictures and asked JSM for their evidence, but the company said they weren’t “legally obliged” to show their tenants any images.JSM would’ve taken Castro and his roommates to the small claims court if they didn’t pay the fine. That’s when his roommate filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and told JSM they were ready for legal action. JSM backed down and returned their full security deposit, Castro said.Castro said his and his roommate’s research helped them work through this “messy” process. Though it took some time, it helped them avoid financial and legal responsibility for something they didn’t do. Another UW senior Brendan Konon also found it useful to do this when his landlord refused to allow his emotional support animal to live in his apartment even after his therapist verified his need for it.“If you’re getting screwed over by your landlord, I’d encourage people to do their research and figure out their options,” Castro said. “If you fight back even a little, you can work your way out, or at least come to a better solution.”","With pressure to sign hastily, some landlords can take advantage of students’ inexperience",UWM

https://badgerherald.com/features/2016/09/06/locked-up-and-locked-out-milwaukee-struggles-with-incarceration-eviction/,"Sep 6, 2016","As images of Milwaukee riots made the national newscasts, so did one often-cited statistic: Milwaukee, the largest city in Wisconsin, is one of the most segregated cities in the country.Some striking numbers on poverty and incarceration also made headlines. More than half of black men in their 30s and 40s in Milwaukee have been incarcerated and more than 40 percent of people in central Milwaukee live in poverty.But one issue that hasn’t garnered as much attention is eviction and the role it plays in destabilizing communities.When riots spread across Milwaukee’s north side after a police officer shot and killed a black man Aug. 13, people around the world asked why the particular shooting resulted in such a violent response.State Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, called Sylville Smith’s shooting the “straw that broke the camel’s back,” and said the protests that followed in the Sherman Park neighborhood were the result of a breaking point following the build up of traumatic events.Officer-involved shooting sparks violent riots in Milwaukee
Violent protests erupted Saturday night in Milwaukee after a Milwaukee Police Department officer shot and killed an armed suspect that afternoon. Read…MARISSA HAEGELE/The Badger Herald“The hopelessness that exists for some people because of the trauma on trauma, the lack of opportunities on lack of opportunities, has created a … pressure point that created [the riots] and if we don’t fix that, we are going to have the same problem again,” Taylor said.Until recently, a link between eviction and crime was impossible to back up — academia in America had all but ignored the study of eviction. That changed when sociologist and University of Wisconsin alumnus Matthew Desmond stepped in.In an interview with The Badger Herald, Desmond said eviction threatens community stability and vulnerable citizens living in poverty in Milwaukee.“When you thwart the possibility of a community becoming a community, through evictions, it can really breed an environment for heightened crime and we found that in Milwaukee,” Desmond said.Desmond first began researching eviction while completing his dissertation at UW.
 He received his doctorate from UW in 2010 and now works as an associate professor of sociology and social studies at Harvard University.During his time at UW, there was only one person besides Desmond in the country studying eviction at that time, Tim Smeeding, UW professor of public affairs and economics, said.“There were a lot of people studying foreclosure, people losing their homes that they own because they couldn’t pay their mortgages,” Smeeding said. “But there was very little on the process by which renters are tossed out of their homes.”Desmond’s research resulted in “EVICTED: Poverty and Profit in the American City,” a novel that follows eight families and their experiences with eviction in Milwaukee. It was chosen as UW’s 2016-17 Go Big Read book.Desmond lived in Milwaukee for more than a year, first in a trailer park then in an inner city boarding house, to conduct research for “EVICTED.” Desmond also followed the experience of two landlords in Milwaukee to capture a broad picture of housing insecurity.“I knew that to really understand the dynamics of the low income housing market, to really understand what was going on out there in some of our poorest communities, I needed to get the landlord’s perspectives too,” Desmond said.UW alumnus’ ‘Evicted’ chosen as UW’s next Go Big Read book
University of Wisconsin announced Wednesday an alumnus’ best-selling book, “Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City,” will be the 2016-17 Read…By including the landlords’ stories, Desmond said he can ensure people won’t fall back on “simplistic narratives about tenants being lazy or landlords being greedy.”Desmond decided to research eviction in Milwaukee because it represents what people of moderate means are going through in cities across the country.“I wanted to understand the role that housing plays in creating poverty in America and the role it could play in reducing poverty and social suffering in our cities,” he said. “‘EVICTED’ is a Milwaukee book, but it tells an American story.”Milwaukee is extremely segregated, Smeeding said, and race and socioeconomic status work together to contribute to frequent evictions.“Poor black men are locked up; poor black women are locked out.”
Matthew DesmondDesmond found that among Milwaukee renters, more than one in five black women have been evicted in their lifetime, compared to one in 15 white women.“In poor black neighborhoods, what incarceration is to men, eviction is to women: a common yet consequential event that pushes families deeper below the poverty line,” Desmond said in a statement. “Poor black men are locked up; poor black women are locked out.”Challenges to employment after imprisonment incite movement to change application process
A simple check mark stands between thousands of ex-convicts and their access to employment across the country, but Wisconsin may join Read…Desmond said his book attempts to answer whether neighborhoods with more evictions have more violent crime the following year.Through his research in Milwaukee, Desmond found this to be the case. Eviction and incarceration do not just impact individuals, but have consequences on communities as a whole.When neighbors work together they can drive down crime in their community and organize to address problems, Desmond said. But many neighbors remain strangers due to housing instability and the power of community becomes diluted.“Eviction really threatens the social fabric of a community,” Desmond said. “We don’t let those communities reach their full potential. If we want more community stability, if we want more community engagement, we need fewer evictions.”In photos: A look into wreckage one month after Milwaukee riots
Violent protests erupted in Milwaukee nearly a month ago after a Milwaukee Police Department officer shot and killed a black Read…MARISSA HAEGELE/The Badger HeraldIt is important to place the recent riots in a broad historical and sociological context, Desmond said, and the lack of affordable housing and the history of housing instability is part of that context.Taylor believes the issue of eviction in Milwaukee is linked to the high rate of incarceration because when one person is incarcerated part of a household’s income is taken away and the burden of paying rent then falls on a single income.Taylor said traits like high incarceration rates, low literacy rates, high unemployment rates and infant mortality rates comparable to third world countries make Milwaukee “own the label of the worst place in the nation to raise a black child.”Taylor said the problems persist because they are happening to the “economically poor who are voiceless.”“We have to own what our truth is,” she said. “We are the most segregated city in the nation. We have some of the greatest disparities that exist in the nation.”Eviction is so under-researched across the country that basic questions about the topic don’t have answers yet, including whether Madison’s eviction rates are comparable to Milwaukee’s, Desmond said.While Desmond was living in Milwaukee and listening to tenants’ experiences with eviction, he was also conducting a study that collected and analyzed years of statistical data about poverty, housing and displacement.“Evictions, which used to be rare in this country and draw crowds, have become a normal and regular part of living below the poverty line.”
Matthew DesmondOften, landlords don’t make their evictions legal because it requires getting a lawyer and the legal process takes time, Smeeding said.Legally, a tenant in Wisconsin can only be forced to leave their home after a court date where the judge rules in the landlord’s favor, according to the Tenant Resource Center’s website. Landlords cannot change locks or remove a tenant’s belongings and a sheriff is the only person who can physically remove a tenant from a property.Landlords go about illegally evicting tenants in two ways, Smeeding said.“A good landlord will say, ‘I’ll give you a hundred bucks to be out by the end of the week,’” Smeeding said. “A bad landlord will say, ‘If you’re not out by the end of the week, I’m gonna unscrew your front door.’”Desmond’s study of Milwaukee encompassed both legal and illegal evictions. Because so many evictions happen illegally, it is difficult to find true eviction data on cities across the country.Desmond has recently examined eviction data in Cleveland, Kansas City, Missouri, Chicago and New York City. National eviction data shows that renters in more than 2.8 million homes think they’ll be evicted soon, Desmond said.“The kinds of numbers that we saw in Milwaukee are sadly the kind of numbers we’re seeing in other cities,” Desmond said. “And it means that if we want more family stability we have to have fewer evictions.”According to Desmond’s research, most Americans spend 30 percent of their income on housing. But the majority of poor renting families spend more than half of their income on housing. At least one in four of those families spend more than 70 percent of their income on housing.“Evictions, which used to be rare in this country and draw crowds, have become a normal and regular part of living below the poverty line,” Desmond said.Public housing helps combat eviction and housing instability to an extent, because landlords are guaranteed their rent will get paid, Smeeding said. In public housing, a tenant’s rent is consistently 30 percent of their current income, he said.Finding public housing in a “less concentrated poverty area” improves living conditions for children and improves opportunities for parents as well, Smeeding said.Unfortunately, there are not enough public housing vouchers for everyone that needs one, Smeeding said. For every four or five people who are eligible for a public housing unit, there is one unit available, he said.“We have to come to terms with both the promise and the peril of a city like Milwaukee,” Desmond said. “That kind of dual face comes to characterize the city and captures the texture of America and that should give us hope.”","Locked up and locked out: Milwaukee struggles with incarceration, eviction",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2014/01/21/pussy-eating-james-deen-don-jon-sex-events-2013/,"Jan 21, 2014","Another year has come and gone. It’s around this time I like to reflect on the stand out moments of all things sex-related that had us a-titter with our panties in a bunch.A lot of stuff went down — straight people got Tinder, Miley Cyrus twerked on everything, Carlos Danger showed us the tip and same-sex marriage got an endorsement from the commander-in-chief, to name just a few. Here is your year in review from one sex-obsessed pop culture junkie and some of my predictions for 2014.FAVORITE SEX EVENTS OF 2013:Pussy eatingAccording to my precise calculations, there was exponentially more media mention of cunnilingus in 2013 than the year previous. Actor Michael Douglas came out as a lifetime muff-diver, claiming his oral cancer was caused by an accumulation of going down on women (unlikely, but possible). Shout out to both oral pleasure and HPV prevention awareness!Among other amazing things the year gave us: Netflix’s original series “Orange is the New Black” featured a devilish shot of Natasha Lyonne peaking up from between the legs of a fellow inmate in the show’s second shower sex scene. Cannes Film Festival favorite “Blue is the Warmest Color” included an eyebrow-raising seven-minute lesbian lovers scene, filled to the brim with pussy eating, although I’m still not convinced of its authenticity. Evan Rachel Wood tore the MPAA a new asshole for editing out her oral sex scene in “Charlie Countryman.”Even fucking Cosmo commissioned a halfway decent piece on cunnilingus for a change. And who can forget crack-smoking-Toronto-mayor’s  assertion that he’s “got more than enough [PUSSAY] to eat at home.” That Canadian accent just makes it all the more endearing.James DeenI was a megafan of every project porn’s boy-next-door James Deen touched this year. Mr. Deen got into the sex toy business, won like a gazillian of awards for his hot work, became a director in his own right, stepped out with his gorgeous lady Stoya to complete porn’s perfect pairing and created quite a stir by speaking at a sociology class at Pasadena City College. He also got political with porn in his activism work against California’s Measure B condom law and became an unlikely advocate for safer sex.He made annoying-as-shit “Back Door Teen Mom” Farrah Abraham squirt all over herself with that glorious cock of his and even had time to stop by the University of Wisconsin campus in April. The only thing that could have made James Deen’s year (and mine) any better would have been being cast as Christian Grey for the film adaption of “Fifty Shades of Grey.” ROBBED, I TELL YOU!Don JonJoseph Gordon-Levitt’s directorial debut “Don Jon” introduced mainstream moviegoers to an incognito feminist agenda. Anyone who gives this movie a bad rap is clearly not smart enough or adept enough to have picked up on that. He’s not just trying to pout, stomp and whine to get you to stop objectifying women. He’s trying to tell you that taking porn literally is making you bad in bed, dipshits.I love this movie because it presents many lessons: A) ScarJo is, indeed, a dime; B) pornos, like rom-coms, are just as fake and toxic for matters of the heart and genitals; and C) the pornification of everything is causing widespread cognitive disconnect with our authentic sexualities.HERE’S TO HOPING, 2014:Male birth controlAs of yet, there still aren’t really any good options for male birth control out there. Vasectomies are costly and pretty much irreversible, pulling out is chance-y, condoms are not exactly preferable and the wet heat technique involves regularly tea bagging very hot water. The closest thing on the horizon is Vasalgel, a gel injection for the sperm tube to block those rascally little swimmers. It’s super-duper effective, cheap, quick, lasts for many years and is also reversible. We’ve known about the technology since the 70s, but clinical trials with human testing sure do take a long time.Officials are hopeful about putting the injection on the market by 2015, and I could not be more excited. Because you best believe the week that thing comes out, my man’s getting a shot to the dick. For the good of humanity and my endocrine system.Stop rape-supportive attitudesAmerica got plenty of learning opportunities to expand the conversation on consent, sexual assault, rape and alcohol-facilitated sexual assault in 2013. The horrific, high profile cases in Steubenville, Ohio and Maryville, Miss., captured national attention, the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized with new obligations for college campuses and even our own Badger Herald participated in the dialogue with its unconscionable letter to the editor by “He Who Shall Not Be Named.”Whadya say we make 2014 the year where Americans finally understand sexual consent and rape? I’m putting this one on the list not because it has anything to do with sex, but because it has precisely nothing to do with sex and therein lies the confusion. If I decide to hit you over the head with a frying pan, that ain’t called cooking. Let’s just all resolve to get on board at the same time. Ready? All together now!Better dick pics, pleaseSnapchat elevated regular old sexting to an art form this year. And dick pick senders better step up their game. Seriously, if I have to look at one more picture of a dull, lifeless flesh log, I might just consider reverting back to a flip phone.

Like any Wednesday, students were spread about the tables, couches and cubicles, doing homework or catching up with friends. The College Republicans office stood proudly in the middle of it all, bedecked in President Donald Trump 2020 and Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly campaign signs. Amidst the humming of socializing students and clacking keyboards, a recognizable hip hop beat emerged.“Yeah, yeah f— Donald Trump! Yeah, yeah f— Donald Trump!” rappers YG and Nipsey Hussle exclaimed from a cell phone speaker, as University of Wisconsin senior Jasmine Kiah rose from her table, papers in hand. While the song played, Kiah taped up signs over the windows of the College Republicans office. A smattering stated “Donald Trump is…” while the others finish the sentence — “racist,” “transphobic,” “sexist,” “ignorant,” to name a few. Kiah called her demonstration an act of freedom of speech. She said it was not meant to send a message to the University of Wisconsin, but to make herself feel better. That being said, she also noted that during her time at UW, she’s seen all of the prejudices her signs accused President Trump of.“I’ve been here for four years and all four years I’ve experienced racism. I’ve seen homophobia, transphobia, I’ve seen people not treated fairly, class institutional racism — all of that stuff. Everything that you could imagine, I’ve seen,” Kiah said to The Badger Herald in a previous statement. Kiah declined to be interviewed for this story.Signs outside of the College Republicans office. Molly Devore / The Badger HeraldBy the NumbersKiah’s experiences are corroborated by statistics. According to the 2016 Campus Climate Survey, nearly one-third of UW students mentioned at least one incident on the survey where they personally experienced or witnessed an act of hostile, harassing or intimidating behavior.Students of color, LGBTQ+ students, non-binary students and students with a disability were more likely to have been the target of the hostile, harassing or intimidating behavior they mention on the survey. Thirty-nine percent of students reporting incidents attributed their gender as the reason for this behavior. Thirty percent attributed the reason to their race. As a consequence of the survey results, UW is working on a series of goals and recommendations to promote a more inclusive environment for students of all backgrounds and identities. Some of these goals include ensuring an inclusive learning environment, promoting UW’s shared values of diversity and inclusion and promoting dialogue across differences to emphasize mutual respect and understanding, according to the 2016 Campus Climate Survey Task Force Report.But many feel certain speech — concerning politics or otherwise — is the antithesis of inclusivity, and creates negative psychological effects that are not conducive to an inclusive learning environment. “Every day I come past and I see this office, it makes me very upset, while we have … children at the border who are taken away from their parents, their parents are taken away from them and who is it because? It is because of Donald Trump,” Kiah said.The polarization of politics and the politicization of identity puts universities, especially public institutions, in a precarious predicament — not only to protect students’ free speech, but to protect free speech that some believe do not help facilitate an inclusive campus.The 2019 College Pulse Study, commissioned by the Knight Foundation, shows how college students struggle with protecting speech considered offensive and creating an inclusive campus. Though a majority of students do not favor restrictions on free speech, 41 percent of students draw the line at hate speech, which currently receives constitutional protection under the First Amendment. At the same time, 53 percent of students believe protecting free speech rights is more important than fostering inclusivity. Forty-six percent of students believe inclusivity is more important to a college campus than unrestricted speech. Of that 46 percent, students from historically underrepresented communities were more wary of unrestricted speech than white students, male students, Christian students, heterosexual students and cisgender students. On the MarginsFrom a national standpoint, 83 percent of Republican students believe the political and social climate of their campus prevents them from expressing their honest opinion, according to the College Pulse Study. UW, however, diverges from this trend. According to the latest campus climate data, conservative students reported feeling more welcome and more respected when compared to other students. Evan Karabas, UW junior and the Communications Director of the College Republicans of UW-Madison, noted that although conservative political opinions are not as prevalent on UW’s campus, the College Republicans view this as a challenge, not a setback.“We definitely are fighting an uphill battle and our views are underrepresented. We’re definitely a minority here,” Karabas said. “If we don’t reach out to students and share our perspective with them, they may never hear it going through school … Instead of feeling sorry for ourselves, we have to embrace the challenge.”The College Republicans took video of Kiah’s demonstration, which gained considerable traction on social media. The student group received an outpouring of support from other College Republicans chapters and enough publicity on UW’s campus to boost the group’s membership by a few heads, Karabas said. He also reported quite a few civil, productive discussions with students with opposing political views after the incident as well.As a self-described free speech absolutist, Karabas reiterated the incredible importance of free speech on college campuses as means of education and preparation for the world after college. There will always be ideas one can disagree with, Karabas said, but if students are not allowed to be exposed to such ideas, they won’t have a full preparation for post-university life.But for other students, dealing with offensive speech is a more frequent occurrence and it does not end cleanly, if at all. For Co-President of the UW chapter of National Association of Black Journalists and junior Enjoyiana Nururdin, dealing with offensive speech and having to educate her peers is something she’s dealt with her whole life — and will continue to do so after college.“… [Offensive speech] also teaches us resilience too often, especially when we get out into the professional world, there are things that people are going to say that are going to be problematic,” Nururdin said. “We can’t pull up our activist campus move and yell at everybody. They’re just people. Sometimes we just have to sit back and wait. Do we email someone in HR? Or do we wait and talk to someone and ask, ‘How do I approach this kind of thing?’ You really do have to pick and choose your battles.”And battles there have been — many this academic year in particular. In September 2019, two protesters stood on the corner of Park Street and University Avenue wearing nooses to raise awareness for climate change. The protesters said they were inspired by a similar protest in Europe, where protesters stood on blocks of ice with nooses around their necks. In the American context, however, nooses evoke a horrific history of lynching, where thousands of Black men and women were brutally murdered, adding several layers meaning to the expression that protesters said they had not considered beforehand.The protesters ended up leaving soon after the UW Police Department, the Division of Diversity, Equity and Educational Achievement and the Division of Student Life responded at the site of the protest. Afterwards, they participated in the university’s restorative justice program. “We would like the people we hurt to know that while we can’t truly understand the emotions you are feeling, we realize and are ashamed of the harm we have caused,” the protesters’ statement said. “Again, we are sorry and want you to know we are learning from this.”Learning ExperiencesThough speech and expression like the climate protest can have adverse effects on inclusivity on campus, they provide opportunities for students to determine what speech or expression is acceptable on campus and what is not. UW political science professor Howard Schweber cites this as one of the many reasons why free speech is important, especially on college campuses.“Part of the reason that we protect artistic speech, for example, or nonpolitical but opinionated speech is for people to try things out, try out ideas, try out opinions, explore people,” Schweber said. “There’s a value in exercising your own voice and there’s a value in changing that voice over time as you see fit and any kind of orthodoxy that limits expression gets in the way of that process.”Jonathan Rauch, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, even went as far as to argue that negative speech drives knowledge and scientific inquiry.“… You can’t make knowledge without dissent. If everyone agrees, then no one is asking the hard questions. And we become an echo chamber” Rauch said. “And we’ve actually seen that in some places on and off campus, in certain departments, certain subjects that would become very hard to have a critical conversation about. And you can’t do science that way. And without science you can’t do knowledge.”Rauch said minorities are the key beneficiaries of free speech and that efforts to protect minorities from offensive speech do more damage, in most cases, than the speech itself. Minorities have been oppressed for centuries through infantilization, Rauch said, and to protect minorities from offensive speech would only infantilize them further. Rauch did acknowledge this puts an undue burden on students of underrepresented backgrounds — the very same Nururdin touched on earlier — one he calls the “minority tax.” Rauch, who identifies as gay and Jewish and is known for his activism in favor of same-sex marriage, understands this burden. Rauch said, however, there are also several benefits.“My claim is that that’s a burden, but it’s also a privilege because minorities, people in marginalized places, people who are, have minority viewpoints, see the injustices and problems of society more clearly than people in the majority,” Rauch said. “And we have the privilege of being the first people to challenge those injustices and to change those injustices and this education process. Yeah, it’s a pain in the ass … but it also is a fantastic opportunity to make positive change in society and one that we should embrace and value.”Though Nururdin does not subscribe to this idea, she does enthusiastically take many opportunities to promote inclusive speech on campus.“I can’t tolerate some things and be okay with my life. For the next white man that comes along, [using offensive speech] may be okay,” Nururdin said. “But for the next Black woman that comes along, it won’t be.” InconclusiveFreedom of speech and an inclusive campus are not always in direct opposition to each other, though they do interact quite frequently. Schweber said universities are multi-faceted spaces. This makes drawing a balance between free speech and inclusivity even more difficult.“What makes the university so complicated in this context is that there’s several things at once. Basically small towns,” Schweber said. “So if you’re thinking of it as a town, it’s got lots of different kinds of spaces. It’s got public spaces and private spaces. It’s got classrooms and offices, it’s got Bascom Mall. And each of those presents different kinds of issues with free speech and academic freedom.”On the other hand, Rauch argues finding a balance between free speech and inclusivity is a false dilemma, as minority populations are the key beneficiaries of unregulated speech. “Trying to protect minorities from unsafe speech doesn’t help us. It hurts us,” Rauch said. “It means we can’t see where our opponents are. It means we’re not in a position to publicly refute them and push back, which is how we persuade people.”As the political culture becomes more polarized, and society advances to create new forms of expression and new places to share them in, there is no doubt UW will grapple with issues related to speech and inclusivity in the years to come. “People are still arguing over the First Amendment and the world, technology and opinions are constantly changing,” Nururdin said. “So we just have to be patient and know that change is going to come eventually.”","Complex Spaces: As political polarization, politicization of identity increases, UW attempts to balance free speech, inclusivity on campus",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/banter/2015/10/29/axe-in-the-stacks-the-story-behind-memorial-librarys-haunting-attack/,"Oct 29, 2015","Ever wondered why Memorial Library is the only library on campus that requires a Wiscard for entry?The reason behind this discrepancy dates back to a chilling incident that occurred in the Memorial Library stacks more than 30 years ago.Details of the following story were reported by The Capital Times in 1979.On May 2, 1979, 24-year-old graduate student Susan Oldenburg was working in one of Memorial Library’s typing rooms. She believed she was alone in the room.At 11:45 p.m., the lights in the room shut off briefly — an indication to remaining students the library was about to close. Oldenburg began to pack up her belongings, leaning over her bag to stow her books.“All of a sudden an arm came around my neck from behind,” Oldenburg told The Capital Times. “I screamed and the next thing I remember, whoever it was put their other hand in my mouth.” Her attacker began striking her repeatedly with a 3-foot-long fire axe, inflicting blow after blow onto Oldenburg’s head as she tried to protect herself.The attacker left abruptly, leaving Oldenburg bruised and bleeding on the floor of the typing room. Two students on the floor below had heard Oldenburg screaming during the assault, and rushed upstairs just as her attacker was running out of the room. The students chased after him, and joined by a third bystander, they managed to tackle and subdue the man.Police on scene said the attacker was identified as Eugene Devoe, a 25-year-old Madison resident with a considerable previous record of various charges including disorderly conduct, drug violations and criminal damage to property. In 1986, the Wisconsin State Journal reported that at age 18 he voluntarily committed himself to the Mendota Mental Health Institute, staying for around three months.Though she was severely wounded, Oldenburg recovered from the attack. She suffered a deep gash on her head, requiring 11 stitches, as well as a number of other minor wounds that left her with residual pain and headaches. The doctors who treated her told police officers that if Devoe had hit her any harder, she likely would have died.After his arrest, Devoe pleaded not guilty to the assault by reason of insanity. A jury ruled against him in court, and he received a sentence of five years in prison for the attack. His release did not end his criminal record, and he continued to amass a number of minor charges.One of these charges was another assault in 1997; he attacked another student with a stapler in the basement of the Teacher Education Building, according to the UW Alumni Association. He served a sentence of 11 years for this offense, and now lives outside Madison as a registered sex offender.Memorial Library
Herald archivesThe haunting attack served as a catalyst for major security upgrades to Memorial Library.The Wisconsin Library Bulletin details these improvements: Red emergency phones were installed throughout the stacks, physical security presence was increased and the staff began offering emergency whistles to all visitors.The most notable implementation was the reconfiguration of Memorial Library’s entrances and exits — these were reconfigured so that all visitors must go through a single entrance monitored by a staff member, and present a Wiscard or other identification for admission.

Eight hours of desperately trying to finish an organic chemistry assignment.Not a single problem finished.Lauren Van Hoof, a University of Wisconsin sophomore majoring in chemistry, said she hadn’t taken her Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder medication that day. Though her prescription for Adderall helps her focus, it also makes her lose her appetite, and she wanted to eat.When Van Hoof attempted to study, her ADHD got in the way.“I would try to start something … and my brain just wouldn’t process it, and I couldn’t even move on,” Van Hoof said.Cheating ourselves: UW lacks data on academic misconduct
Each year, more than 100 students at University of Wisconsin are caught and reported for academic misconduct. While this number may Read…Van Hoof relies on Adderall to help her concentrate. She takes it in low doses, as prescribed by her doctor.When midterms and finals come around, Van Hoof said she sees an uptick in the amount of students asking her to illegally sell them her ADHD medication, a request she always refuses. Van Hoof said it’s frustrating some students view Adderall and other stimulants as “magical smart drugs,” without fully understanding the implications of misusing these controlled substances.For some UW students, using stimulants to enhance academic performance is routine. Some use the drugs knowing fully well they do not have focus issues. Others use them to address their own concentration problems, though without a diagnosis.The illegal use of prescription stimulants is something many students at UW see as an acceptable part of campus culture.According to the spring 2015 National College Health Assessment survey, which contains the most recent data on prescription drug abuse, 7.9 percent of UW students surveyed said they used stimulants without a prescription in the past year.Prescription stimulants include lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate and amphetamine, which commonly go by the brand names Vyvanse, Ritalin and Adderall, Sarah Van Orman, University Health Services executive director, said in an email to The Badger Herald.[In] the general population, it tends to be more opioids and things like that, but as you can see on an academic college campus the stimulants really leapfrog ahead and become the most common prescription drug that is abused.
Angela Janis, director of psychiatry and interim co-director of mental health at UHSStimulants were used illegally more than any other prescription drug. The next most-common drug was painkillers, which 3 percent of students reported using.Angela Janis, director of psychiatry and interim co-director of mental health at UHS, said stimulant medications are the third most abused drug category at UW, below alcohol and marijuana.“[In] the general population, it tends to be more opioids and things like that, but as you can see on an academic college campus the stimulants really leapfrog ahead and become the most common prescription drug that is abused,” Janis said.Survey shows drug use among minors widespread
As much as 40 percent of minors in Wisconsin have tried some form of drugs or alcohol, according to a Read…While 7.9 percent of the student population may seem like a small number, UW students describe the misuse of Adderall and other stimulants as commonplace.Mark*, a UW junior majoring in economics, doesn’t have severe focus problems but has used prescription stimulants twice to help him improve his ACT score and once for a binge study session. He said it’s “just too easy” to get Adderall on campus. Using Adderall and other stimulants for studying, he said, is widely accepted since it’s not as damaging as other drugs.“On this campus it’s so prevalent that people don’t think anything of it,” Mark said. “The payoff is just way too good to not use it.”A 20mg Adderall pill usually sells for around $3-$5, according to student reports.
EMILY HAMER/The Badger HeraldMany students assume since prescription stimulants are safe when treating ADHD with the help of a doctor, using them illegally is automatically safe. Experts, however, agree using them without a prescription is dangerous.Two of the most common side effects are loss of appetite and insomnia, Janis said. Other serious side effects include increases in anxiety and cardiac issues. All of these side effects are worsened when taken in high doses that would not normally be prescribed.UHS strives to address needs of students with mental health concerns despite being understaffed, underfunded
A safety pin. Sharp enough to tear through fragile skin. Dull enough not to leave a mark. Strong enough to Read…When taken in high doses, prescription stimulants are more likely to cause panic attacks or even psychosis, Janis said. They can also cause your heart to race, which can be dangerous — especially for someone with a pre-existing cardiac issue.Dr. Jacob Behrens, medical director of Envision ADHD, a clinic specializing in treating and diagnosing ADHD in adults, pointed to one study, however, that found ADHD medications were not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in young and middle aged adults.All of the potential side effects are worsened when stimulants combine with alcohol, Janis said. There is also a greater danger of students getting alcohol poisoning because Adderall makes students more aware when they’re drunk, making it seem like they can drink more, she said.Nick*, a UW student majoring in mechanical engineering, has taken Adderall about 20 times for studying and partying. Nick said combining Adderall with alcohol is a “rush,” but can also have a “scary” blackout side effect.“You drink a lot more than you should,” Nick said. “Say you took X amount of shots, and you still remember it, so you … drink more.”Excessive alcohol use costs Wisconsin billions, experts call for culture change
With Wisconsin’s ranking of number one in the nation for binge drinking, the prevalence of alcohol in Wisconsin has yielded Read…But in the eyes of many students the benefits are worth the side effects.To mitigate risks, some students take Adderall in low doses similar to the amounts called for in prescriptions.In young, hyperactive middle class and above white males it’s extraordinarily highly diagnosed. It’s extremely under diagnosed in minorities, girls and women.
Dr. Jacob BehrensJessica*, a UW junior majoring in journalism who has previously written for The Badger Herald, said she uses Adderall because of trouble focusing on subjects she’s not interested in. She was diagnosed with ADHD in high school, but didn’t get a prescription because her mom read about the dangers of Adderall.During her first two years of college, Jessica said she used Adderall in low doses every week, around three days a week.Based on what she has seen on campus, Jessica thinks some students, like herself, are using Adderall to self-prescribe for what may be mild forms of ADHD. She said she thinks it would be unfair if she wasn’t able to get Adderall — a drug that helps her — just because she doesn’t have a doctor who can prescribe it.“I think a lot of people who [find] Adderall really helps them might actually have [ADHD],” Jessica said.KATIE COONEY/The Badger HeraldAlcohol culture affects students of color campus experience
With incidents of bigotry and hate popping up around the country since Donald Trump’s election as president, many members of Read…To be diagnosed with ADHD at UHS and all general practitioners, someone has to have exhibited symptoms of ADHD before age 12, Janis said.“Nowadays, most people, if they have ADHD, come to college with a diagnosis,” Janis said. “It’s rare that someone would have it missed and it only be brought about or noticed when they come to college.”Janis said UHS has a “robust protocol” for diagnosing ADHD when a previous diagnosis doesn’t exist. This includes gathering teacher report cards and doing in-depth neuropsychic testing into memory and IQ.Behrens said one of the challenges the medical community faces is ADHD medications being prescribed too easily, then getting out on “the black market.”A 2011 study by the Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience found symptoms of ADHD can be easily feigned, so students can get a prescription for Adderall without actually having ADHD.While this is a serious issue, Behrens said the fear of overdiagnosis leads some people who struggle with ADHD to be afraid to seek treatment.“In young, hyperactive middle class and above white males it’s extraordinarily highly diagnosed,” Behrens said. “It’s extremely under diagnosed in minorities, girls and women.”For the ADHD inattentive subtype, where hyperactivity is not present, it is less obvious someone may have ADHD because their symptoms don’t draw attention. Behrens said intelligence often masks ADHD symptoms in middle school and high school because students retain enough information to pass tests and get through high school.This changes when students get to college because they have heavier workloads and less structure, Behrens said.“It’s more than understandable to see why it starts to become very much unmasked when people move to college,” Behrens said.Wisconsin drug overdoses on the rise
In the past decade, drug overdoses have been on the rise in Wisconsin due to a higher prevalence and easy access to Read…Janis, however, said many students who experience concentration problems assume they have ADHD and start taking Adderall, without considering other potential causes. More common causes include poor sleep habits, depression, anxiety, marijuana use or excess alcohol use, Janis said. If it’s anxiety or poor sleep habits, taking Adderall makes it worse.Both Janis and Behrens agree students taking stimulants in an uncontrolled setting without a doctor is concerning.Will Chapman, assistant director of the UW Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, said one of the most concerning aspects is the acceptance of nonmedical prescription drug use as a “normalized” or “tolerable” behavior.Overall, Chapman said the misuse of Adderall and other prescription drugs is an underreported issue to the student conduct office, something he wishes would change.I’m not saying that we want to expel every student that misuses prescription drugs, but we do want to have the opportunity to intervene with them to help them understand the impact.
Will Chapman, assistant director of the UW Office of Student Conduct and Community StandardsDarcy Wittberger, spokesperson for the UW Division of Student Life, said in an email to The Badger Herald that there were only three cases in “the last several years” where Adderall was confiscated from a student without a prescription.The UW Police Department comes in contact with possession of illegal stimulants infrequently, UWPD Lt. of Investigative Services Brent Plisch said. This isn’t because of inattentiveness, but because it is a hard crime to detect.Plisch said most cases where UWPD comes into contact with a student who is using or is in possession of Adderall, Ritalin or Vyvanse occurs when something else drew officers to that location.Anecdotally, Plisch said most cases result in probation. In the worst case scenario, since Adderall, Ritalin and Vyvanse are Schedule II narcotics, illegal possession could result in jail time or a felony. Under UW rules, possession of Adderall or other prescription drugs without a prescription falls under the nonacademic misconduct policy, and could result in expulsion.“I’m not saying that we want to expel every student that misuses prescription drugs, but we do want to have the opportunity to intervene with them to help them understand the impact,” Chapman said.Mental health a high priority for UHS in upcoming budget
One day after Gov. Scott Walker announced a state budget that would potentially affect how the group allocates fees, the Student Service Read…Students who “cheat the system” and use these academic enhancers, do a “disservice” to themselves and their peers, Chapman said. If a student knows of someone who is misusing prescription drugs, Chapman encouraged the use of the Med Drop location on Monroe Street to dispose of the substances properly.Janis said using stimulants as study aides puts students who struggle with ADHD and students who do not want to use illegal drugs at a disadvantage. When used nonmedically, stimulants are essentially “academic steroids.”Van Hoof said when students use ADHD medications as study drugs it trivializes her symptoms. It makes it seem like she uses Adderall to get ahead in school or that her learning disorder is “fake.”Caleb Sindic, a UW junior majoring in biochemistry who has ADHD, said he doesn’t think other students using stimulants puts him at an academic disadvantage, but he does get frustrated with students who don’t fully understand ADHD medications. He said students don’t know about the side effects and proper dosage.Craig Berridge, UW psychology professor and expert of neuropharmacology, said since ADHD patients have impaired cognitive function, stimulants have a greater impact on them, and it’s unclear how much of an effect stimulants would have on a healthy, well-rested UW student.Studies show the nonmedical use of prescription stimulants doesn’t actually improve students’ GPAs, Behrens said.Both Nick and Mark said they’re not sure if Adderall helps them focus, or if it’s a placebo effect.Jessica, however, said Adderall helps one focus, regardless of ADHD diagnosis.When students approach Sindic to try to get his ADHD medication, Sindic said he warns them of the side effects and pushes them to see that Adderall is a drug they don’t want to be taking.But while Sindic doesn’t think students should misuse Adderall, he said they should have the legal right to access it. Sindic said legalization of the stimulants would lead to greater education about how the drugs work.“When someone without ADHD is using this … fundamentally I kind of consider it to be kind of like coffee,” Sindic said. “It is kind of like caffeine … where it just kind of boosts your confidence, your focus.”Student finance committee discusses expanding amenities, staffing at UHS
In an effort to improve mental health care services, the Student Services Finance Committee discussed possible adjustments to the budget plan Read…Berridge said he thinks it’s weird society doesn’t have a problem with people using caffeine to enhance cognitive performance, but people have ethical concerns when it comes to Adderall. If stimulants were legal and didn’t carry more risks than caffeine, he doesn’t think there would be a problem.But stimulants do carry significantly more risk than caffeine, Berridge added.The misuse of prescription stimulants is one symptom of a larger problem: the immense pressure for students to succeed.It’s kind of putting a band-aid on it rather than figuring out a better way to get all your work done.
NickIn the spring 2015 NHCA survey, anxiety and stress impacted a student’s academic performance the most, more than alcohol use and depression. For anxiety, 22.2 percent of students said it was an impact, and 30.6 percent of students said stress was an impact.Nick said, for him, Adderall is essentially hard work, organization and time management in a pill.“It’s kind of putting a band-aid on it rather than figuring out a better way to get all your work done,” Nick said.Chapman said there are a number of services to help students improve their study habits and talk about prescription drug dependency or abuse like drop-in tutoring sessions. A program through Greater University Tutoring Service targets improvements on study skills.Student organizations like Live Free host meetings designed to help students overcome all substance abuse, including prescription drug dependency or addiction, Carter Kofman, spokesperson for Live Free, said in an email to The Badger Herald.Janis said UHS is also a confidential place for students to come for advice on better stress management or alternatives to Adderall.Some students still feel like the university isn’t doing enough to inform students about ADHD medications. Sindic said he thinks the university would benefit from more programs educating students about ADHD, ADHD medications and alternatives. There is currently not a program dedicated to this mission specifically.Still, Sindic said he thinks students should re-evaluate whether or not they need stimulants.“People aren’t learning how to manage their lives,” Sindic said. “You could go in [to UHS] and say ‘I think I have ADHD’ and then they tell you, here are a bunch of methods that you could use to mitigate these ADHD symptoms that don’t involve taking pills. … There are alternatives.”*Names have been changed to protect the privacy of sources who have engaged in illegal activities.Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Dr. Jacob Behrens was the assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health, but Behrens no longer works there.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/11/08/madison-community-reacts-to-hate-speech-on-campus-following-halloween-costume-controversy/,"Nov 8, 2016","A controversial free speech dilemma has bubbled up on the University of Wisconsin campus after two people attending a Badger football game over Halloween weekend wore racially charged costumes and were not ejected from the game.One of the people was dressed as Donald Trump and the other President Barack Obama wearing a noose and dressed in prison garb.Attendees alerted UW police and athletic officials and the authorities asked the person wearing the costume to remove the noose. The people were not seated in the student section and officials do not know if they were associated with UW.Football fan in President Obama mask exercising freedom of speech, chancellor says
A fan in a mask of President Barack Obama with a noose around their neck at the Badger’s football game Read…Donald Downs, a retired UW political science professor and free speech law expert, said the costume is “sort of a grey area” when it comes to free speech.“Hanging in effigy” has historically been used symbolically to show constituents’ displeasure with a political or public figure’s time in office, Downs said. But the fact that Barack Obama is black brings in the history of lynching, Downs said.Downs said the overall message sent could be construed as a political statement, racially motivated sentiment or some combination of the two.But Downs said the costume would ultimately fall under speech that’s protected from the law.“If they wore a costume like that around town or on the street corner, that’s going to be protected speech, unless they confront somebody with it, face to face in a threatening manner, in which case it could be construed as a threat,” Downs said.Ricardo Rangel, a UW junior and member of the Multicultural Greek Council, said he didn’t think it was correct to call the incident free speech because he views it as an act of terror.Rangel said he was frustrated the administration and authorities pursued the incident as free speech without fully understanding its historical context.“They didn’t do anything to help the people of color who have fear for their own lives here because of all these actions,” Rangel said.Hate speech is not expressly excluded from free speech protection of the First Amendment, Downs said. Only speech like threats, child pornography and “fighting words” — words likely to draw someone into a fight — are unprotected. Hate speech alone may be protected, but hate speech aimed at a specific person, for example Obama, would not necessarily be.But because the football game was a special university event and not a public venue, the university could restrict certain activities and speech. Downs said the noose fit into a category the university could ban, but was still an ambiguous symbol.Downs said the university found a middle ground in the tension between protecting free speech and preventing hate speech by asking the person to remove the noose.The day following the incident, UW Chancellor Rebecca Blank said in a statement the political message, though hateful, constituted free speech.“As offensive as this costume was, I believe our university must resist the desire to outlaw forms of speech and political dissent with which we disagree,” Blank said in the statement.Blank also said the incident is a further reminder more work needs to be done to build a stronger, more inclusive community.At a Faculty Senate meeting Monday, Blank further apologized for the university’s handling of the incident, announcing UW has since revoked the attendees’ season tickets. UW will also unveil new carry in policies by the end of the week.UW Athletics also said in a statement while they consider the costume “repugnant,” the costumes are still an exercise of the individuals’ free speech.exercising your 1st amendment rts doesn't require good taste. Showin up #Badger in Obama mask & a noose around his neck is a prime example.— Sue Riseling (@IACLEAEXEC) October 30, 2016In a letter to Blank, Associated Students of Madison Chair Carmen Goséy and three other ASM members said they disapproved of initial statements from UW Athletics addressing the incident.“This image incites violence and carries a dark history of oppression and terrorization from white supremacist groups,” they said in the letter. “This is hate speech that continues to ostracize Black people on campus, instill fear, and threaten safety.”The representatives criticized the university for claiming to support diversity and inclusivity but choosing “not to uphold these values at a time of need.” They said short-term diversity initiatives were not enough to stand in for more sustained efforts.Blank and Athletic Director Barry Alvarez said in a later statement Camp Randall will review its policies “with the goal of ensuring that symbols of this type are not displayed in our stadium again.”UW reviews Camp Randall policies after public backlash over Halloween incident
After a fan wore a costume depicting President Barack Obama with a noose tied around the neck at Saturday’s football Read…Aria Bryan, a UW junior and member of the Black Student Union, Wunk Sheek — an organization for students of indigenous background — and Mixed Race Student Union, said she was initially confused when she heard about the costume incident.“Mentally, I was trying to get around the fact that this was a racially-charged costume,” Bryan said. “I was just kind of confused and trying to process what angle this was coming from.”Bryan said when she fully understood the implications of the costume, she felt anger and shock.She said she appreciated the university’s efforts to look forward and make sure oppressive events don’t go unpunished.“It’s good that they’re taking steps toward ensuring this doesn’t happen again in the future, but I want them to do more with regards to this specific case, because I don’t want there to be a set precedent that people can get away with things like this,” Bryan said.But Bryan said as a Native American and African American student, she is no stranger to seeing culturally offensive images for Halloween.It is disheartening to still see racial bias after eight years of what was supposed to be change under the country’s first African American president, Bryan said. She said the costume incident is not reflective of the Madison community, but of a society that needs to be more racially and historically aware.“I’m not naive enough to think that it doesn’t happen,” Bryan said. “I hope that students and teachers and anyone that’s been affected really understand that there’s a huge difference in trying to make a political statement or trying to make a joke or funny costume than completely insulting somebody’s identity.”Vershawn Hansen, a UW freshman and first year ambassador for Wisconsin Black Student Union, said when he saw Blank’s statement he didn’t understand her interpretation of free speech.“As a freshman, I was shocked that it was handled that way,” Hansen said. “It almost … covered up and swept under the rug by calling this free speech.”Hansen said as a member of the black community, he doesn’t consider Blank an ally at the moment. But he appreciated the national spotlight on the incident as a way to encourage action on the part of the institution.Hoyon Mephokee, a UW senior, former Asian American Student Union president and current senior advisor, said the university hasn’t taken the incident as seriously as he would have hoped.“It’s not just this event,” Mephokee said. “I think it reflects a trend that many people of color and other socially or economically disadvantaged people feel that their very legitimate struggles and concerns aren’t being taken seriously by the administration.”Mephokee said students are leading much of the action to counter these types of incidents, including cultural competency initiatives. He said it is not enough for the administration to issue statement after statement when events like this occur.“I’m not saying the administration isn’t taking any action,” Mephokee said. “The administration certainly is responding to these events, as are students on ASM and other leadership positions. I just think that the fact we’re seeing this sort of behavior continue — it’s indicative that clearly more can be done.”Programs to encourage better cultural understanding could be effective given enough time and focus, Mephokee said. He said while changing Camp Randall’s costume policies will help, it alone won’t get to the heart of the problem.Rangel said the university was more concerned with preserving its reputation than the lives of students on campus.He said it is frustrating to deal with these issues on a day-to-day basis and all minorities see and have a voice in these situations.“Racism is racism, regardless of what your ethnicity is,” Rangel said. “We should all be united in order to fight racism.”JULIA KAMPF/The Badger HeraldUW officials respond to swastika ‘bias incident’ in campus dorm

https://badgerherald.com/features/2018/04/03/despite-broader-push-to-improve-campus-climate-deaf-students-are-consistently-erased-excluded-silenced/,"Apr 3, 2018","It was one of many times that Catherine Palm was acutely aware of being a Deaf student in a hearing world.The audio on a video her professor wanted to play wasn’t working. The captions were still available, though, so her professor started the clip without sound.Palm breathed a sigh a relief. Professors often forget to turn on the captions when playing videos. This time, she’d be able to understand the content for her class.But mere seconds into the video, Palm’s classmates started complaining. The captions were too fast. They blocked the screen. They couldn’t see. It was too annoying to read. Palm’s professor stopped the video. He said he’d fix the audio so they could listen to it for homework.Palm went numb. Then her pulse started to rise.She’s spent her whole life asking for captions, hoping there would be captions, feeling relief when they’re provided and feeling frustration when they’re not.“That is how easily hearing people gave up,” Palm said. “They got their way because they could: Hearing privilege.”For deaf and hard of hearing students at the University of Wisconsin, these situations — where hearing students lack knowledge and understanding of Deaf experiences — are commonplace and can lead to microaggressions, accommodation refusals and sometimes discrimination.And though unintentional, the indifference to Deaf culture permeates through campus. American Sign Language courses are not regularly offered. Deaf experiences aren’t included in the diversity conversation. Deaf culture is not a prominent part of UW’s history. And the voices of Deaf students are often silenced.The problem starts with a lack of knowledge.UW freshman Joon Jang, a hard of hearing student who has hearing aids, said students expect there to be diversity in terms of race or backgrounds when they come to UW, but they don’t expect to see a range of physical accommodation needs.“I wish people were more aware that … hearing disabilities exist,” Jang said.“I’ve traveled to other countries. I communicate with a blind person. They’re always shocked at the things that I can do. It’s just that they don’t know what I can do.”
Catherine PalmAlyssa Wciorka, a sophomore majoring in psychology and communication sciences and disorders, said people don’t realize there is a spectrum of Deaf individuals.Hearing loss can range from slight to full loss, and some use hearing aids or cochlear implants for assistance. Wciorka was diagnosed with severe and profound hearing loss when she was one. At age two, she started using cochlear implants.“A lot of people don’t know about degrees of deafness,” Wciorka said. “They don’t understand that I can hear because of my cochlear implants.”Deaf actor, activist Nyle DiMarco breaks barriers in hearing world
As part of the ongoing Distinguished Lecture Series, Wisconsin Union Directorate and the McBurney Disability Resource Center hosted deaf actor Read…Her cochlea — the portion of the inner ear that receives sound vibrations — doesn’t function properly, so the implant replaced parts of it. An external microphone and sound processor, which sits in Wciorka’s ear, sends signals to the internal implant. This allows her to hear sound that is “very, very degraded” — about 16 electrodes compared to the thousands of channels you get with natural hearing.Others have full hearing loss and do not use cochlear implants, using sign language to communicate. These individuals are known as culturally Deaf, and they have varying levels of integration with the hearing world.Some know sign but still hang out with hearing individuals. Others interact primarily with others who are culturally Deaf.Many hearing people have never met a Deaf person, and make assumptions about what they don’t know. One of the most pervasive misconceptions about deaf and hard of hearing people is that they are incapable.Palm said people think she can’t drive or read since she is deaf.“I’ve traveled to other countries. I communicate with a blind person,” Palm said. “They’re always shocked at the things that I can do. It’s just that they don’t know what I can do.”Kate Lewandowski, McBurney’s accommodation specialist for deaf and hard of hearing students, said students commonly tell her about being passed over in class or during group projects because it’s assumed that they can’t participate. Professors also frequently forget to turn on captions for videos.“For most Deaf individuals, they look at deafness as their identity … and there’s nothing wrong with us, we’re not disabled. But there are other individuals who look at us as disabled and that we need help or we can’t do things.”
Catherine PalmWciorka said her professors will sometimes talk to her captioner instead of her as if she can’t communicate on her own.“Deaf and dumb” is a perception many still hold about the deaf and hard of hearing community, Lewandowski said.UW senior Acheh Fonkem, a deaf student majoring in zoology, said some of her friends have made comments about her deafness like “see, even Acheh could hear that.” And if Fonkem can’t catch everything in a conversation right away, sometimes people will just give up on her.For Lewandowski, there have been multiple times where restaurant employees will bring her a menu in braille, assuming that she can’t read. She’s also had airport security bring her a wheelchair after a flight, as if being Deaf means she has issues walking.WHY DO PEOPLE THINK DEAF PEOPLE NEED BRAILLE pic.twitter.com/mpx7tEVfeU— Nyle DiMarco (@NyleDiMarco) March 30, 2018Hearing people also assume that if a Deaf person can’t speak orally or if they have a Deaf accent, then they aren’t intelligent. Lewandowski’s husband, who is Deaf and has a pronounced Deaf accent when speaking, is often dismissed or talked to like a child.People make the same assumptions about those who can’t read lips, but lip reading takes a lot of in-depth training, which most deaf students don’t have, Palm said.Fonkem said people often talk louder, slower and over-enunciate when speaking to her. But Fonkem, Palm, Lewandowski and Jang said speaking louder doesn’t mean they’ll be able to hear someone better. Fonkem can’t hear, so talking louder is useless. Jang can hear people talking unless there’s a lot of background noise.McBurney students on campus
Eric Nooker and Kate Skarda are Deaf. The capital “D,” they point out, is the difference between Deaf culture and Read…Another common misunderstanding is that sign language is a disjointed or broken language.Katie Hustad, department chair of the communication sciences and disorders department, said ASL has its own rules, consistent word order that is unique from spoken English and is socially accepted by a community. ASL is its own vibrant language.“I like to open people’s minds and be like, ‘oh there’s a language that can be used with your hands,’” Fonkem said. “People get shocked about that, that it’s not just verbal language.”And along with the language, comes a rich and diverse culture.Fonkem said she’s still learning about Deaf culture, but “it’s beautiful.” When she meets someone who is Deaf it’s something they can bond over.Acheh Fonkem helps teach sign language to members of UW’s Sign Language Club.
Boya LiangThe Deaf community shares language, history, traditions and values, Lewandowski said. When Lewandowski’s within it, she doesn’t have to explain herself. She can talk freely with no barriers. She’s safe.Palm said being deaf is a part of who she is as a person.“For most Deaf individuals, they look at deafness as their identity … and there’s nothing wrong with us, we’re not disabled. But there are other individuals who look at us as disabled and that we need help or we can’t do things,” Palm said. “But we as a group feel that we’re fine. We have our language, we have our culture, our history, our events — just like other cultures have.”But on UW’s campus, Deaf culture is something that is “easily overlooked,” Lewandowski said.As UW seeks to improve its campus climate and promote diversity, Deaf culture is excluded from the conversation.“That should not be part of high school graduates minds, that I can’t go to Madison because they don’t seem very friendly to Deaf people.”
Acheh Fonkem“In general, people here are interested in other cultures,” Lewandoski said. “However, Deaf culture’s not something that is represented here on this campus, and I think a lot of that does have to do with the small group of students we have here.”Each semester, there are approximately 45 to 50 students who are Deaf or hard of hearing and enrolled at McBurney, Lewandowski said. Of those, less than five use sign language.Lewandowski said it’s important to have more representation of the Deaf community at UW, and that might come if campus was more supportive.When Fonkem first came to Madison, she was afraid it wouldn’t be very Deaf-friendly.“That should not be part of high school graduates minds, that I can’t go to Madison because they don’t seem very friendly to Deaf people,” Fonkem said.Lily Hansen, president of Sign Language Club on campus, said Deaf awareness week in September wasn’t shared or promoted on campus through the university’s websites or social media pages.And before Hansen started Sign Language Club three years ago, there was nothing.Members of Sign Language Club practice ASL
Boya LiangHansen tried to do a project on the history of deaf and hard of hearing individuals at UW, but there wasn’t enough information in the archives.“There’s literally nothing,” Hansen said. “The archivist said she couldn’t help me. So that’s pretty remarkable. And that’s not their fault. … There just isn’t anything out there.”In addition, the availability of ASL courses has been inconsistent. Historically, ASL I and ASL II classes were taught under the department of rehabilitation psychology and special education, but only in the summer and not every summer, student services coordinator Virginia Waddick said in an email to The Badger Herald.“We lack in [Deaf] history on campus because we haven’t created it.”
Lily HansenNow, ASL courses are housed in Hustad’s department: communication sciences and disorders, as a tool for therapists and audiologists to use with young children with communication delays.Hustad’s department will be offering ASL courses like these this summer, and hopefully in the future. She wishes UW could expand ASL courses into fall and spring semesters or have them count as a foreign language, but there are a lot of barriers.There are strict curriculum requirements for classes to count toward the foreign language requirement. Someone would have to create the curriculum, and it would go through a “massive set of reviews,” Hustad said. And they don’t have any faculty that can teach ASL. When they offer it in the summer, a community member teaches it.“We literally have no resources to create sign language sequence in our department,” Hustad said. “We would love to, but we can’t do it without money.”Hustad said she thinks student voices — both Deaf and hearing — could help them get the resources they need to offer ASL. She thinks campus would be supportive, it’s just a new concept.Though promoting Deaf culture can be unfamiliar territory for UW, there’ve been efforts to make improvements.This past January, model, actor and Deaf activist Nyle DiMarco came to campus to talk about his experience as a Deaf person for the Wisconsin Union Directorate’s Distinguished Lecture Series. WUD partnered with McBurney to host the lecture and organize an event where Deaf students from UW and all around Wisconsin could interact with DiMarco. He spoke about the importance of spreading awareness of Deaf culture at UW and throughout the world.Nyle DiMarco visited UW’s campus this past January.
ELLA GUO/The Badger Herald“When the Nyle event happened I was like, ‘I’m comfortable here,’” Fonkem said.He talked with students about how to overcome barriers in a hearing world, telling Fonkem to be assertive and make sure she has the accommodations she needs when applying for jobs.When Lewandowski was a UW student from 2006-09, UW hosted a comedian who did a show in ASL. But he was an interpreter and not deaf himself.“An actual Deaf person presenting — and to get that kind of response that we did from the Deaf community — that’s incredible,” Lewandowski said. “That’s never happened before.”To work toward bridging the gap between hearing and Deaf communities on campus, Hansen, a hearing student, dedicates her time to Sign Language Club. Hansen learned sign language in high school and started the club at UW during her sophomore year in 2015.Lily Hansen, president of Sign Language Club, signs with her fellow students.
Boya LiangHansen works with Fonkem and third-year graduate Phu Duong, a deaf student who uses cochlear implants and ASL, to lead weekly meetings. They teach ASL and Deaf culture to members and lead activities that help with signing.Hansen said during her time there, the club has impacted at least 200 people — something she hopes will grow.“We lack in [Deaf] history on campus because we haven’t created it,” Hansen said. “And so this club is paving a way to create history, hopefully.”Alongside these efforts, McBurney has provided accommodations for all deaf and hard of hearing students who need it. For classes, academic activities and clubs, they provide interpreters, real-time captioning, microphones for professors and other assistive listening devices.Duong said McBurney provides him with everything he needs to get an education. Jang said McBurney has been “excellent” in getting him the resources he needs.Still, outside of the accommodations and support that McBurney provides for students, other problems persist.While McBurney’s accommodations allow students to pursue academic goals, they don’t automatically provide accommodations for social events.“I think the biggest struggle is social isolation,” Duong said. “When you’re deaf you have to accept that that’s part of your norm.”“While the organization may not be intentionally malicious in denying sign language interpreting services, the result … is that it makes it much harder for Deaf people to succeed.”
Kate LewandowskiFonkem said she tries to plan out her entire semester to ensure she can get accommodations in advance for social events, but still cannot receive them sometimes. Campus organizations often deny her requests for accommodations due to money, lack of time or they simply don’t respond.Fonkem, Palm and Wciorka said they have wanted to see movies at The Marquee Cinema, but the WUD Film Committee always denies their requests to show a movie with captioning because hearing people don’t like it when the movies have captions.Captions are not only for Deaf people.When an actor mumbles, speaks in a heavy British accent, or is trying to make himself heard amidst a Michael Bay movie explosion scene, captions are there to make the dialogue crystal clear.https://t.co/MLBTfsswxe— Nyle DiMarco (@NyleDiMarco) February 24, 2018The Overture Center and First Wave have also denied some of Fonkem’s requests for accommodations.Another challenge is organizations are usually unprepared to accommodate. Fonkem usually has to direct organizations to McBurney because they aren’t used to getting requests.Lewandowski said it’s important for campus organizations, and those outside of campus, to have a budget ready for these requests. She said they should also include a tagline in advertisements for their events that says, “contact this person by this time if you need accommodations.”“While the organization may not be intentionally malicious in denying sign language interpreting services, the result from this lack of access is that it makes it much harder for Deaf people to succeed or navigate in predominantly hearing spaces,” Lewandowski said.And sometimes, resistance to accommodations can extend into the classroom.Jang said when he asked one professor to use a microphone that would transmit to his ear, the professor was resistant and questioned whether Jang was trying to record the lecture.While Wciorka has not experienced a professor being resistant to giving her accommodations, they frequently forget to turn on captioning for videos.“’Are you being resistant to it, or are you just ignorant?’ is one of the big things that I have to learn and understand with those professors,” Wciorka said.Across the spectrum of deaf experiences, deaf and hard of hearing students agree that they would like more awareness and understanding from the hearing community.“Start with having an open mind.”
Nyle DiMarcoFonkem hopes hearing students will take the initiative to become better informed about deaf experiences. Palm said she’d love to have more conversations with hearing students. Fonkem, Duong and Hansen hope more people will come to Sign Language Club. In addition to offering ASL courses, Fonkem said she’d like to see classes on Deaf studies as well.“If we can show that the university is more open-minded, willing to include more Deaf culture-related events or more classes, they can show that Deaf people can get a higher education here,” Fonkem said.Lewandowski said she hopes for more hearing students to be vulnerable and unafraid to ask Deaf students about their preferences. She wants to get the ASL program started and have students ask for a Deaf studies curriculum.For hearing students who may feel hesitant to connect with the Deaf community, DiMarco said they simply need to take steps to start learning.“I’d say start with having an open mind,” DiMarco said. “Take a Deaf studies class, I don’t know if they even offer that here at UW. Join a Deaf organization, find Deaf people here in Madison. Join them, learn from them and take it from there.”","Despite broader push to improve campus climate, Deaf students are consistently erased, excluded, silenced",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2014/12/01/i-watched-macaulay-culkin-sing-songs-about-pizza-to-a-sold-out-high-noon-saloon/,"Dec 1, 2014","My Sunday night at the High Noon Saloon was one of the strangest and cheesiest full-circle experiences of my life.As a child, I would frequently watch a young Macaulay Culkin eat pizza and attempt to murder burglars in the “Home Alone” films. My five-year-old self thought the child actor’s reckless consumption of junk food in the absence of parental units was a rousing act of rebellion. In the mid-90s, Macaulay Culkin was an inspiration to me. He was a symbol of youthful vitality. He proved that children can overcome adult oppression simply by dropping bricks, power tools and large bags of cement mix onto the heads of their middle-aged oppressors.It is now 2014. I am 21 years old. I haven’t thought of Macaulay Culkin in years. But Sunday night, I found myself watching a 34-year-old Culkin sing songs about pizza to a sold-out crowd at the High Noon Saloon. He had brought his band The Pizza Underground — a group that performs pizza-themed covers of Velvet Underground songs — to Madison for a nearly hour-long set dedicated to all things pizza. The band shared the headlining spot with Har Mar Superstar, but the weird vibes began with openers Tickle Torture and Candy Boys, who set the tone for the entire concert.Tickle Torture made it quickly apparent that his goal as a musical artist is to be as sexual as possible. His sex-funk mixed Flea-like slap bass and primal screams, slathering them with lush, psychedelic synthesizers. It was an all-out sensory assault. Video projected behind the musicians literally featured “tickle torture.” Lead singer Elliott Kozel wore only a thong and mask, both gold-sequined. Six dancers covered in gold paint and wearing only underwear flanked Kozel, making out with him and grinding against him throughout. Lines like “Fuck me with the lights on” and “C’mon baby, take my advice / If you’re lonely let me fuck you twice” rang through the small venue as Kozel turned a fog machine into a phallic symbol. It was like watching some sort of strange erotica only found in the darkest bowels of the Internet: terrifying, titillating and impossible to look away from.It was time for the second act. “The sweetest boy band ever — Candy Boys!” announced the group’s hypeman. Two men wearing tight-fitting green and yellow tank tops that read “CANDY” and “BOYS,” respectively, both took the stage and started singing, “How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Candy Boy?” Both men licked lollipops and handed out candy bars to the audience. Their backing instrumentals seemed to come from an iPod hooked up to an amplifier; at the end of every song, the group would press a button and the next cheesy instrumental would pound through the High Noon’s speakers. The group’s lyrics were of an almost transcendental literary quality: “There’s nothing that candy can’t fix,” “We love candy more than you” and “My sugar high’s high, my lows are rough.” It was awe-inspiring. It was art.And then the guy who grew famous for slapping aftershave on his face took the stage. Macaulay Culkin wore sunglasses and a leather jacket, his long, blonde hair looking as greasy as the slices of Ian’s Pizza the band handed out to the crowd.“You kids like pizza?” Culkin asked the crowd. “You like songs about pizza? ‘Cause the hamburger guys are across the street!” This was about as inspired as the banter would get.The band launched right into its music — medleys of Velvet Underground/Lou Reed/Nico tunes replaced with pizza-themed lyrics. Songs included “Papa John Says,” “I’m Waiting for Delivery Man,” “All the Pizza Parties” and “Take a Bite of the Wild Slice.” The five-piece band brought a tender earnestness to the literally cheesy lyrics, especially on songs like “Cheese Days:” “I’ve been out walking / I don’t do too much toppings these days / Cheeeeeeeeese days…”The band’s between-song banter was predictably awkward. In between sips of High Life, Culkin made quips about hepatitis (??) and about how “fucking awesome” pizza is. “Writing original music is for chumps!” one band member shouted. At one point, a band member said, “We’re using metaphors as a road to truth,” to which Culkin responded, “Is that what it is? I thought we were just singing about pizza.” The word “bizarre” does not do justice to the scene.Har Mar Superstar hit the stage following The Pizza Underground. Compared with the previous acts, his music and stage presence seemed so…normal. His Jay Sherman-like appearance and lightweight R&B were just too straight-faced to excite the crowd that had been put through three of the strangest acts most of them had probably ever seen. Har Mar Superstar is known for his ability to get crowds dancing. In this regard, he failed miserably. At the end of the night, however, it wasn’t Har Mar Superstar who the crowd was talking about; it was Culkin and his pizza cronies.Seeing a person who I grew up watching on TV singing about pizza in a bar in Wisconsin was plainly surreal. For the rest of his life, Culkin will never actually have to work. He’s rolling in money from the films that catapulted him to fame in the early 1990s. He comes from wealth, so he can do things like tour the country and half-assedly sing songs about pizza. My friend remarked to me during the show that The Pizza Underground should actually be called “White Privilege: The Band.” It was white privilege we were seeing, undoubtedly, but it was also celebrity privilege. The show was a testament to the power of money and fame: If you have enough of these things, you can really do whatever the hell you want, even if doing what you want means singing songs about pizza.But the concert also showed that there’s a certain charm to being cheerfully obsessed with something so banal. For Culkin, that obsession is with pepperoni, triple cheese and no anchovies, please. There’s a long list of former child stars whose lives have spiraled into an orgy of drugs and alcohol — necessary byproducts of their wealth — so it’s nice to see Culkin putting his time and energy into something as harmless as pizza. It’s humbling that a celebrity can, just like us plebeians, get really, really excited about something as normal as a delicious slice of cheese pizza.",I watched Macaulay Culkin sing songs about pizza to a sold-out High Noon Saloon,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2017/09/12/madison-based-website-makes-transportation-network-companies-transparent-safe/,"Sep 12, 2017","In an effort to make transportation network companies, such as Uber and Lyft, safer for riders, Justin La Plante, a former Madison taxi driver created Ride Safe World, a website that gives riders information on whether their driver has a criminal record.Ride Safe World is a non-profit organization dedicated to transportation safety and transportation labor ethics. The safety of the customers, drivers and general public is La Plante’s top priority, he said.Currently, there are two proposed senate bills that would hold transportation network companies, such as Uber and Lyft to the same standard as traditional transportation companies.Senate bills 181 and 182, proposed by Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, would hold TNC’s, such as Uber and Lyft, to the same standard as PTC’s, such as taxi and limousines.SB 181 stated cities with a population of 10,000 or more people are permitted to enforce local regulations on TNCs, their drivers and the drivers’ vehicles.The second bill would require TNC’s to establish a complaint procedure for discriminatory or fraudulent behavior toward passengers.Larson said TNC’s lack proper insurance, exploit gig-economy drivers and doesn’t give security for passengers by having little-to-no background checks of the drivers.PTC’s in attendance included many taxi drivers from the midwest who vehemently voiced their support of these bills to add more transparency to the TNC industry.Proposed bills seek to hold ride sharing companies, taxi companies to same standard
A proposed bill in the Wisconsin State Legislature would hold transportation network companies and public transportation companies to the same standards. Read…La Plante’s website gives transparency to ridesharing companies, he said.The website allows the general public to enter a ride share license plate number which then informs the user if their driver has a criminal background and if the vehicle is properly insured, La Plante said.It does not give detailed information about the driver. The site also does not report plate numbers, rather it only looks them up, La Plante said.“We only list felons if they committed dangerous crimes involving assault or major traffic violations that would have definitely barred them from obtaining employment with any vetted commercial transportation provider,” La Plante said.The website gathers its information on Records Finder, a public records search site, and through research and knowledge from experience in the industry, La Plante said.According to their findings, in the past two years, Ride Safe World has found 144 Uber and Lyft drivers that either have criminal backgrounds, do not have verifiable insurance coverage or both.Since April, La Plante said they have found five TNC drivers that had committed battery with other charges like DUIs and breaking-and-entering. Five sex offenders were also found in Madison.Everything you need to know about SnapRyde: The social networking, car-sharing app coming to UW campus

SnapRyde, the social car-sharing app where “rides happen at a lower Read…La Plante said uninsured vehicles were also very common in the TNC industry and that companies, such as Uber, stipulate this in their terms and agreements.Under Section 6 of Uber’s U.S. terms of use under limitation of liability, Uber is not responsible for any of their driver’s damages including lost profits, lost data, personal injury or property damage resulting from the use of the services, regardless of the negligence of Uber.“This has lead to numerous incidents of uninsured rideshare and TNC wrecks in the state and accident incidentals being forced on the general tax-paying public of Wisconsin,” La Plante said.Mike Hartmann, president of Wisconsin Limo Association, stressed TNCs created a large disadvantage to their company and others like it as they are not taxed and do not require full-time insurance, which is expensive, he said.Public transportation companies, such as taxis, cost more, but it is because they are paying massive amounts of money to insurance companies to cover all possible scenarios, La Plante said.“Another point that we try to make is that we are not in the business of destroying the idea of rideshares like Uber or Lyft,” La Plante said. “In reality, we also ask for looser regulations on taxis while getting common sense legislation for rideshares.”",Madison-based website makes Uber safer,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2008/04/17/behind-closed-doors/,"Apr 17, 2008","Casey stopped working the streets four days shy of her 18th birthday.The Madison native, now 25, had originally been laid over in Chicago on her way to a modeling gig when an older man enticed her out of the bus station. In search of money, drugs and attention, the 17-year-old agreed to turn a trick for him, as she had seen friends do in the past. She wasn’t even the youngest girl the pimp picked up at the bus station that night.One trick turned into another, and more after that, as the days blended together. The exact details of the ensuing months are hazy for Casey, who preferred not to use her full name. She was using heroin, she said.But she remembers vividly the day she stopped working the streets and returned to Madison after a john sexually assaulted her at knifepoint. The incident was a precursor to the larger emotional toll prostitution continues to take on her.“It goes a lot deeper than … you originally anticipate,” she said, her voice growing soft at the memory.Once she turned 18, Casey began exchanging sex for money again, this time as a call girl for escort services and through her own advertisements. She quit the lifestyle for good after she started working with a Madison program to help women with histories of prostitution.Last summer, Madison police began noticing a higher number of prostitutes in the West Badger Road area, a South Side neighborhood near the Beltline between South Park Street and Fish Hatchery Road. In a March 29 sting operation (“enforcement action” in police jargon), undercover police dressed as prostitutes netted 10 men there for trying to solicit sex. Prostitution-related arrests in Madison are on the rise.But Casey, who has been involved in prostitution through print advertisements, online communities and a massage parlor job, said these types of prostitution are more prevalent than the street-level crime Madison police target. They can occur anywhere, including the University of Wisconsin campus and residence halls, where Casey has made service calls.Prostitutes are increasingly practicing their trade behind closed doors, agreed Jan Miyasaki, director of Project Respect, the Madison nonprofit where Casey receives counseling. Crack houses, escort services and hook-ups made over the Internet have all opened additional avenues for prostitution, she said.“To the extent that this sex industry is growing everywhere, Madison’s keeping up with it,” Miyasaki said. “You don’t have to walk on the street to get a date anymore.”Running a stingThe recent sting was part of a larger effort to combat street-level prostitution in Madison following higher numbers of prostitutes working the West Badger Road neighborhood, police said.According to department records, total arrests on prostitution-related charges, which can be issued under state law (criminal charges) or city ordinances (civil charges), increased from 65 in 2006 to 73 in 2007. City citations grew from 14 to 48 in the same period. Police have attributed the rise to both increased activity and enforcement.The March enforcement effort yielded similar numbers of arrests as the last sting on West Badger Road in Nov. 2007, which resulted in the arrest of 12 johns, one of whom was a UW student.The enforcement tactics are designed to keep johns away — city ordinance citations carry a fine of $676 for first-time offenders — and indirectly address the drug trafficking that often comes with prostitution, according to police. Prostitutes themselves are usually taken into custody and fingerprinted before being released (the South District has a file of around 50 who typically work the area).“We’re focusing on where we can get the most bang for our buck and address the drug problem,” said Lt. Stephanie Bradley Wilson, the South District officer who organized the March sting.The pimps who are behind most of the street prostitution galvanize violence and drug use in neighborhoods, according to police and local officials.Sting methods are simple: When a john approaches one of the undercover officers walking the area and offers to pay for sex with money or other valuables — common incentives include cigarettes or crack — uniformed officers stationed nearby make the arrest. No tawdry dresses or high heels are involved.“You know, it’s funny. People watch too much TV and get this picture of a woman in fishnet stockings,” said former South District officer Susan Krause, who organized the November sting. “Prostitutes wear jeans and a sweatshirt and carry a backpack. There’s nothing glamorous about it.”In the North District, police have also worked with a neighborhood watch group to curb activity in the area around North Street and East Washington Avenue, once a hotbed for prostitution. South District officers are starting a similar program.“Is it dying down? It’s hard to say, but as long as people in the neighborhood report it, it’s hard for a prostitute to work at the street level,” said Sgt. Charles Weiss, who was part of a November sting on North Street that produced no arrests.Krause said that since November, six women formerly known as West Badger Road regulars have either been reunited with their families or have returned to school or the job market.A misplaced focus?But while the recent enforcement may have improved quality of life in two neighborhoods where residents have complained of finding used condoms on their driveways or even in their basements, Casey and Miyasaki said it misses the sordid underworld where the majority of prostitution in Madison occurs.It’s a problem of perception, Miyasaki explained, since street-level prostitution is in the public eye.“Poor neighborhoods and poor tricks get the most publicity,” she said.Ald. Tim Bruer, District 14, whose district includes West Badger Road, disagreed, saying, “In terms of sheer numbers … where the problem is epidemic is on the streets and tied to drug dealers and certain areas.”But Casey said more prostitution takes place — and more money changes hands — through Internet and print advertisements for call girls.“A lot of times the police turn a blind eye to that,” she said.“[The police] are really not pushing it the way that they could,” she added. “Nobody’s attacking the ones that are making the real money,” such as call girls advertised in the phonebook, who can make $300 an hour, she said.According to Casey, other types of prostitution occur through loose networks maintained in print and phonebook advertising, Internet communities, bathhouses and massage parlors. She herself has offered various services through print and online advertisements and at a massage parlor in Belvedere, Ill.In all of these ventures, actual prostitution isn’t explicitly mentioned, but almost always implied, Casey said.“The service won’t tell you straight out (to offer sex), but they know that you’ll figure it out,” she said. “You won’t get work if you don’t put out.”On a recent phone call to a newspaper advertisement for a “Blonde bombshell, sexy, clean & waiting for you!” in the “Miscellaneous Services,” “Sarah” hinted at further bargaining, although she refused to go into details over the phone. She declined to elaborate both before and after the reporter revealed his identity.“As long as you behave right and everything goes right, full service is included,” she said.‘It’s not our role’According to downtown alder and Dane County Assistant District Attorney Mike Verveer, the Geisha Bath House on East Washington Avenue and the Rising Sun massage parlor on West Main Street have longstanding reputations for practices that may verge on prostitution.“I think everybody realizes they’re kind of brothels in a way,” Verveer said, although he said he hasn’t received any specific complaints. “It doesn’t seem to have any impact on the quality of life of my constituents.”In 2007, police responded to one call about an unattended child in front of the Geisha Bath House, but found nothing, according to department records. Since the beginning of 2007, officers have responded to 56 calls at the Rising Sun’s address, which is located near several bars. Only one was listed as prostitution-related, in which a man’s wife tracked his vehicle’s global-positioning device to the establishment, and no charges were filed.Employees of the Rising Sun and the Geisha Bath House declined to comment.“With the call girls, dating services … these girls are prepared to go further, but none of that is prosecuted in our community,” Verveer said.“Frankly, I agree it should not be a priority for any of us involved in law enforcement,” he added. “Open-air prostitution is what impacts the quality of life.”Krause and Weiss noted that local police don’t have the resources to investigate prostitution behind closed doors, and Krause said such enforcement doesn’t fall under their jurisdiction.“Whether or not we deal with street prostitution, it doesn’t draw us away from the other types,” Krause said. “As beat cops, it’s not our role to deal with that.”The Milwaukee Police Department, on the other hand, has investigated escort services, Internet sites and phonebook advertisements in addition to street-level prostitution, according to Vice Control Division officer Lt. Joseph Erwin.“It’s a different way of doing business,” Erwin said. “We look at it all the same, as a violation of the law.”“We’re aware of what’s occurring there,” Weiss said of Internet venues like Craigslist, where prostitution is advertised in euphemistic terms. “There are things [the police] can do, but I can’t go into specifics.”Prostitution on campusCasey and Miyasaki also noted that prostitution can penetrate the college bubble, including at UW-Madison and other system schools.“Campus isn’t immune, even if people think it is,” Miyasaki said.The UW Police Department has only made prostitution arrests in the UW-Madison Arboretum, where johns have occasionally brought girls in their cars after the park is closed, according to Lt. Eric Holen.But Casey said she has turned tricks in dormitories and at fraternities at UW-Madison, although she admitted the college scene is a less lucrative market and, therefore, not as active.“A lot of girls don’t want to see college guys,” she said. “They don’t pay much and they try to get the most out of you.”One college student adjusted his clock to swindle her out of extra time, Casey said.For some female college students, prostitution is a means of quick income, Casey and Miyasaki added. Casey had a friend at UW-Whitewater who worked some of her way through school by exchanging money for sex, she said.“It’s a simpler decision,” she explained. “A couple of calls a week, you get your rent paid.”But Miyasaki cautioned that even prostitution on campus is no less of a “women’s issue.”Police encourage women they arrest and those that come to the weekly drop-in meals to begin counseling through Project Respect. Counseling focuses on how to get out of prostitution, rather than dwelling on the woman’s past, Miyasaki said.“It’s like talking to war veterans,” she explained. “Sometimes they want to talk about it. Sometimes they’re just trying to get on with their lives.”After six months of counseling, many women fall back into their old lifestyle, but Miyasaki estimated 60 percent don’t return to prostitution.“I had a survivor of juvenile and adult prostitution tell me that she would rather scrub a toilet with a toothbrush than ever go back to the lifestyle she had been living,” Jan said, describing a Project Respect participant who has since found a job as a janitor. “Only she could know what that was like.”Although Madison does more prostitution outreach and prevention efforts than most cities, the community also needs to address the root causes of the problem, Miyasaki said.“It’s just responding to poverty, homelessness, health insurance — all those things that contribute to a woman being desperate and having no options,” she said.Casey’s storyCasey’s first foray into prostitution started with the promise of a modeling gig and ended in a stranger’s garage.The twisted odyssey on the rough streets of Chicago doesn’t seem to fit the unobtrusive young woman. Casey appears to be a worldly cynic and naive youth at the same time, the tough wisdom of experience tempered by her mere 25 years, much of them spent outside of school and the workplace.Reserved and soft-spoken, eyes darting nervously before making contact, she’s not the archetypal “woman of the night.”In fact, she said she never referred to herself as a “prostitute” and the word has an archaic ring. The process of exchanging sex for money was never presented in such black-and-white terms by the Chicago pimp or anyone else.“He fed me a line,” Casey recalled. “He said, ‘You go to the bar and have sex with someone anyway; you might as well get paid for it.'”“The other part of it was probably I always wanted attention,” she added. Casey had answered an advertisement for a modeling gig and was on her way to Detroit before she was waylaid by the pimp in Chicago.“I wanted people to tell me I was pretty and stuff like that,” she explained. With prostitution, “there was money and people would tell me anything they thought would make me happy,” she said.But her time working the streets, where each trick was a trial for the shy teenager, ended after a seemingly normal john put a knife to her throat, covered her head with a pillowcase, bound her with zip ties and then sexually assaulted her.Casey returned to Madison, where she soon began working for an escort service. She also worked for men she was dating, as well as through phonebook advertisements.She quit when she had her first son at age 20, a child who was likely fathered by a man who paid her for sex, Casey said.Casey had always insisted on using condoms, but that was never any guarantee, she said.“Tricks are devious,” she explained. “They’ll turn you around and try to take [the condom] off while you’re turned around.”But the allure of fast money, which had always gone mostly to her heroin addiction, tempted her to return to the sordid life of a call girl after her son’s birth.“The money was good, but it was starting to take an emotional toll on me and my relationships,” she said.A former client had begun stalking her, and the work began to make her so sick to her stomach she wouldn’t answer calls to the phone number she advertised.With no addiction to finance, Casey quit for good and started counseling with Respect. She now works in a retail store to support her 4- and 2-year-old sons.She originally began down the path toward prostitution because of insecurities based in her own childhood, which was marred by physical and sexual abuse, Casey said. According to police and community outreach specialists who deal with prostitution, most women they see have a history of sexual abuse.Growing up, Casey was sexually abused for years by her neighbor, an older man who was friends with her father. She finally tried exposing him, but to no avail, she said.“Nobody gets their period at 7 years old, but they assumed I got my period,” Casey said. “When I told my dad, he didn’t believe me, and they made me go over there and apologize.”Men she’s been romantically involved with, many of whom also were her pimps, also menaced Casey physically.“I ended up one time trying to turn a trick to make money on my own, because he was giving me, like, five dollars a day to pick between cigarettes and food,” she said of a former boyfriend. “I got myself beat up that time, and he took the money.”Ultimately, Casey had to overcome her need for attention and acceptance to break out of the cycle of prostitution.“The biggest thing for me was I didn’t feel good about myself,” Casey said. “It makes you feel better for a minute, but it makes you feel worse later. … A lot of the guys are old enough to be your dad.”Madison’s sex ring: An exclusive clubBeneath the fa?ade of a growing Midwestern city lies a dense hierarchy of prostitution, according to Casey, who has exchanged sex for money by several different means.A step above street-level prostitution Madison police have focused on is the kind of escort services, masseuse work and exotic dancing advertised in local newspapers, she said. Many are small operations run by one of the prostitutes.Escort services generally charge a base fee for a girl to give a back massage and strip, with unspoken additional charges for her to do more.“If a guy touches you first without saying anything, you assume he’s not a cop and go on to offer other services,” Casey explained.In addition, newspaper classifieds sections serve as a recruiting center for prostitutes with ads supposedly for modeling and other jobs, Casey said.“Mostly when they’re looking for adult models, they’re just looking to pay you to screw,” she said. “A couple of guys on there have been doing it since the dawn of time,” including a current advertiser whom she has responded to in the past, she said.Phonebook ads take a similar tack, but attract a wealthier clientele who often pay call girls $160 for an appointment, plus $300 an hour.“A lot of girls … start off there,” Casey said. “They’re not old and used up.”Since call girl advertisements typically include the age and a brief description of the girl at most, referrals are needed to break into the business, especially in online advertisements on Craigslist and elsewhere. The group of men in Madison who frequent call girl prostitutes is a tight-knit group, according to Casey.“Most guys won’t see you unless guys fill out a reference, like whether you use a condom and what you do,” she said.Bathhouses and massage parlors, which often serve as de facto brothels, are also exclusive, Casey said. She worked briefly in a massage parlor in Belvedere, Ill.“[Business managers] keep cue cards of all the clientele,” she said. “If you haven’t been seen, you probably won’t get seen.”See also: Portrait of a prostitute in The City Within",Behind closed doors,UWM

Not another article by one of those annoying, radical, men-hating, blood-thirsty, flesh-eating, evil feminists!” Well, I’m not exactly sure what dictionary some young people have been reading lately, but feminists are not to be feared.According to the Oxford English Dictionary, feminism is “the advocacy of the equality of the sexes.” In my own words, I would define a feminist as a person who believes women deserve fair treatment and respect.No, I do not have “Flower Power” buttons on my backpack, I’m not a die-hard Hillary Clinton groupie, nor do I believe in the whole “Free The Nipple” movement (I go to school in Wisconsin. It’s cold here. I prefer to keep my clothes on).But I do not have to do all of those things to be a feminist. Feminism is about classic principles of human morality. Everyone should believe women are equally deserving as men of a life of opportunities and happiness. This idea is not a controversial political statement.White feminism is an assault on brown and black bodies

Do you respect your mother? Do you respect your sister? Do you care about any female in your life? If so, you should most certainly be a feminist. Feminism is not about women refusing to shave their underarm hair, hating men or believing women are superior. It is about gaining respect and rights that will assist women towards achieving a more equal chance to live a satisfied life.You might fear the word “feminism,” but you should be aware it’s based off the simple notion that you should treat all other people, even women, with integrity if you wish to be a decent human being.In the inspiring words of my favorite R&B artist, Kehlani,“every man has a fear of a strong minded woman.” Sadly, I have found this quote to be true in my own experience. Some men are afraid of seeing women succeed, because it is a threat to their own masculinity. Thus, they refute feminism as a defense mechanism.Women who bash the Women’s March need to take a step back

It was easier to establish male dominance if women were subjected to a lack of authority on a social, economic and political level. Yet, the most crucial level of degradation is that of the psychological level.Women have created damaging views of themselves because of factors that reinforce the negative, inferior image of women in society. These factors include magazine covers, advertisements, movies, school curriculums and more.I’ve seen it happen with my own eyes — young girls torturing themselves to look a certain way or act a certain way to try to gain boys’ approval. Without self confidence, young girls can’t simply feel worthy on their own. This lack of self esteem starting in women at a young age is imperative for the male-dominated culture to remain intact.We need feminism because we cannot allow one young person to believe someone else should determine their self worth or that one person is inferior to another simply because of their sex. In an ideal world, equality would be a reasonable goal, but, unfortunately, equality in all aspects is a lot to ask for right now.Why being a male feminist works for me
One thing that’s a little weird about being a male feminist is that people always seem to congratulate or compliment Read…For now, I simply ask for equal consideration. When I apply for the same job as a young man, I pray they consider me for my qualifications to the same degree as they would his. When a young woman has a dream, no one else should squash her enthusiasm so much so that it discourages her from pursuing it. I ask for men to speak to me, a female, the same way they would want to be spoken to. No more objectification. No more condescending remarks. No more telling women they should “know their place.”I want to live in a world where I will be able to speak my mind without someone simply dismissing me as a “bitch” before they even hear out my side of the argument. So, if you got through this entire column without sending me a hate email or mean comment, then I encourage you to help create a happier and safer environment for women. It’s really not that daunting of a task.

Women are taught to not only to avoid the dark alleyways but also the populated public streets. And there is good reason for this. I have been catcalled by two middle aged men on State Street at 11:00 a.m. My best friend has been approached late at night by men in a car offering her a ride home because they could see her “nice legs” from under her parka.There is no doubt women have people and things to fear. We are treated like objects, not people. In our society, a woman’s sexuality is not for herself but for the pleasure of any man who feels he deserves it. This concept manifests itself in catcalling.University of Wisconsin and its beautiful campus full of friendly people is not exempt from this pervasive issue. It is rare to walk around on a busy street during a weekend night and not be catcalled. Catcalling is how men display their perceived ownership of a woman’s sexuality, of my sexuality.In that moment, I am not a female majoring in psychology who works in a preschool and has career aspirations and friends.

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2006/01/20/moonlight-bunny-ranc/,"Jan 20, 2006","When asked what he does for a living, Dennis Hof is quick to reply, ""I'm a businessman, first and foremost."" And wording is important to Hof, who owns one of America's most famed brothels, Nevada's Moonlight Bunny Ranch, as he adds, ""I don't like the terminology 'pimp,' just for what it stands for.""In fact, Hof really doesn't like that word, later asserting, ""Pimps are the most worthless creatures on the planet,"" as he refers to those in control of America's countless illegal, undocumented prostitutes. ""They exploit these women … they control them with heroin. That's what pimps do,"" Hof comments, with a certain fiery passion in his voice.Anne Bissell, a former prostitute, isn't so quick to subscribe to the difference between people like Hof and illegal pimps. ""I think that the Bunny Ranches [are] almost worse [than street prostitution] because it almost becomes like a prison. And I don't understand why we still have that. We're not the old West.""The vast dichotomy between Hof and Bissell's views is hardly unique. While the United States has no federal law on prostitution, all but one state in the union consider it to be illegal. And Nevada, the sole locale of tax-paying brothels, only permits the activity in counties with a population of less than 250,000 — meaning that the women working the Las Vegas strip are still considered outlaws.Prostitution — both the legal and illegal variety — are hardly new to Western society. The Bible contains numerous references to the profession, with Hosea even being instructed to wed one such ""harlot."" But in a society where street work has become largely synonymous with physical abuse, drug addiction and disease proliferation, the divide between those who believe in legalization and absolution seems to only grow.Hof and Bissell came to their estranged viewpoints through differing paths.The Nevada businessman grew up the son of a postal employee, with relatively modest means. But before long, he had worked his way into the business world and come to enjoy some level of success. Then, as he explains, a woman entered the picture.""I slept with the right girl. Everything happens around sex,"" Hof insists. ""I moved to Reno, a working girl picked me up and I started dating her. … I didn't know she was a working girl. Finally she told me."" Before long, through a seemingly bizarre course of events, Hof found himself with a unique proposition: ""[T]his tough old guy, 74 years old, says, 'You ever thought about owning a cathouse?' And everybody does … [so I] bought it and went to work.""Today Hof's Moonlight Bunny Ranch is renowned as one of the world's preeminent brothels. Its website, www.bunnyranch.com, is a veritable adult playground, glamorizing the northern Nevada establishment to the max. Hof's employees include former Playboy Playmates, stars of the pornography world and, yes, otherwise ordinary women. He has dated Sunset Thomas, is rumored to be seeing Heidi Fleiss and even has his own show on HBO these days.Bissell tells a different personal story. ""I was sexually abused, I was desperate … the peer group around me made it sound like a great thing to do,"" so, as a teenager, she turned to prostitution.""I turned my first trick when I was 17,"" she writes in her new book, ""Memoirs of a Sex Industry Survivor."" ""I got out of the sex industry … when I was 21. I carried my secret for over a decade. Then, in 1991, I met a woman who admitted to being a prostitute,"" she writes. ""Since then, I have been sharing my story with other sex-industry survivors. Since then, I have been trying to understand the interrelationship between sexual abuse, incest and prostitution.""Today, Bissell runs Sex Industry Survivors Anonymous and is an outspoken opponent of the sex industry — including legalized prostitution.""The pro-prostitution people, they are the ones that want to call it a job. They want to call it 'sex work,'"" she argues. ""They think it should be legalized. And any job that you have to disassociate from to survive is not a healthy thing. Any job that leaves you with severe post-traumatic stress disorder is not something that we should be calling 'work.'""Yet Hof is quick to note that if the trade has been with us for millennia, the solution may lie more in regulation than attempts to curb society's oldest job.""The answer is, take the criminals out of it. License these guys,"" he insists. ""Make sure you have a safe environment for the girls to work in. … These girls are terribly exploited. It's a terrible business outside of legalization. They force these girls to be exploited by keeping it illegal.""Bissell, however, contends that exploitation isn't limited to the illegal side of prostitution. ""A lot of the women are pretty much trapped out there,"" she says of legal brothels before criticizing Hof personally: ""He extorts sex from these women. He extorts pornographic movies.""The Nevada businessman, of course, disagrees. In fact, he takes great pride in being a relatively new-thinking brothel owner when it comes to the question of imprisonment.""I took more of a human approach to it and a business approach and generally accepted business and accounting practices,"" Hof says. ""The first thing I disliked about these houses is that they're locked down. They're basically booty prisons. … I don't want to be involved in a business that is booty prison. … So I said, 'Let's not punish the masses for what a few idiots do wrong.' So we give everybody the benefit of the doubt. You're honest, you're OK … and that was tremendously successful because a tremendous number of the girls don't need that institutionalized environment.""Hof has even taken steps to reform some of the traditionally shady business practices of brothels — both legal and illegal.""A girl should have a choice. … The old school is if you don't want to party with [a customer], then you give us the money,"" he notes — adding that ""party"" is industry lingo for sex. ""My process is if a girl doesn't want to party with a guy, just be nice to him … that's all we ask. And it works very well. In the car business, they would say there is an ass for every seat. It's the same way in my business.""Hof also is quick to point out that he allows his employees to negotiate their own rates, with the house collecting 50 percent. This process was well recorded in the documentary ""Cathouse,"" HBO's first venture into Hof's business, where negotiations between working women and clients were secretly recorded.Still, whether or not brothels are ""booty prisons,"" countless questions remain about their social effects. The Bunny Ranch owner proudly notes that since the profession adopted mandatory STD testing in Nevada more than 20 years ago, not a single HIV or AIDS test has come back positive. STDs, statistically, are exceptionally rare in Nevada brothels, according to Hof, and those on the anti-legalization side of the argument don't argue the point.Rather, those opposed to regulated brothels point to a general expansion of promiscuity's acceptance, asserting that with legality comes heightened illegality.""Legalization/decriminalization of prostitution is a gift to pimps, traffickers and the sex industry. It promotes sex trafficking. It doesn't control the sex industry; it expands it. It increases child prostitution. It does not protect the women in prostitution,"" Bissell argues. ""It also increases the demand because it seems more acceptable, it's legal.""Unfortunately, statistics are difficult to come across. Given the illegal nature of prostitution in the vast majority of the United States, records kept are confined to data collected from those who are arrested or otherwise ""caught."" And while there can be no question that the shady dealings of hookers and johns are alive and well on street corners throughout the country, it is unclear whether or not Nevada's unique policy has had a direct effect on proliferation.What is known is that illegal prostitution sees thousands of violent acts committed every year, with at least several hundred grizzly fatalities carried out in its name. The spread of STDs appears to be prominent by all accounts, as both the oftentimes-unprotected nature of the sexual acts themselves and the frequent use of intravenous drugs lead to sickness and early death.Neither Hof nor Bissell downplay this oftentimes-tragic prominence of prostitution, with the former noting, ""It's in every city in the world. It's either done legally, or illegally, or it's tolerated. Everywhere in the U.S. — except for Nevada — makes it illegal, but they do tolerate it.""And that suggestion of wink-and-nod toleration seems to be relatively accurate. Through websites like Craig's List, which allow consumers to post advertisements for any number of services — including those of the erotic variety — prostitutes and johns have never had such an easy time finding each other for illegal rendezvous.One such ad, left by ""Jenna"" on an Omaha-area website, offers, ""I am a teacher by day, and a professional 'fetish artist' by night. I am a voluptuous African-American girl with soft curves, large hips, and a large, round & firm ass. … I love meeting older gentlemen who know how to treat a pretty young girl, and enjoy receiving pleasure in return!""Shortly after ""Jenna's"" rates are listed ($300 an hour), a disclaimer can be found at the foot of her post — a standard line of caution found all over such Internet ads: ""This is not an offer of prostitution. Money exchanged is for time and companionship only. Anything else that may occur is a matter of personal choice between two or more consenting adults of legal age, and is not contracted for, nor is it requested to be contracted for, or compensated for in any manner.""Whether it be through ""escort"" ads like this, street-corner transactions, illegal brothels, Nevada's cathouses or any other medium, it is clear that the business of prostitution is alive and well in America today. What remains unclear, though, is how the government and society should treat the trade. On one hand are persuasive arguments of sterilization, empowerment and taxation, while on the other side are claims of heightened promiscuity, murderous disease and a deadly culture.One thing, though, is clear: the world's oldest profession won't be going away anytime soon. As Hof puts it, ""We all learn to read with one hand in the bathroom.""",Moonlight Bunny Ranch boss reveals tricks of trade,UWM

B-Side will celebrate this Saturday with goodies and a sale.[/media-credit]As many gear up for Dane County’s first outdoor farmers’ market of the year this Saturday, Madison music lovers will be abuzz for more than farm-fresh cheese bread: The fifth annual Record Store Day celebrates a different brand of local goodness. Since the all-day, international event kicked off in 2008, it has taken place the third Saturday in April. This year, many stores are trying to one-up the festivities of Record Store Days past.Record Store Day connects artists with their fans via limited edition albums and live music events. Discounts and giveaways also provide added incentive to opt for a local record store, with more than 700 independent record stores in the U.S. participating each year. The day’s official site recommends “being BFFs with your neighborhood record store.” Conveniently, Madison has at least five of them.“[Record Store Day] is a great antidote for all the negative press record stores get for being a ‘dying breed,'” said Dave Zero, owner of MadCity Music Exchange. “We’ve been able to change with the times and give people what they want.”Zero’s store has been involved with the event since its inception, and he reported that the customer reception has consistently been positive.“It’s huge. It’s turned into our biggest day of the year,” he said. “We try to make sure the customers we see all the time are taken care of because they celebrate Record Store Day every day and every week. We’re also really excited about getting new people in here for the first time to see what we’re all about. New faces and regular faces; there’s something for everyone.”He added that the number of special activities and general “party” aspects of the day have snowballed since the first year. The store will open at 8:30 a.m. with a variety of prizes and sales, most notably collectible vinyl. Zero said the store will take advantage of its Williamson Street location next to restaurant and bar Bandung, which will have live music, food and drinks throughout the day. MadCity is also planning to have “buskers,” or street musicians, stationed outside the record store to add to the musical experience.“We’ll bring out all of our big eBay-worthy type records that we don’t like to give to eBay; we like to give our customers first dibs on everything,” Zero said, pausing to emphasize that Record Store Day is incomparable to sale events like Black Friday. “We always have a busy day, but we’re not trying to promote quick, cheap stuff. We’re trying to remember music is something special and shouldn’t be so quickly dismissed and gobbled up.”The more centrally-located Exclusive Co. has a similar ethic when it comes to observing Record Store Day. Its lineup for the day is perhaps the most star-studded in the city, anticipating a free performance from Sarah Watkins, formerly of Nickel Creek, on Saturday evening, as well as having singer/songwriter Sara Bareilles in-store during the day for autographs.There will be extended hours, giveaways, a used item sale and DJs spinning in the store as well. Assistant Manager Aaron Miller has worked at this Exclusive Co. location for 10 years and said Record Store Day is meant to generate excitement about traditional music recordings. He feels this goal has been achieved among the store’s customers each year.“Record Store Day is to remind people how cool it is to have physical copies of music: things that are unique that you can’t download. You can’t download the tie-dyed Flaming Lips vinyl,” Miller said, in reference to a limited edition album that co-worker Caitlin Salach is eyeing.“One of the coolest things they’re releasing for Record Store Day is the Flaming Lips’ huge collab album; Bon Iver is on it, Ke$ha, Nick Cave, like a million artists. Each individual vinyl they’re releasing is 100 percent unique, hand-mixed tie dye,” Salach said.“There’s almost like an art to owning a record. I think it gives people a reason to go out and appreciate music beyond going to see a live show,” she continued. “It just puts a lot of integrity into collecting music.”Both Salach and Miller agreed that vinyl is increasing in popularity among casual as well as more avid collectors. Record Store Day is just one way to embrace such a trend among music enthusiasts.“For me personally, I think purchasing vinyl is an up-and-coming thing, and I like all the attention that’s being brought to it. It’s actually the first time in years that the sale of vinyl hasn’t gone done per year and is starting to go up,” Salach said. “Digital is going down; even CDs are going down. So, I just think it’s really fascinating how since the ’50s it’s gotten smaller and smaller and smaller, and now it’s almost like a collector thing or a hobby.”Some stores get involved in Record Store Day more subtly. Ear Wax is a unique landmark in the city for its punk and metal focus, but these tastes do not stop it from taking part in the event. Owner Rob Cleveland said he tries each year to “latch on” to Record Store Day’s limited edition releases that might appeal to his consumers.“There are a few titles, but there’s not a lot of punk and heavy metal coming out. We try to make up for it with good sales,” he said.Ear Wax will be offering 25 percent off all used vinyl, and he said the event is a helpful way to remind people that the medium is still out there; after all, “They never stopped making vinyl.”Across the globe, special-edition 7″ records will be released Saturday from artists like Artic Monkeys, Beach House, David Bowie, Ray Charles and more. ArtsEtc.’s top album to watch for this Record Store Day is the Carolina Chocolate Drops’ cover of Run DMC’s “You Be Illin,'” especially since this vinyl comes with the rap group’s original recording on its B side.Speaking of B-side, the so-named record store that’s sandwiched between Ear Wax and Exclusive Co. on State Street will also be a good stop on Saturday. B-side owner Steve Manley is an old hand at the Record Store Day rigmarole, and his store will offer refreshments, goodie bags and giveaways, in addition to a storewide sale.“We will have DJs from WORT most of the day Saturday [and] will be bringing in a lot of limited edition vinyl,” Manley said.“Also, the Literacy Network will have professional musicians, mostly local, planted everywhere to raise money for literacy. On State Street, there will be music all over the place. It’s coincidental but it’s kind of nice that it just happens to be the same day,” he said, highlighting that Literacy Network’s fundraising event will provide an added presence of music that is a critical part of Record Store Day.Catering to not State Street but Monroe Street, Strictly Discs targets solely CD and vinyl consumers. The store endorses itself as the host of “Madison’s heaviest Record Store Day event” and is certainly highly publicizing it, sending email announcements to customers more than a month in advance. The store’s cornucopia of Record Store Day offerings include grab bags, discount vinyl accessories like cleaning fluid and 15 percent off all in-stock Pro-Ject Turntables.Friday’s agenda at Strictly Discs boasts a WSUM live broadcast, and Saturday will see local artists and DJs spinning records in the store. The store’s website claims there is a “unique culture surrounding independent record stores” and that “part of keeping the culture of music alive is keeping record stores healthy and vital parts of our communities.”With the participation of every major independent record store in Madison, Saturday seems destined for success in the music department.“It always surprises me when I hear of a record store that doesn’t want to participate,” Zero said. “There’s so much promotion, and it’s really a fun time. It’s not like it’s Go Buy a Sweater Day.”The fifth annual Record Store Day, the celebration of “real live record stores,” is all day Saturday, with some Madison stores opening at midnight.

Ragsdale, who is originally from Ann Arbor, Mich., was a junior at UW when the threats were made.With 80 million registered users, ask.fm is one of the most popular social question and answer sites. Despite its popularity, the Latvia-based company came under fire for cyber-bullying that occurred on the site. A report from Buzzfeed linked ask.fm to at least nine suicides.The message, which threatened sexual violence and severe bodily harm, was signed “Ok I’m almost done. I just want you to know that I’ve been saving a bucket of my cum for you. It’s almost half way full now” and was posted anonymously to the girl’s ask.fm account in response to her own question, “Do you go to Skyline?”Skyline, according to the affidavit, is a local public high school in Ann Arbor, Mich. When contacted, Skyline High School refused to comment on whether or not Ragsdale had been enrolled as a student there. However, based on online search results, it appears he did attend the school prior to his enrollment at UW.Ragsdale allegedly posted the threats around 10:30 p.m. on Oct. 13, 2013.The victim and her family contacted Ann Arbor law enforcement the following day, and the FBI was contacted shortly after.Approximately two weeks later, FBI Special Agent Sean Nicol requested the assistance of the FBI Legal Attache, the bureau’s overseas office, in Riga, Latvia, according to the affidavit.

https://badgerherald.com/news/2021/09/23/wisconsin-abortion-laws-to-be-under-the-microscope-in-2022-gubernatorial-election/,"Sep 23, 2021","Following the Supreme Court’s decision that upheld the Texas Senate Bill 8 banning abortions after six weeks, Wisconsinites question the imminent effects of the precedent on the state’s abortion laws ahead of an election year.Current Wisconsin law permits abortions before the 21-week mark, provided the mother wait 24 hours to make a decision after a mandatory counseling session.In his first campaign, Gov. Tony Evers vowed he would not challenge reproductive healthcare rights. As long as Evers holds office, it seems unlikely Wisconsin’s abortion laws will change — but with the Wisconsin gubernatorial election coming up next November, the future of Wisconsin abortion law is less certain.Wisconsin legislature reintroduces ‘Born Alive’ abortion bill
Wisconsin’s Republican-controlled Legislature reintroduced its ‘Born Alive’ abortion bill last Tuesday. The bill would make it so health care providers Read…Wisconsin GOP legislators passed four bills in 2019 proposing more conservative abortion laws, but Evers vetoed them. If Wisconsin elects a Republican governor next November, potentially drastic changes could be in store for Wisconsin’s abortion laws.One of the 2019 bills,  Assembly Bill 179, would have allowed felony or homicide charges against healthcare professionals if they failed to care for babies who are born alive after an attempted abortion. A similar bill, referred to as the Born-Alive Bill, was reintroduced in Wisconsin this September but has not been voted on.Though critics of the bill say it does not add provisions beyond what is already covered in the ethical obligations of a doctor and the illegality of infanticide, pro-life advocates argue they continue to see born-alive cases where they believe the baby is inhumanely treated.The bill states in the case of a failed abortion, the medical staff present is obligated to provide life-saving procedures needed for babies who have survived late-term abortions.Grace Skogman, the legislative director Wisconsin Right to Life, said born-alive cases should be addressed by the legislature.“We do know children are born alive after abortion and are not provided care,” Skogman said. “We know this continues to be a real issue.”The 2019 Assembly Bill 180 would have required doctors to tell patients carrying out pregnancy is possible after taking Mifepristone — the first of two pills a patient takes to abort a pregnancy — given the patient seeks immediate medical intervention and does not take Misoprostol, the second pill.Female athletes, academics discuss Title IX near its 50th anniversary
Female athletes and scholars discussed the present and future of women in sports at an online session hosted by the Read…The bill would have also required the state to publicly identify every healthcare center that has provided an abortion. Evers, when he vetoed the bill, said the disclaimer was not necessarily true, as it is not scientifically proven and such comments interfere with the patient-physician relationship.The veoted 2019 Assembly Bill 182 would have prohibited an abortion to be sought as a result of the fetus’s race, sex or disability — with exceptions on the severity of the disability.Another veoted bill, 2019 Assembly Bill 183, would have barred the Department of Health Services from certifying a provider under the Medical Assistance program if they offered abortion services and similarly would have allowed the DHS to decertify a provider for conducting abortion services.In doing so, the provider would not be able to bill Medicare and consequently, all of the provider’s patients would have likely been forced to pay for the services out-of-pocket.While neither bill proposed completely banning abortion, pro-choice advocates have raised concerns that it would be more difficult to not only get an abortion but access things like women’s wellness exams, STD screening, pregnancy tests and other similar services offered at many clinics providing abortion services.“I am vetoing this bill in its entirety because I object to this restriction on women’s access to basic reproductive healthcare,” Evers said in his veto message of Bill 183.But in light of Texas’ legal success in upholding its abortion bill, TSB8, Skogman said many states may reintroduce similar bills. She hopes Wisconsin will follow suit, particularly with a “heartbeat” bill. The heartbeat bill proposes abortions be banned as soon as the fetal heartbeat can be heard in an ultrasound, which typically occurs around the six-week mark.Pro-choice protesters across the nation fear the implementation of Texas’ abortion law and others could undermine the Roe v. Wade decision, resulting in a cascade of legal effects. For example, an existing abortion ban from 1849 is on the books in Wisconsin, though it is unenforceable due to previous Supreme Court decisions. The law made it illegal to perform abortions and considers it a felony punishable by up to six years in prison and extended supervision, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.University of Wisconsin political expert Michael Wagner said these laws could be enacted if SCOTUS overturns Roe v. Wade. Wagner said it is less clear if the election of a Republican governor would turn the tide of abortion laws in the state.Wisconsin GOP fights back against new state COVID testing requirements
Governor Evers issued a new order effective Oct. 18 to mandate weekly testing for unvaccinated government workers and government workers Read…“It’s hard to tell because Republicans had eight years with Republican Gov. Scott Walker in office with a majority Republican legislature to pass a bunch of laws that enhanced abortion restrictions and didn’t,” Wagner said.Due to growing fears about the possibility of Roe v. Wade being overturned among pro-choice advocates, Sen. Kelda Roys and Rep. Lisa Subeck introduced a bill that would repeal the 1849 ban, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.Repealing the ban is a precautionary measure in case a Republican is elected in 2022 and the court overturns Roe, the sponsors argue.“The majority of justices on the Supreme Court right now are conservative — all appointed by Republican presidents. We would expect that a president who nominated conservatives would be looking to overturn Roe v. Wade,” Wagner said. “However, there is precedent and the court might not want to overturn it without a reason. Still, for pro-choice advocates, this is the most danger Roe has been in [in] 30 years.”",Wisconsin abortion laws to be under the microscope in 2022 gubernatorial election,UWM

Students said when they ignored the group on their way to class and refused to take their pamphlets, they were yelled at and called sinners or told they were going to hell.UW defines acceptable, unacceptable protest in recently updated guidelines
In response to the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents policy passed last year requiring protestors who disrupt speakers Read…UWSP sophomore Mariah Bethel said there were around 15-20 people holding signs, yelling at students and passing out pamphlets.“The fact that they abused their power of freedom of speech to use it as freedom to harass [and] assault students was disgusting,” Bethel said.UWSP junior Michael Treder was walking to class when he passed the group.As a man, he was not a target but his women friends were directly in the line of fire.“I know women with PTSD from rape who were called abominations, whores and so on,” Treder said. “They had panic attacks and feared for their safety.”Additionally, UWSP senior Summer Thompson said her friend was told she was “going to hell” because she was wearing leggings.But UWSP student Jacob Droves said in a Facebook comment on another student’s post that he witnessed pro-choice students harassing the pro-life protesters at another location on campus, separate from the location where the pro-life protesters were yelling at students.“Insults, vulgarities and violent comments were made toward the [pro-life protesters],” Draves said.ASM proposes taking action against gelatin in Babcock ice cream

Some unacceptable behavior included creating noise that interferes with the event or carrying signs when the event doesn’t permit them. The acceptable behavior included engaging in conversation with the speaker.Because the group isn’t affiliated with the UW System, these rules do not apply.Due to their First Amendment rights, UWSP administrators were unable to stop Missionaries to the Preborn. Though witnesses said campus police did have a presence during the protest to prevent any physical violence.Toward the end of the protest, however, students got together to make signs as means of counter-protest, Thompson said.“Because we know our campus couldn’t do anything, due to freedom of speech,” Bethel said. “We all felt harassed and powerless.”",‘Rape is a preference’: UW-Stevens Point students harassed by group touring around UW campuses,UWM

https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2011/03/21/rape-analogies-have/,"Mar 21, 2011","It’s no secret that political rhetoric on both sides of the ideological spectrum is getting pretty ridiculous.Whether it is conservatives trying to paint President Barack Obama as a Kenyan-born socialist or liberals likening Gov. Scott Walker to a violent dictator, such exaggerated insults have become far too common and hinder reasonable discussions by inflaming emotions.At least annoying digs like these are so over-the-top and ridiculous that most people can easily brush them off as untrue.But political debate using analogies to rape – specifically a certain victim of rape – are ridiculously inappropriate and really tick me off.Earlier this month, news broke in a small Texas community that an 11-year-old girl was allegedly the victim of a gang rape last fall, with upward of 18 males involved from age 14 to 26. In a town of about 9,000 people, these allegations obviously had quite an impact.And as it was reported by community members that this young girl would wear clothes that were inappropriate for her age, apparently a Florida state legislator decided to seize this tidbit of information for her own benefit.According to The St. Petersburg Times, Republican Rep. Kathleen Passidomo referenced the Texas rape while in a committee hearing for a school dress code bill last week.“There was an article about an 11-year-old girl who was gang raped in Texas by 18 young men because she was dressed like a 21-year-old prostitute,” Passidomo said. “And her parents let her attend school like that.”If it sounds like Passidomo is blaming the victim’s appearance as a direct cause for the rape, it’s because she is. The article even included a line saying that no one from either party addressed her comment at the meeting, likely because both her Republican colleagues and the Democrats knew that Passidomo was in dangerous territory.As if that girl has not been through enough trauma, she has people telling her that the rape was her own fault by wearing trashy clothes. Both the Florida legislator and members of her own community pointed their fingers at that young girl in an interview with The New York Times, saying she is ruining the alleged rapists’ lives with these charges.“It’s just destroyed our community,” community member Sheila Harrison said to The New York Times. “These boys have to live with this the rest of their lives.”Heaven forbid a bunch of rapists have to live with a stigma.It is important to remember that many of the celebrities that tweens worship nowadays are not known for their wholesome wardrobe choices. As a result, dressing sexy has become an unfortunate trend among younger girls. But it’s not as if these outfits have power over men like a Pavlov’s dog experiment wherein if you ring a bell they can’t help but rape someone.However, if they do, I’d say we have a much, much bigger problem on our hands involving the males of our species.I think it’s safe to say males give themselves more credit than that, so to say these outfits have a direct causation effect for rape is grossly inaccurate and unfair. All Passidomo did with her argument is heap more emotional trauma on an 11-year-old rape victim who is already pretty scarred for life.Nice work.But if you think I’m unfairly picking on Republicans with that reference, I’ll throw in a similar example involving a very well-known Democrat.According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, Vice President Joe Biden, while at a Philadelphia campaign fundraising event last Friday, compared the Republican’s view of the country’s economic woes as “blaming the rape victim.”“… It’s amazing how these Republicans, the right wing of this party- whose philosophy threw us into this God-awful hole we’re in, gave us the tremendous deficit we’ve inherited – that they’re now using … the very economic condition they have created to blame the victim,” Biden said at the fundraiser.He preambled this statement by saying “blame the victim” was in fact a long-time Republican mantra in actual rape cases.So, the impression I got from this is that Biden is basically saying the Republicans “raped” the U.S. economy and now they are blaming the “victims” – Democrats and their supporters – for the problem.How’s that for civility in discourse?I’m sure even the Democrats attending that fundraiser were wondering just what Biden was doing with such an awkward and inappropriate analogy between rape and the economy, and Obama was probably irritated that Biden had yet another face-palm moment.I think we can all agree that rape is a serious matter, too serious to be used in a quest for a political power play against opponents. Politicians of every ideological background would do well to limit their discussions of rape to an actual discussion of rape.Alicia Yager (ayager@badgerherald.com) is a senior majoring in journalism and French.",Rape analogies have no place in political discourse,UWM

Below is the transcript of the 44-minute interview.Portions have been edited for clarity, and other parts have been removed entirely to protect the victim’s identity. This text is being posted with permission of the victim.BH: The Badger HeraldV: VictimVF: Victim’s FriendBH: First of all, thank you again for coming in. If at any point you feel uncomfortable or anything like that just tell me.V: Yeah.BH (to VF): So, you had a part in this too it sounds like?VF: Well ours were at different times. Last spring I went to a party at [the Sigma Chi] house and I was talking to a member of their fraternity and while I glanced away for like a second he dropped a pill in my drink, and I looked back soon enough to see it dissolving in the drink. I was with a friend who didn’t notice it until I pointed out that it was dissolving, so we just walked away, poured out the cup.BH: OK, that’s good to hear.V: Basically I want her here for that, so people aren’t like “Oh, it only happened once,” and for support, too.BH: Sure, sure, understandable. OK, we’ll move on then. We’ll just dive in right away then, if you could just describe when the assault occurred in as much detail as you’re comfortable giving.V: Do you want the whole story? Like my whole day?BH: Sure, anything leading up to it.V: It was on Oct. 4. It was a night game. Sigma Chi was having a pregame, and there were tons of people there and then after the pregame I left and went to the Badger game. Afterwards, everyone was walking back, and I met up with two Sigma Chis and a pledge from my sorority, and we went to [State Street] Brats. And I got one drink there, and then one of the Sigma Chis bought me a shot. I was fine — I wasn’t blackout or anything. I was like drunk during the day, but then I stopped drinking from like 5. … I was drunk, I’m not going to lie, but I wasn’t like blehhh.So then we went to Johnny O’s, and it was really, really crowded — we were up top [on the rooftop deck]. I bought everybody pineapple vodkas and I handed them back to everybody and mine was the last one. The last thing I remember was saying to [my friend], “Wow, this pineapple vodka is really good.” I don’t remember one thing after that. I wake up, and this person comes into his room and says “What the fuck, why are you passed out in my room? Why are your pants off? This is not OK; you cannot pass out in someone’s room. What the fuck are you doing here?” And just yelling at me. And I said “Sorry, I don’t know why I’m here.”I texted somebody that I was so embarrassed. And that’s all. Then I woke up [in my bed] and I went to the bathroom, and I wiped and I was gushing blood. I was like “What the heck?” and I was really, really sore. I called my mom, bawling, and I told her I thought I got raped.Then I went to Meriter Hospital and my mom met me there; my roommate came too but left later. I was there from 11 to 5, because I collected evidence with what happened to me — they took pictures, grabbed DNA. She stuck a Q-tip in me and I just started bawling, and I have a really, really high pain tolerance.She said from how I was down there that more than one guy raped me, like they took turns with me. She said I was one of the worst cases she’s seen with how violent it was. The next day I had a fat lip, I couldn’t move my jaw, and I had a bruise on my face. I had bruises up and down my legs and by my vagina, so it wasn’t consensual or anything — it was really violent. I went to the doctor obviously and I had to get tested for STDs, AIDS and all that, I don’t have that, but they said from how my lip looked I either got punched in the face or I bit my lip so hard. The reason I had a bruise was because they think they moved my head to make me move.BH: So just to clarify, when you went to Meriter, was it 11 the next morning?V: Yeah. Oh, and I got tested to see if I had been given roofies, but [it came back negative]. But they also said you need to go within the hour or it’s not detectable. So they said it wasn’t that [I] didn’t get roofied, it just couldn’t be proven.BH: Are there any details that you can think of that need to be added?V: No, I think you’ve got it.BH: So, you have no idea who the assaulters were?V: No, if I did, they would be going to jail. I’d press charges, I have a police investigation going on. If I knew who they were, I would be putting those fuckers in jail. And also my therapist said that most girls who get raped don’t report stuff, they don’t do what I’m doing right now. They usually prey on weaker woman, so most people don’t come forward.BH: You went into this a bit earlier, but what happened in the days following the assault?V: I went home for the whole week. I didn’t go to school. I was really depressed and felt violated, and I couldn’t believe that something like this happened to me. And it was really frustrating because I felt like I deserved this or something, and I absolutely didn’t deserve it, but most rape victims feel like that. You feel worthless, is a better word for it. It steals so much of your life. My life is ruined because of what they did. And if I knew who these people were, I would want to ruin theirs.BH: Do you know the status currently of the investigation?V: No, she (the police detective) doesn’t tell me one thing because she thinks the investigation will be blown.BH: Does that make you feel more or less secure that you can’t know?V: No, absolutely awful, because I have no control over this, of getting raped, so I feel like I have no control over this investigation. And I had my therapist call to say this isn’t right that she doesn’t know one thing, and my detective basically told her nothing. The one thing I know is that DNA is being processed in the lab. So I guess that means I have DNA, which is good. [Chuckles].BH: Did you tell the university immediately afterwards?V: Well, actually, you go to Meriter and they contact the Rape Crisis Center, who then gets in touch with the university. The university actually contacted me about it, and was like “Hi, are you OK? Blah blah blah.” That was it. Honestly, from my experience with the university, I don’t think that they helped at all. And I feel like a lot of teachers here at UW-Madison [aren’t] empathetic to it. Within my major they’re very understanding. But I just felt that part of it was unfair because people don’t understand what I’m going through. So they’re just like, “OK, well you have a week to do your homework.” And it’s just like, “Yeah, I would love to have a week to do my homework, but right now I’m every emotionally affected, and I can’t study for my midterms unless you want me to get F’s.”And also, with the dean of students, my dean, wasn’t very helpful. I still have effects from my rape, with my situations where I can’t leave my house. When you get raped they say, “Oh, you’re a victim of a crime.” That’s all the university says. That’s not as big of a justification as, “This person was raped.” So I personally have to e-mail all my professors and tell them that I was raped. Which is awful — it’s like, I don’t want to talk to anyone about it, so why would I want to talk to some stranger I don’t know?My dean of students wasn’t very helpful with my situation. But this semester she called me and said, “[My professor] called and we need to know where you’re seeking therapy and if you’re still seeking therapy.” I say, “Well how is that relevant and how is that any of your business?” And she’s like, “Well I need to know.” She wasn’t very friendly. But she (VF) spoke to somebody who was so helpful, was totally on board, and she’s the reason [Sigma Chi is] on social probation.BH: Sigma Chi is on social probation?V: Yeah, they were just put on social probation because of Suzanne, with dean of students. They just were put on the day [VF] contacted Suzanne. [Editor’s Note: Sigma Chi voluntarily placed itself on social probation].VF: I sent an anonymous e-mail to the Pan-Hellenic Association, dean of students, Interfraternity Council basically saying how disappointed and disgusted I am by the lack of action that was taken after the incidents and that I had heard there was another person raped [at Sigma Chi], and as a woman and a friend of someone who was a victim that they hadn’t taken any action. I guess I sent that letter a little over a week ago to them, and since they received that, my dean of students, Suzanne, was really receptive. She contacted me immediately the next day and set up an appointment with me and moved forward with the actions, including contacting the national fraternity headquarters to notify them of the incident, who they said they had never been contacted about prior.BH: As far as social probation goes, do you feel like that’s not enough?V: Obviously it’s something and I’m happy about it, but I personally think because they just recently raped someone that they should be kicked off campus. But that’s just my opinion.VF: Talking to the dean of students, it sounded like that was an initial action to at least take an action instead of doing nothing. It obviously isn’t a good enough action.V: But I mean nothing is enough. I’m happy that they’re on social probation, I’m really happy this happened, but nothing is going to replace what I went through.BH: You delved into this a bit earlier, but can you just talk about why you decided to come forward?V: I was at a bar and I was talking to this guy and he was in Sigma Chi. My friend knew he was in Sigma Chi and comes up to me and says, “Hey, he’s in Sigma Chi.” But I didn’t really register it. So [my friends] were at another table saying they can’t believe I’m talking to a guy in Sigma Chi, and this girl comes over and says “Don’t let her talk to them. I was recently raped there by more than one person. Please don’t let her talk to him — they’re not OK.” So my friend comes over and says “Hey, he’s in Sigma Chi, come on.”So this girl wanted to talk to me, and she was raped [at Sigma Chi] the first or second week of this semester. She isn’t going to come forward, isn’t contacting police, because that’s what most rape victims do. But she was like, really, really upset. She was like bawling. And I think her friends contacted the dean of students, so the dean of students are aware someone else was raped there too. So I felt like even though I did everything in my power I felt like … I don’t want people to be like, “Oh my god, Sigma Chi, they’re so fun.” No. I want them to be known, I want people to hear Sigma Chi, and say, “Did you hear they raped someone?” I don’t want people to be like, “Yes, they’re awesome!” Not everyone within their fraternity is, but they do have rapists.VF: The thing that’s scary about it is that it seems like it’s a problem within their house, not just an isolated person, not just an isolated incident. Obviously if I was roofied almost a year ago at their house and two people have been raped there since, and we’ve only had one person come forward with it, it seems like there’s obviously other people. And the rapes were all with more than one person. And I understand how sororities and fraternities don’t really know the backgrounds of the people they offer membership to, but when it’s more than one person there’s obviously an internal issue with the fraternity itself. It’s not just one bad apple.BH: What was it like talking to this other victim? How did it make you feel?V: Honestly I almost threw up. It’s disgusting that people go through with this thing. Do you have a mother? Do you have a sister? Do you have friends who are girls? Imagine them getting raped — how the hell do you think you would react? I had guy friends and they were furious, they wanted to beat everybody up in that fraternity. How can you rape someone and not think of other women? And I felt like as a woman we’re all being targeted at this frat and this needs to stop. I did everything in my power to get something done, and nothing happened. And it made me sad, and it made me feel like this girl’s rape was my fault.BH: So your assault and this other girl’s assault are the two that you know of?V: Yeah.BH: You haven’t spoken to anybody else specifically, but you think it may just be a larger problem?V: Yeah.VF: Another thing, for me at least, the perpetrator in my incident, what makes the situation even more complicated, is that the person who dropped a pill in my drink is on the executive committee for the Interfraternity Council, which is like the governing body for the fraternities. … [A]nd if you want to bring a complaint against a fraternity, your complaint has to have all of your information on it, including your contact information, your house, your name. And the thing is that the people on the judicial board are all in fraternities and sororities, so that creates an issue with confidentially. The process for the judicial board has a statute of limitations is I believe 15 days post-incident, or 15 days after the start of the next semester, and obviously with something as traumatic as rape, a rape victim would not be ready to come forward to the judicial board non-anonymously with an issue within 15 days. That’s an unreasonable amount of time.This issue has been circulating throughout the Greek community since it happened. People have been speculating about it, but I guess one of the reasons that spurred me on to push this issue with the university is because it seems like people have thought of this as a rumor. And I guess people thought it was a rumor at one point, but nothing happened, and I know for a fact that the Pan-Hellenic Council and the Interfraternity Council both are aware that this occurred and not just that it was a rumor, so I guess the fact that they didn’t act quicker on it makes me really suspicious. And like I said, knowing that there’s two people on their executive committee from Sigma Chi makes me even more suspicious. Knowing that one of them is a potential rapist because he roofied my drink before makes it not surprising that they haven’t done anything.BH: And how does that make both of you feel that the power is kind of possibly in the hands of the perpetrators?VF: I think it’s just really scary. I mean, it’s kind of like the good ol’ boys network.V: Totally.VF: You know this person; I know that person; I’ve got your back. It just kind of suppresses all other outside voices like for the good of just protecting each other.V: I feel like it diminishes me as a rape victim. It’s saying, “Oh, you know what, that was something bad, but we don’t really care about it because it will ruin the Greek reputation. I feel like this thing is hidden because they don’t want to ruin our Greek system reputation because I feel like something like, “Oh, people get raped” is like, “Shh… don’t talk about it,” you know?It’s something people don’t want to hear about and don’t want to talk about and it really, honestly, them not saying something makes me feel like [they’re] saying, “Oh, it’s OK you got raped.” You know, “That sucks, but really no big deal.”BH: So, what kind of support have you received since the rape occurred, whether this is through the university or…V: No, it’s OK. I’m seeing a therapist. I have a therapist I go to every Friday. I have all my friends within where I live. They’ve been extremely supportive. Some haven’t been, but it shows their true colors. That’s kind of my support, and my family I guess. My family is like, very, everyone in my family knows and they haven’t been pressuring me to do anything. They’ve just been really supportive, and I feel that’s how my friends have been and same as my therapist.BH: Looking back, would you change anything either what you did afterwards or who you asked for help, or would you change any of your actions?V: I definitely would not have seen the dean of students I saw; I would have seen Suzanne. But I wasn’t like, I didn’t get to choose who my dean of students was, I just was contacted. I just felt like my dean of students wasn’t really empathetic at all to the situation.Like, she just [recently] called, because [the Herald] called her I’m assuming, and she was like, I said, “You know, I’m trading. I’m probably going to talk to Suzanne,” and she said, “Why?” and I said, “Because I felt like she actually did something,” and she said “Oh, you never said you wanted to do something.” She knew full well I was having a private investigator. Doesn’t that say you want to do something? I feel like it should have been asked, too. I was never asked, “Do you want them to get in trouble at all?” And honestly, it’s something they shouldn’t ask right away either. They should contact, like, you know, a month or two after. Maybe even like, it’s six months ago. October, November, December, January, February almost March. Six months ago and I’m just coming forward with my story, and I just felt like my dean of students wasn’t empathetic at all. She like yelled about me about my professor. I just wouldn’t go to her again — I think that would be the only thing I would change.BH: So do you feel the university could offer better services to people?V: Honestly, like also with the Rape Crisis Center, I know this has nothing to do with the university, but like they don’t tell you if you don’t collect, when you do it you’re in a room with them and they say, “You know you have the option to collect evidence which can be just put on hold and no ones going to have it,” like “We’ll have it, we’ll see it unless you decide to contact the police or you can just not get evidence.”And I felt more that they pushed you to not get evidence because getting evidence takes hours because they take pictures of your vagina, they take DNA, they have a total feel test, like they test if you were raped in the butt, all that stuff. I feel as if they encourage you [against getting the evidence]. Not like saying, “Oh no don’t do it,” but it’s more you’re pushed toward not collecting evidence, and I felt as if I didn’t have my mother there, I probably wouldn’t have done it.I feel like that maybe would be one thing to do. And honestly, people who are raped, right afterwards they are contacted — I don’t want to see anyone, I don’t want to talk to anyone about it. Like, maybe contact me in a month or two. Not right away because honestly I don’t want to talk to you. I want to be alone and secluded and pretty much be depressed.BH: OK, so I guess that kind of leads into how overall has this affected your life?V: My life is ruined because of this. I don’t trust anyone. I honestly feel as if I can’t be a normal college student anymore. I can’t go out and drink. I get only bottles because I cover up the hole because I am afraid someone is going to roofie me. I have roofie testers that I bring out every single time I go out and check if it was roofied and one time I was pregaming before a Badger game and one of the roofie tests came up positive. Like, how does that happen? Like, that shows that people around here have roofies, and it happens all the time. Maybe girls think they got blackout drunk. No, you got roofied, and I think people don’t really realize that.And I feel like I hate men right now. I’m not like a lesbian or anything, but it’s just like, how do I know that you’re a good guy? It’s like my whole perspective of life has changed. I don’t want to date someone. I don’t like really care anything for them right now. I think they’re pigs. I mean, my life is completely changed and ruined. Even my ex-boyfriend who I have complete faith in and stuff, I see him as an asshole, like as someone who’s disgusting.And it’s as if my whole aspect of life was taken away because of this. There are days I don’t want to get out of bed. I’ve never had that before in my life. I’ve never felt sad. I’m on depression medication, and that would have never happened. I’ve always felt happy and now there are days where I don’t feel happy.Like, I’m struggling to make myself look happy. It’s like as if I’m drowning and I’m treading water. Before I was under and now maybe I’m at my shoulder level. It’s just something that’s really difficult, and it’s also hard because I can’t sit and talk to you about it. You don’t know how I feel. You can’t be like, “Oh, I understand.” You don’t understand. Like I can’t sit and talk to anyone about it because no one understands how I feel, which is very frustrating. And it’s also frustrating because many rape victims don’t want to talk about it and be like, “Oh, you know?” All of us don’t have the same story. I went to a thing back at home … a group meeting, and most rape victims weren’t coming forward with who they knew, who their rapists were, weren’t contacting the police, thought it was their fault. I don’t relate to them because I don’t think it was my fault, and if I knew who it was I would be contacting the police. It’s honestly like they have taken away a part of me and I will never get that back.BH (to VF): OK. Do you have anything you can add, anything you’ve noticed?V: I’m not going to be offended. [Chuckles]VF: I think I have seen an extremely, I guess a really significant change in how she has been in terms of recovery from like when it happened until even now. I see that you are like so empowered to do something about it, and I think it’s amazing because it’s in such a short time period. Some people wait their whole lives or don’t ever tell anyone about this in their whole life and given the situation, you’ve done everything right and I think it’s a really amazing example for your friends, for people who this has happened to because, like you said, some of these people won’t come forward with it. And so just to be able to see someone who is strong and who is doing something about it and like how you said, people aren’t pressuring you to do it — it’s all you. You have the strength to do it.V: Yeah, it was my decision.VF: It’s been really an inspiring thing for me just to see that, and for me it’s also kind of a life-changing perspective to see such a close friend go through something like this. It’s going to impact and it already is the way I look at the world and just like, my friendships with people are so close I seriously feel peoples’ pain. It hurts me to see what you had to go through and so it also makes me feel like really strong to see you are moving forward with this and seeking the help you need with your therapist, and doing this interview is huge. This is a huge step for your recovery.V: Yeah. And also, just to comment, after it happened, like I used alcohol to help me, like, be numb. And when I saw that girl who was in the bar, she was bombed out of her mind because we don’t want to feel what we’re feeling. We want to be numb. I don’t want to think about it. … [But] I’m not drinking to get numb anymore. I’m OK.VF: I think that a lot of people underestimate the impact of rape.V: I completely, 100 percent agree with it. Someone in my sorority said, “Oh I thought you’d be better this semester.” Fuck you, like honestly, it is something that has changed my life and I won’t be able to just get over.VF: I think that is the main linkage in people not moving forward with this is that they don’t understand how serious it is. It’s like, “Oh well, that’s too bad that it happened. I’m really sorry to hear it.” And that is pretty much all they say; they don’t actually feel like the impact that it’s had. They don’t think of all the things. It’s like, “Oh that’s really too bad; that must have felt like horrible,” but if they don’t understand it’s not just a feeling that happens like from the next day. It’s like the next day and the next day for the rest of your life. Every second of your life you feel right what you felt right at the beginning. Like, right after it happened and people just like don’t get that. And its not just, “Oh, I’m afraid to go out,” it’s like, “Oh, I like don’t want to date people.” Like, it impacts the rest of your life, like how you raise your kids.V: And I also feel I have three girls out of probably the 40 [I live with] that I feel comfortable that actually care about, like, how I am and understand. Like, they’re, “Are you OK?,” not being like, “Hey, Oh, how was your day?” It’s “Are you okay?” It’s like three people, that actually, who actually get it, you know? I feel like that will be maybe a thing that embeds how most people don’t understand.BH: OK. And just to wrap up, what does campus need to know moving forward from this?V: What do you mean?BH: What do people on campus need to learn from your story?V: I mean, I feel as if people who get blackout drunk, it’s somewhat insulting to me, because it’s like you’re not being careful, and I was one of those people. I used to get wasted. You never think it will happen to you and it will. It can happen to you, and I feel as if people should be aware that this stuff does happen.It’s not just stuff you see in movies. It happens all the time, and most of it’s shushed up because that’s what as a society we’re taught to feel. [To VF] I don’t know, what else do you think I should say?VF: I feel like we’re talking about how we always used to go to Sigma Chi. Like even though you feel like you have a level of trust you can never be too careful.V: Yeah, even if you feel you have a level of trust with someone, you can never know who that person really is. Like, you never know, could that person be a rapist? And I know, probably sound a little, “Whoa, you’re paranoid,” but it’s true you don’t know, you really don’t know someone. We haven’t grown up with these people, we met them one or two years ago and a few years doesn’t really help you get to know someone at all.VF: I mean, with that house, we’ve spent a lot of time going to that house.V: Tons of time.VF: It’s not like we’re just random people off the street.V: We have a connection with them.VF: It’s not we would just randomly go there. [To V] Oh, also, wouldn’t you want to talk about like, how, who you go out with…V: Oh yeah, I didn’t add this part, but I went out that night I got raped with not people I was really close with. I feel as if you should go out with people who you are really close with. Make sure you are not going home with some random person. It’s like a buddy system that should be established in groups because this stuff, [VF] would never let me go home with someone who I don’t know. It’s changed our whole outlook on going out because you need to have someone who will watch you, not as a babysitter, but as a friend. I was out with people who didn’t care about me. I was left in what someone said was in Sigma Chi, and that girl who I was with, she said I was left playing beer pong with three guys. Like, who just leaves someone like that? The girl just left me, she was like, “I gotta go home,” and she left. And honestly, that’s fine, but looking back, I’m never going to do that to someone, because something could happen. I’m sure she thought, “Oh, you’re safe here, you’re fine, we know people here.” But you really just don’t know everybody. Girls, and maybe guys, you need to have someone to watch each other because you shouldn’t just go out with random people. [To VF] What do you think, anything else?VF: No, I think that’s good. I think someone also needs to address what’s making people act this way. First of all, people need to be empowered to stand up to them if this does happen, but there’s obviously a serious problem. The thing that’s kind of funny is it’s kind of like people stereotypically think of rapists as a creepy guy, like you know, shady character who is just lingering around bars preying on people.These are affluent guys. These are guys who got into this university, not uneducated guys, not guys who are [from] poor areas. I think that people just need to be aware it’s not just like the stereotype of a poor creepy person who’s lingering around like a transient. It’s normal people. It’s someone who you know. [Someone] you might be friends with could have done this.V: Like if a guy was sitting there (points), I would be like, “I don’t know if you’re a rapist.” Now, I’m very wary of all men in general. And that was taken from me, and I used to be very good friends with guys and now my only guy friend is a gay guy because I know he’s not going to rape me. It’s just something that I will never in my life get back. Like, I still take showers and still try to scrub myself off because I still feel dirty. Also with my body image, I feel like I am ugly, disgusting and obese.Like, I look in the mirror and see myself as ugly and fat and gross and I was never much like that before. I was a confident person and, yes, people still see that I am confident but that is a shield. I’m trying to show people I’m OK and it’s not how I’m acting really. I’m acting for other people and it’s something, I still feel violated.I got a pap smear and I was bawling the whole time. That is something that’s just, and I have a woman gyno, it’s something that affects my everyday life and I was sick last week and I have a guy doctor and they said, “You have to get in a gown” and I was like, “I’m not getting in a gown and can I have a girl doctor.” And they’re like “No, I’m sorry the only person who is here is a guy,” and I was like, “I’m not getting in a gown” and she was like, “No, you have to.” And I was like, “Well I was raped, I’m not getting in the gown.” And when the doctor had to feel for my heart I was [extremely uncomfortable] and that just shows you how it affects me because it’s a doctor who like sees stuff all the time and because he’s a male, I feel like he’s violating me.BH: That’s all my specific questions but is there anything else at all you would like to say?V: I don’t think so, what do you think?VF: Do you want to say anything at all about how it impacted your view of your faith?V: Oh yeah, I don’t know if you guys want to write about this, but I was a person who was very close with God and I feel as if, “Why did God do this to me?” It’s like, how could he let this happen, and now I don’t ever want to go to church. I don’t want to pray. I asked him, “How could you let this happen to me?” and it’s like that part of me is taken away, and that’s really sad because God was a comfort for me and, I still have never, I haven’t come to terms with him.I say to him, “I know you’re making me do this for some reason to help someone else, but why me?” You know what I’m saying? And like I think of that every day: Why did this happen to me? What did I do in my life to deserve this? They took away my faith and for me that was one of the most important things that was taken away from me because that’s something that I lean on and I can’t lean on this. I’m stuck in a fog here. I had all these things with me and I can barely see the light, it’s dim. I feel like I’m never going to get out of this.BH: Anything else?V: No.[End recording]Editor’s Note: The Herald did talk to the victim over the phone and in person outside of this interview for both articles.",Transcript of Herald’s interview with rape victim,UWM

This format provides a unique perspective of suicide by telling it through the lens of the one suffering.The stories told on each tape give raw and personal accounts of bullying, abuse and the effects they leave on a person. The format of the show also illustrates how bullying builds and each event slowly takes its toll until the victim can take no more.Line Breaks Festival fills void of diverse art offerings in Madison
The Line Breaks Festival returned to the University of Wisconsin April 11-16 to celebrate campus diversity and center the voices of Read…The show serves as a reminder that our actions and words are not without consequences, both positive and negative. No one person killed Hannah, but all of them together left her feeling lost and alone.Throughout the show, as Hannah recounts these difficult memories, she often notes she wished they had fought a little harder for her. This is an important message because it demonstrates that even in her darkest hour, she still had hope that someone would step in and stop her, encouraging viewers to be more attentive to the people in their own life. She didn’t want to die, but she felt no one cared enough to notice the signs and intervene.“13 Reasons Why” is tough to watch and though it is made for entertainment, it’s bringing to light highly emotional and painful realities in a very raw way. Graphic scenes of rape, suicide and violence give viewers a look into the worst of human suffering.Some episodes begin with warnings of graphic content, but the subject matter in every episode is difficult and should be watched with discretion as some scenes can be triggering without warning.Selena Gomez is one of the show’s executive producers. Gomez has dubbed the series a “passion project” of hers and has been public with her own struggles with depression and anxiety. She has stated that she hopes the show helps young adults understand suicide and bullying in order to prevent it and help loved ones.StoriesEtc: Allusion to past, tastes of modernity in face of poverty
Welcome to StoriesEtc, a place where University of Wisconsin students can share their original works of creative writing with the Read…“13 Reasons Why” certainly sends a message. I finished the series feeling emotionally drained and more aware of my actions and thoughts. I find myself more attentive to the people around me and the impact I have on others with every encounter.This is what the show wants — to enlighten viewers on the everyday sufferings of someone dealing with depression and bring it to the forefront of discussion in hopes that those suffering can get help, and those not can better understand.If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or visit 13reasonswhy.info for resources and information.","’13 Reasons Why’ illustrates dangers of bullying, unique perspective on suicide",UWM

This is comparable to the success rate as other commonly used antidepressants on the market which, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, is at around 30 percent.What has set ketamine apart from other drugs is that it starts to show effects in patients within hours of consumption with few side-effects, Wired Magazine contributor Moises Velazques-Manof wrote.This research, however, has come with pushback and doubt from both the public and medical community.Ketamine, when abused, can be highly addictive, and aside from its recreational uses, the drug has also come to be known as an effective date-rape drug due to its hallucinogenic properties.Hospital adds two new programs for those suffering with PTSD, mood disorders
In March, Rogers Memorial Hospital will add two new programs to provide treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, depression, bipolar Read…On campus, according to the University of Wisconsin Police Department, there has not been a presence of ketamine, or at least not enough to raise concern within the police department.“We have been lucky that the campus has not seen a large presence of date-rape drugs like ketamine used for those purposes,” UWPD communications director Mark Lovicott said.According to a report made by JAMA Psychiatry on the use of ketamine in mood disorders, aside from the public concern on ketamine, prolonged usage could potentially have physical side-effects like high blood-pressure due to the lack of long-term research.Regardless of the unsettledness, Garlow said the benefits and successes of this treatment give it more of a merit than a fault.“I went into this with a high degree of skepticism,” Garlow said. “My expectation was that we will treat a couple of patients, prove to myself that it doesn’t work and then move on from it. Most of the group of the first 10 or so patients we treated with it had really good responses to it.”Ketamine for medical use is also not uncommon. According to an essay written by researchers in the University of Michigan on the evolvement of ketamine since it’s discovery, it has been approved by the FDA and used as an anesthetic, even for children, since the 1970s.Joe Parisi announces increased funds for mental health, addiction services in 2019

Any of the “high” effects the drug has would wear off prior to leaving the medical building — patients who are going through this treatment are not doing it to get high; they are severely depressed candidates whose only goal is to get better, Garlow said.“For the patients that I have treated, that part [of the drug] has never come up,” Garlow said. “They don’t view it in any way recreationally … the ones that it has worked for, they are very respectful and protective of it because they’re better.”His patients worry that the negative views on ketamine may delay the process for the medicine to become more readily available.Though it is uncertain why this drug works, there are currently several ongoing research projects into ketamine’s treatment of other health issues like ketamine as a rapid Treatment for PTSD, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense, Ketamine Infusion for Social Anxiety Disorder, sponsored by Yale University and Ketamine for Chronic Pain, sponsored by the Netherlands Department of Anesthesiology.As far as future plans and a timeline for ketamine to become more accessible as an antidepressant, Janssen Pharmaceuticals is currently in the process of getting FDA approval on a synthesized version of ketamine for treating depression.“This could be passed and available as early as next year,” Garlow said.",Ketamine fosters new hope in medical community as antidepressant,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2009/09/01/woman-sues-sigma-chi/,"Sep 1, 2009","Sigma Chi\’s Madison chapter is now the subject of a recent lawsuit regarding a student\’s alleged rape.[/media-credit]As the Milwaukee County Circuit Court awaits a response to the lawsuit filed earlier this summer relating to the alleged rape at the University of Wisconsin Sigma Chi house last fall, ongoing and past cases may provide clues for future proceedings of the suit.The civil lawsuit was filed by Milwaukee attorney Robert Elliot July 17 on behalf of a UW student who first told The Badger Herald in February she had been drugged and raped multiple times at the Sigma Chi house in the early morning of Oct. 5, 2008.The suit names the UW chapter of Sigma Chi, its national office and its insurer as defendants in the case, stating the local chapter neglected to maintain a safe place for guests, leading to the woman’s injuries.The suit also says Sigma Chi national headquarters did not maintain control over individual chapters, even after more than a dozen criminal complaints were made against chapters nationwide since 1987.The woman, who is identified as “Jane Doe” in the suit, is seeking punitive damages as well as compensatory damages from each of the defendants, according to the suit.Peer cases are progressingSigma Chi chapters at University of Nebraska-Lincoln and University of Georgia are currently involved in court proceedings. While according to UW Law professor Shubha Ghosh cases like these could not be used as precedence for the Milwaukee suit, they could be used to establish legal facts to document a pattern of negligence by the national fraternity.The University of Georgia chapter is currently facing two lawsuits stemming from events in the early morning of Sept. 27, 2008, when a woman suffered extensive injuries from a fall.Like in the Milwaukee case, the woman has since sued for compensatory and punitive damages. Both cases partially rest on premises liability, which works to establish a legal obligation for the houses to be safe for guests.The Milwaukee suit says under Wisconsin statute, the UW Sigma Chi house should be classified as a public residence, making it responsible for its guests. While it is unknown if the alleged rape at the UW chapter was performed by Sigma Chi members, under the statute the house would still be responsible for the woman’s safety.The Georgia suit, however, is able to go into further detail to establish negligence by the house, citing the serving of alcoholic drinks to minors and lofted beds without railings, from where the victim fell, as preventable dangers.Where’s the legal responsibility?The Milwaukee suit names 14 previous cases against Sigma Chi chapters nationally to show “for a number of years prior to Oct. 4, 2008 [the national organization] has known that it has failed to even minimally discharge the duties it has undertaken to supervise and control the actions of [the UW chapter] and [the insurer] and their members….”One particular case named involves a New York woman raped at the Sigma Chi chapter of Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. in 1987. While Boston Globe archives from the period indicate the three men — none of them Sigma Chi members — indicted on rape charges did not serve jail time, the woman later filed a $5 million civil suit against Colgate and the fraternity in 1989. The Milwaukee suit states the woman was awarded an out-of-court settlement from the two parties.Like the Milwaukee case, individuals allegedly responsible for the rape were not listed in the suit as the Colgate woman was found unable to properly identify them due to her intoxication at the time of the assault. Instead, the case alleged negligence on behalf of the university and fraternity.Unlike the Milwaukee case, the Colgate woman was able to say without a doubt the rape took place in the Colgate Sigma Chi house. The UW woman was unconscious throughout the assault and can only say she awoke in the UW Sigma Chi house before discovering she was injured.UW law professor Peter Carstensen said the woman is now tasked with providing enough evidence that the judge and jury can conclude her injuries occurred while she was present in the house.He said this will have to be partially based on inferences of who did wrong, and the court will then have to decide what the owner of the house should have done differently.Next, Carstensen said it is a matter of determining what the fraternity’s responsibility should be and the fact Sigma Chi houses non-members could play a role in that.Because the fraternity is different from an apartment, Carstensen said it could be argued the building owner was more responsible for checking the background of people on its premises.“That would point toward creating more legal responsibility and makes it easier for the victim to say, ‘You were negligent with respect to my injury because you didn’t check out your residents, as well as your members,'” Carstensen said. “The counterargument is, ‘Gee, we don’t know who did the harm, it may be someone we were responsible for or someone we were not.'”An ongoing process in Milwaukee and MadisonAs the defendants in the Milwaukee case were given a 45-day period to respond to the lawsuit, their answer is due back this week.As of last week, Sigma Chi International Fraternity Executive Director Michael Dunn said the national organization was going through an investigative process before responding.“At this point in time, I know of nothing that the criminal side of the investigation has come up with,” Dunn said “This is a civil suit, so until we get through that process we’re going to work with the university and the criminal organizations there and figure it out.”The UW chapter of Sigma Chi and its insurer could not be reached for comment.The woman and Elliot have both stated to the Herald they are not speaking to media on the case.The University of Georgia suit: 72409frat_suit.pdfThe University of Madison suit: 1197_001.pdf",Woman sues Sigma Chi,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2009/12/04/the-bravery-fails-to/,"Dec 4, 2009","Considering its pretentiously dark title, Stir the Blood, The Bravery’s latest album is kind of a letdown. The cover art, which features ravenous birds shadowed by a black background, seemed more promising than the generic music it contained.Stir the Blood is like a combination of mediocre ’80s club music and The Cure (although that may be attributed to the fact that lead vocalist Sam Endicott sounds quite similar to Robert Smith — their voices share that drawling quality). Overall, Stir the Blood is perfect music for a techno club or an obscure house party. The songs have the ability to discreetly bleed together with no discernable distinction among them. And for all purposes such as dancing on a Saturday night, that’s just fine. Beyond this, however, the album is rather lacking in aesthetic value.Few songs are very catchy, while everything else just has a good beat. In certain songs Endicott even seems to attempt profoundness with his lyrics, but their vagueness and ambiguity trump his effort. The song “HateFuck,” for instance, is racy, provocative and possibly about rape, containing lines such as “You can tear your nails into my skin/ You won’t stop me” and “Naked and breathless/ Could you live with this disgrace?” Oddly enough, these shockingly blatant lyrics are presented so nonchalantly that one could passively listen to this song and completely gloss over its meaning.In two of the songs on the album, and for roughly 20-second intervals, The Bravery attempts to redeem somewhat of a rock ‘n’ roll status with legitimate (albeit incredibly brief) guitar solos. In addition to this are a few token songs that break away from the party dynamic. “She’s So Bendable” is a sweet and mellow song with simplistic lyrics and an incredibly chilled-out melody. The fact that it is sandwiched between two rave songs, however, is puzzling and lessens its effect. Such is also the case for the CD’s closing track, “Sugar Pill,” whose placid tune and lyrics toy with the concept of a drug-altered state of mind, even dropping a “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” reference, “I have kaleidoscope eyes.” It is difficult to comprehend why an album that is predominantly electronica party music would choose to end with a psychedelic soft-rock song. If Stir the Blood is an album of the generic party sort, why did the band choose to slip in random and spontaneous bits of music that conflict with this idea?It would seem The Bravery’s aim with this new album was to appeal to the masses. But there were points in the album when they failed to commit to that aim. The fact that these rare and shining moments even exist demonstrates the musicians’ obvious capacity for greatness, but they stop themselves short by keeping these moments as modest as possible. Because these songs are clearly targeted at a generic audience and non-specific clubbing atmosphere, they are wanting for uniqueness and originality. When The Bravery made the decision to appeal to the most mainstream of listeners, they simultaneously surrendered and stifled their creative potential.2 stars out of 5.",The Bravery fails to ‘Stir the Blood’,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2015/03/20/marina-and-the-diamonds-live-up-to-hype-with-self-empowered-new-album/,"Mar 20, 2015","Whether her title is idol, role model or spirit animal, Marina Diamandis has been dubbed a variety of respectable names. Collectively, they reflect the incomparable adoration of her fiercely loyal fan base. Otherwise known under her stage moniker, Marina and the Diamonds, it is no secret the electro-pop princess has touched the lives of her fans with extremely relatable and almost therapeutic music, not to mention its breathless catchiness.This past Monday, Diamandis unleashed 12 tracks worth of inspiration and remarkable strength. The third album from the 29-year-old Welsh singer-songwriter, Froot, gifted listeners with a raw, effortless and fearless set of tracks, communicating words of reflection and empowerment.This sentiment exemplifies a major narrative shift from Diamandis’ previous album, Electra Heart. While Electra Heart was written from the shoes of her intentionally insipid and fame obsessed alter ego, Diamandis takes the opportunity in Froot to knock down pop music’s superficial walls. As a result, the “real” Marina and the Diamonds has now come forward.This shift into introspective contemplation is especially reflected in the opening ballad “Happy,” in which she softly sets the story for the rest of her tracks. It is an appropriate umbrella for the remainder of Froot to fall under. Diamandis laces herself in a vulnerable, naked spotlight and openly vocalizes her challenges seeking identity.Yet, she emerges as victorious, crooning, “I believe in possibility, I believe someone’s watching over me, and finally I have found a way to be happy.”Other tracks reflect Diamandis’ unique musicianship. Songs like “Blue” and “Forget” are upbeat but convey a sense of agitation. “Forget” seems to serve as a continuation of one of Diamandis’ older songs, “Teen Idle.” The melodies, keys and rhythms are similar as well as the type of story. However, “Forget” remains different in its more optimistic take on life’s inevitable struggle than the somber, slightly fearful nature of “Teen Idle.” Regret, confusion and entrapment are no more. Instead it is “time to forget.”The title track, “Froot,” is extremely reminiscent of Electra Heart, in addition to Diamandis’ first album, The Family Jewels. She stays true to her distinct New Wave style, complete with synth and colorful dance beats. The instrumentals sound as if they emerged straight from an old arcade video game, an entrancing number made even more hypnotic with sultry mezzo vocals. It is clear Diamandis is liberated and in pursuit of her new object of desire. Her characteristic lyrical nature remains, referring to her back and forth, combative inner dialogue. However, despite this, a confident air and assurance prevails that serves as a subtle, yet effective undertone.Perhaps the album’s most notable work comes with the second to last track, “Savages.” Diamandis draws on the prevalence of rape culture. The song kindles the idea that inherent vice exists.“Underneath it all, we’re just savages, hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages / How could we expect anything at all, we’re just animals still learning how to crawl.”These chilling lyrics possess a startling amount of intuition and provocation. While it is a change of pace from self-discovery to universal challenges, it still corroborates the theme of the album.The final track, “Immortal,” also possesses haunting lyrics and melody. As if dipped in molasses, the song is all the more effective. Diamandis mulls over the hushed fear of post-mortem oblivion, weaving it into the album’s stunning finale.Froot has allowed Diamandis to continue validating the high hopes of her loyal fan base, stacking up to the overwhelming pre-release hype. It is an introspective take into her personal life, as well as the greater issues and questions of society. She has, without hesitation, delivered a brilliant compilation. Her extraordinary courage to place herself in a position of vulnerability is both inspiring and entertaining. With Froot, Marina and the Diamonds will continue to uphold her incomparable status among fans across the world.",Marina and the Diamonds live up to hype with self-empowered new album,UWM

Now, the Chimera program at the Rape Crisis Center in Madison is the last existing chapter in the country .The classes are dispersed sporadically throughout the year and average 15 people per class, but the cap is 25, DeMaioribus said.

There are no drop-ins or observers, and the classes are strictly women only.“Often it’s a very intense, emotional place for people who take the class,” DeMaioribus said. “It’s really important this is a safe place for them to express their fears and deal with their emotions with the larger group.”The classes teach a variety of self-defense techniques, DeMaioribus said. Chimera does not focus on giving students a “script” to follow based on specific situations, but rather provides a variety of tools so that people have options to build-up their own defenses.Chimera teaches physical techniques, like strikes and ground-fighting, which can be utilized in a violent or physical confrontation, DeMaioribus said. It also teaches hold-breaking, moves designed to break free from an attacker.

Among his top concerns are combating voter suppression laws, addressing the opioid epidemic, undoing rape-kit backlogging and environmental regulation enforcement.Kaul made an ostensible effort to engage playfully with the mostly young, democratic crowd, opening with one of his favorite jokes, “I’m Josh Kaul and I’m not running for governor.”This comment was a nod to the almost 20 Democrats running for the 2018 gubernatorial race in Wisconsin.

Attendees of the Democratic watch Read…Kaul believes much of the Republican leadership in the state is responsible for different forms of voter suppression targeted specifically at young and minority voters. He linked these issues to greater issues of inequality specifically facing black communities in Wisconsin, citing Milwaukee’s high rate of black male unemployment and the prevalence of gerrymandering across the country as examples of this inequality.“[Republicans] know that the harder you make it to vote, the less people will turn out to vote,” Kaul said.Voter ID laws are another way Republicans have made it harder for younger voters — who tend to vote Democratic — to vote, Kaul said. He also pointed to previous Republican-led rollbacks on the requirement for high schools to have someone qualified to register new voters.Kaul said one of the issues that he finds most critical in Wisconsin is protecting environmental regulations. He focused on enforcing laws that would cut down on drinking water contamination and ensure access to clean water for all Wisconsinites.“I don’t think anybody in Wisconsin in 2018 should worry that when they turn on the tap, brown water is going to come out,” Kaul said.State Attorney General argues Wisconsin has strong case to win redistricting challenges

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2017/05/03/hump-day-the-nuances-of-sex-positivity/,"May 3, 2017","After three years of writing Hump Day, I have finally come to my final piece. I would like to take this moment to thank each and every reader that has ever laid eyes on my writing — yes, including those that found it vulgar or offensive.Writing Hump Day means a great deal to me, and it is with a heavy heart that I pass the torch on to the next columnist as I graduate. Over the years, my column has grown from roots based in sex-positivity. Although sex-positivity does not define my beliefs, it does inform them. My stance on most facets of sexuality — including kink, non-monogamy, experimentation and pleasure — stems from sex-positivity.At its core, sex-positivity promotes and embraces sexual activity and expression preceded by consent and accompanied by necessary protection (barrier methods, birth control, etc.). Sex-positivity supports comprehensive sex education and safer sex as tools of the movement to allow individuals to be knowledgeable and empowered in decisions regarding sexuality.Hump Day: Get the scoop on scissoring
Scissoring has garnered quite a bit of attention in the spotlight recently: Poussey tried (and dismissed) it with her German Read…These values combat an overwhelmingly sex-negative society that wishes to subjugate and control sexuality, particularly that of women as well as queer and trans folks. Sex-positivity also endorses consent culture: encouraging and normalizing explicit consent between partners for all activities and respecting lack of consent. Importantly, sex-positivity only concerns sex. Without consent, sex is rape, and thus falls completely outside the boundaries of sex-positivity.Sex-positivity is not about having sex; abstinent and asexual folks are included in sex-positivity’s perspective that people should only engage in sexual activity that they agree with and actively desire.Choice is essential to sex-positivity. And although the sex-positive movement has been touted mainly by women, its philosophies also apply to men, who are frequently told that being a “real man” entails constantly wanting sex. Sex-positivity recognizes that this is a function of harmful hypermasculinity and challenges its basis in patriarchy. Above all else, sex-positivity attempts to eradicate unnecessary and damaging judgement of sexual activity while providing information and acceptance to anyone who wants it.Despite my overwhelming alignment with the notion of sex-positivity, its philosophy leaves much to be desired when taken at face value. Just like everything else, sex-positivity is nuanced, and becomes problematic when applied broadly or without critique.Too often, self-identified sex-positive people make the sweeping generalization that all sex is good sex as long as consent is present. But consensual acts can be troublesome as well. Maybe the sex is consensual, but it’s objectifying and leaves an individual feeling lonelier than ever. Maybe the sex is consensual, but someone experiences body dysmorphia and sexual activity makes it worse.Just because something is empowering to one person does not mean it empowers everyone. Sex-positivity is hardly ever culturally competent, so it is important for sex-positive white folks to check their privilege and realize that their sexuality is allowed to exist in ways that black, Latina or Asian people are not afforded.  In addition, we do not make sexual choices in a vacuum. Sex-positivity supports autonomous choices, but it is entirely impossible to remove ourselves from all the invasive, cisnormative and heteronormative ideals that we’ve been marinating in our entire lives. Preferences are fine, but they are influenced by the culture we grow up in.For example, if someone enjoys facials (ejaculating on a partner’s face, stereotypically a woman), that’s just fine with explicit consent. However, facials must be understood in the context of a patriarchal society that sexually degrades women.Hump Day: From diapers or daddies, age play explores it all
As college students on the cusp of adulthood, childhood seems like a blissful stage in our development: nap time, adults Read…Subscribers of mainstream sex-positivity do not always understand the movement with sufficient context, and that includes existing within a white supremacy. Sex-positivity as defined by white people often does not translate to people of color, especially given the pervasive sexualization of non-white people in the media and pornography.Sex-positivity does not exist in the same form among all people who subscribe to it. Those who proclaim themselves to be sex-positive must make an effort to examine their ideals and ensure that it takes context and culture into account.

On their last album alone, there were songs called “Last Dance,” “Suicide,” “Gone Forever” and “Boys Who Rape (Should All Be Destroyed).” From the titles and lyrics, these songs sound awfully depressing, but they are transformed by the talented duo into pop masterpieces with buoyant choruses and knowing lyrics that wed melancholy and euphoria like a lyrical teenager’s diary.The band’s new LP, Raven in the Grave, keeps the melancholy but does away with the euphoria, presenting a more sober, somber, at times outright depressing outlook on life. The themes are the same: heartbreak, death, young lovers enduring catastrophe etc., but the hooks are dialed down, and there aren’t as many tracks to dance to.The song that most perfectly captures the new ethos is “Summer Moon.” Over a distorted piano crawl, Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo sing a duet about the fate of young lovers who meet happily and … well, the key rhyme in the song is composed of “crying” and “dying,” so it’s pretty easy to imagine what happens to the young lovers.Album closer “My Time’s Up” is similarly slow and – as you may have guessed from the title – similarly depressing, as the two singers muse about everyone’s death, including theirs. The song is lovely, sad and single-minded, with plenty of airy guitar solos jam-packed into its second half.“Evil Seeds” is no less harrowing but adds some heavy rock flair, with big drums and bigger guitar chords powering a song about betrayal that Moz fans could easily jam out to at an arena concert. “When I’m gone, like a raven in the grave, young lovers shriveled, spring from these evil seeds,” sings Wagner, reminding us of the most graphic images from Charles Burns’ “Black Hole.”The most danceable track, “Ignite,” best imitates the more uplifting sound of previous albums, and it’s a bit of a relief to find something non-sepulchral, although lyrics about exploding hearts are still present. The chorus is catchy, with handclaps and an attitude that remains authoritative even in the midst of despair.Despite the repetitive tenebrosity of the lyrics, The Raveonettes demonstrate throughout the album that, whatever their hang-ups, they can still write powerful songs. They do a great job with the simple “Let Me On Out,” which documents the travails of a couple that doesn’t communicate well. Wagner wails “how we loved, how we tried and how we fell apart” with real power, while Foo’s backing vocals drone on, as if she’s not understanding a thing that he says.The band is frequently compared to The Jesus and Mary Chain – something to do with sweet pop vocals over heavy rock distortion – but on Raven they sound equally like navel-gazing Canadian rock outfit Stars. Gloomy pontificating plus sweet voices plus noise pop has been a recipe for success before, and Wagner and Foo milk the formula for all it’s worth here.As any music fan knows, there are records for when you’re sad and records for when you’re happy. With Raven in the Grave, The Raveonettes have made an excellent record for when you’re depressed, angsty, melancholy or sad and one that would be nearly impossible to listen to when you’re happy.3.5 out of 5 stars",‘Raven in the Grave’ revives catchy angst,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2009/12/15/the-lovely-bones-sao/,"Dec 15, 2009","Almost as surprising as the drastic weight loss and subsequent physical transformation of the once stout, unkempt and bespectacled director Peter Jackson (“King Kong”) from a few years back, was his jarring decision to adapt Alice Sebold’s best selling novel, “The Lovely Bones” into a feature film.Prominently known for his adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy as well as his remake of “King Kong,” the Academy Award winning director’s cinematic interpretation of Sebold’s quiet and poignant literary original is regarded by critics as something of an anomaly among his trademark oeuvre that boasts action-packed, larger-than-life blockbusters.This time around, Jackson exchanges his proclivity for warfare and adventure for emotionally-charged drama in an endeavor to recount the unusual coming-of-age story of 14-year-old Susie Salmon (Saoirse Ronan, “City of Ember”), who, in her afterlife, follows and contemplates the tragedy of her rape, murder and dismemberment as her sadistic killer (Stanley Tucci, “Julie & Julia”) and grief-stricken family members — played by Mark Wahlberg (“Max Payne”), Rachel Weisz (“The Brothers Bloom”) and Susan Sarandon (“Solitary Man”) — continue on with their lives on earth.Most audiences will recognize actress Saoirse Ronan for her Academy Award nominated performance as the serious and self-important wisp of a girl, Briony Tallis, in Joe Wright’s (“The Soloist”) critically acclaimed “Atonement.”In a recent conference call with The Badger Herald, Ronan — in a pert yet solemn voice that was lightly peppered with an Irish accent — carefully addressed her unwarranted reputation of harboring a penchant for the dark and serious.“I’m not particularly attracted to dark roles,” Ronan professed. “But I love the depth to them. I love just their thinking process, I suppose — especially with ‘Atonement.’ And it just, you know, it takes a lot of thinking to really understand those kinds of characters. There [are] a lot of parts now where it’s very easy to just be the happy girl, and you know, there are some great characters at the moment who are more than that, and who are also very uplifting, like Susie Salmon.”Ronan also remedied the misconception that the tragic premises of the “The Lovely Bones” would evoke themes of death and despair.“I think that the message of this movie, although it may not seem like it to people who haven’t seen it yet, is ultimately hope, and how you get there,” Ronan declared. “It’s about her love for her family and not the hate and vengeance that she has for her murderer.”Ronan later confessed to have never studied Sebold’s bestseller before undertaking her role as the murdered teenage girl.“I actually waited to read the book after I had made the movie,” Ronan admitted. “I just really wanted to focus on the screenplay version, and also I felt like I was a little bit too young to read it at the time; I was 13. … The book is a little bit more visual and a bit more violent than the film so it just made sense.”Indeed, Jackson’s book-to-movie adaptation is rumored to have omitted Susie’s rape scene — one that, in the novel, is detailed with quiet violence and crafted with haunting poeticism.“If anything, [the absence of the rape scene] makes [the movie] stronger because I think it’s kind of the easy route to put that kind of scene in,” Ronan claimed. “It can make people uncomfortable. It can make people too disturbed. … The tasteful way to do it, I think, is to just leave it up to the audience’s imagination and to let them think of it for themselves, and sometimes that can even be stronger. So, no, I don’t think it took away from the story at all.”More on par with Jackson’s directorial forte is his portrayal of the “in-between,” or rather, Susie’s personalized, God-free, computer-generated heaven.“It was … a little bit surreal at first because it was all blue screen and I hadn’t worked with that much blue screen before,” Ronan admitted. “And most of heaven was going to be put in afterwards. So, it was sometimes difficult to try and imagine what it was going to be like, what it was going to look like. … I saw the movie a few days ago and it was a lovely surprise to finally see heaven.”“I just really hope that everyone enjoys it,” Ronan said. “That they connect to it as much as they did with the book. So, if awards come as well, then that’s brilliant.”“The Lovely Bones” is now playing in select theaters and is scheduled to be released worldwide on January 15, 2010.",The Lovely Bones: Saoirse Ronan interview,UWM

The bill, which Sen. David Craig, R-Vernon, and Rep. André Jacque, R-De Pere, introduced the first week of February, will prevent GIB from contracting or paying for abortion services, Jacque said in a co-sponsorship memo.If passed, the 250,000 public sector employees GIB covers will need to pay for their own abortion services, unless it is a case of rape or incest, or if the mother’s life is in danger.Wisconsin law prohibits Medicaid and Affordable Care Act from covering the cost of abortion services, Matt Sande, Pro-Life Wisconsin legislative director, said.State Rep. Ron Tusler, R-Harrison, said the bill will provide “equity” so that “taxpayers are not funding abortions for any group of people in Wisconsin.” “[This bill] goes in line with the same type of thought — if we’re not allowing people on Medicare to use insurance to purchase abortions, why would we allow government employees to do the same thing?” Tusler said.Legislation banning state funds from going toward abortion forces many women to pay for procedure out-of-pocket
As conservative efforts across the country have limited access to abortion clinics, the question of whether or not recent legislation Read…Tusler said the bill is different from past legislation defunding clinic abortion services in that this bill is not stopping anyone from getting an abortion. It is simply removing abortion from insurance plans and stopping tax money from going toward abortions. People can still get abortions but they will not be insured.But state Rep. Lisa Subeck, D-Madison, said in a statement the bill interferes with women’s access to reproductive health care and “decisions that should be made by a woman and her doctor.” She said the bill “throw[s] women under the bus.”“Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for putting women’s health and safety in jeopardy,” Subeck said.A similar bill was introduced in 2013 before dying in the state Senate. But this time Tusler said he expects the bill to pass because of wider support in the Legislature.Anti-abortion groups Pro-Life Wisconsin and Right to Life Wisconsin expressed their support for the bill and the idea that taxpayer dollars should not be funding abortions. Sande said though abortion is a legal right, it is not the government’s responsibility to fund it. “If you object to abortion, you should not have your taxpayer dollars going to such a practice,” Chelsea Shields, Wisconsin Right to Life legislative director, said.Why does Wisconsin’s abortion rate keep dropping?
For the sixth year in the row, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported the number of abortions performed dropped, Read…In an email to The Badger Herald, Nicole Safar, director of government relations for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin, called blocking women from safe, legal abortions “shameful.”Legislators should focus on their job creation promises and stop working to end insurance coverage for important medical care, Safar said.“Abortion is a deeply personal medical decision that should be made by a woman in consultation with her doctor, her family and her faith,” Safar said.Both Shields and Sande agree pro-life taxpayers shouldn’t have to compromise their conscience by funding abortion services. Sande said in addition to protecting people’s conscience rights Pro-Life Wisconsin wants to see the state move forward with encouraging alternatives to abortion, like easing adoption processes.Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Right to Life have asked legislators to sign on as co-sponsors to the bill. Tusler said the campaign to co-sponsor the bill has been “strong.”“I feel there’s strong public support and a strong co-sponsorship,” Sande said. “And you will see action on this bill.”Wisconsin now has only two Planned Parenthood abortion clinics

But not long after the video went viral, media outlets began looking into Dao’s past.Soon, reports detailing Dao’s past transgressions were popping up in the news.Character assassination of people of color in the media leads to spike in racially charged violence
My heart sank twice late Monday night as I scrolled by a Facebook status linked to a story about a Read…These reports transformed Dao from the United Airlines customer who had been brutally dragged off an airplane after doing nothing wrong into someone who may have deserved to be treated in this heinous manner. Dao became the doctor with a “troubled past.” By bringing up irrelevant facts about Dao, much of the coverage of the incident was likely clouded in readers’ minds because somehow, the coverage implied, Dao deserved the treatment he had received.Dao’s case isn’t the first time that media has used irrelevant details about a person’s life in their coverage. Brock Turner, the man who was discovered raping an unconscious woman laying outside a dumpster after a frat party in 2016, was constantly referred to not as “the man who was discovered raping an unconscious woman laying outside a dumpster,” but as “Stanford swimmer Brock Turner.” After weeks of media coverage of the case peppered with highlights of Turner’s swimming career, a smiling yearbook photo of Turner in place of a mugshot from the night of the crime, and a letter from Turner’s father reducing his son’s crime to “twenty minutes of action,” a judge sentenced him to only six months in jail, later shortened to a mere three months for good behavior.These situations are not the only examples of media outlets using framing to justify the use of violence or to explain away cases where our criminal justice system has failed victims. Indeed, it seems the media was working overtime to justify the murders of Alton Sterling because he had a past criminal record, Trayvon Martin because he had a small amount of marijuana in his system, just to name a few.Character assassination of people of color in the media leads to spike in racially charged violence

By bringing up irrelevant details about the histories of victims of state violence, the public will continue to feel that murdering an American citizen without a trial is at least somewhat justified.Until we hold the media accountable and insist that news outlets paint a more accurate picture of police violence and the ways our system privileges some citizens over others, Americans will never be able to come together and agree that our justice system is in desperate need of change.Julia O’Donnell (julesyann19@gmail.com) is a senior majoring in journalism and strategic communication.",It’s time for the media to stop framing victims as ‘deserving’ of the crime,UWM

Indeed, Christian chastity in particular traditionally entails sexual abstinence (or protection from rape), specifically before and outside marriage.The historical association with chastity is steeped in problematic meaning. Kink turns history upside down —instead of a tool meant to prevent temptation, the modern chastity device plays with temptation and uses it as a tool of submission.Currently, most chastity belts are used in the BDSM (Bondage/Discipline, Domination/Submission, Sadism/Masochism) community to dominate a submissive partner, teasing them by preventing erection and touching.Today, worldwide purchasing demand for penis chastity devices surpasses chastity belts for vulvas — in fact, recent popularity and internet access has led to a wide array of options for those interested in a little erotic denial.Hump Day: bringing sexy back to barriers
Despite the obvious benefits of barrier methods as preventative measures against sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancy, lots of folks Read…Of course, varsity-level kink requires varsity-level R.A.C.K.— risk-aware consensual kink. Using physical devices attached to power and control in the bedroom are varsity-level kinky tools, which entail both emotional and physical risks.All participants should educate themselves about devices and risk. Urologists recommend keeping the device on for no more than four to six hours, so don’t sleep in a chastity cage.Blood restriction toys in general should not be worn for more than thirty minutes at a time, so a boner (i.e., restricted blood flow) should get some breathing room every once in a while if getting flaccid proves difficult.Kinksters call this a “scene” for a reason — they have a script, too. Scripts require a discussion of desire: how do we want to be teased with a chastity device? No matter the script, each scene begins with consent — discussion of boundaries, permission and a safe word.Power play in kink sometimes mirrors abuse apart from consent, so “consensual non-consent” means an understanding that “no” does not mean “no,” rather a safe word does. No one should ever be in a sexual situation where they cannot stop all activity, whether “vanilla” or kinky. And no one should participate in kink because they feel pressured. Discuss safe words ahead of time, and pick something that wouldn’t come up during a scene, either in the physical space or prewritten script.Hump Day: Why scheduling sex doesn’t have to kill spontaneity
As the semester heats up and schedules become crowded with class, work and whatever other nonsense, intimacy may seem like Read…(NSFW = Not Safe For Work. Links contain real genitalia modeling products.)Popular chastity devices enclose the penis, making erection uncomfortable or impossible, preventing masturbation and other forms of sexual activity.A chastity cage usually consists of a ring that fits around the base of the penis attached to the cage portion by a hinge or pin and secured with a lock. Kinky “keyholders” and subs alike use all sorts of materials, including plastic, leather and stainless steel. Plastic allows visibility, leather is aesthetically appealing to many kinky folks and steel provides both security and temperature contrast against the warm skin of an erect penis.Cages include a hole at the tip for urination, but stimulation should be impossible. Some cages twist or bend the penis to add a little pain to the pleasure denial or come with testicle weight attachments and other additions.In terms of cost, chastity devices range from $20 to hundreds of dollars, and those truly invested in being chaste purchase custom-fitted toys. Toys shaped to fit genitals exactly improve fit and decrease likelihood of discomfort. Remember the FDA does not regulate sex toys, so research companies and different materials extensively before buying.If you really want to lock your honey down on Valentine’s Day, introduce the topic of chastity devices outside the bedroom, where there is no pressure to engage in or think about it immediately.

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2015/10/29/beasts-of-no-nation-exemplifies-horrors-of-war-torn-regions/,"Oct 29, 2015","Many young boys are familiar with playing the game of war. But in Netflix’s original movie “Beasts of No Nation,” war is no game — it is reality.Director Cary Fukunaga follows the brutally transformative journey of a young West African boy named Agu, played by Abraham Attah in his premier role, unveiling the hardships of life as a child soldier. Agu is forced to perform horrific acts and accept them as a means of survival. But he is only one example out of thousands of children who suffer through the evils of war today.Along with Golden Globe winner Idris Elba (“Avengers: Age of Ultron”), who portrays a ruthless commander of the Native Defense Forces, the war drama leaves nothing behind as it documents the monstrosities of a war-ridden area.The movie begins seemingly normal, even mundane. Though it’s set in a poor, rural village somewhere in West Africa, life seems to parallel that in the U.S.; young boys joke around the neighborhood and get into trouble, the older brother has a crush on a girl and is trying to sleep with her, and parents try to keep their kids well fed, educated and mannered.While they try to live as normally as they can, they all know that war is slowly creeping toward them. Living half in the present and half in the future, they all enjoy life as much as they can, but remain ready to flee when they need to.Unfortunately, their plan does not go accordingly when Agu becomes separated from his mother and loses his brother, father and grandfather to an ambush. Alone in the jungle, the NDF eventually finds and initiates him as a child soldier.Throughout the movie, there is an interesting contrast between the setting and actions. The background of lush, green jungles of Africa filled with an array of colors and creatures provides beauty. But the actions that take place in stunning scenery are ugly: murder, rape, looting and other atrocities.Despite the difficulty of the subject at hand, Fukunaga did not shy away from hiding any of the horrors. Though Agu is trapped in a hopeless situation, this conflicts with the fact he still commits atrocious crimes. At times, it was difficult to determine which was worse —  the acts themselves, or that a child was committing them.While it’s often said that war turns boys into men, the cold, cruel life of a child soldier only robbed Agu of a proper childhood. When he finally managed to escape the NDF, he found sanctuary in a United Nations rehab center for traumatized child soldiers. Even though he was not yet able to speak about his experiences, it is implied in the ending scenes that he will have a slow, steady and quiet road to recovery.In choosing to end the movie with Agu refusing to elaborate on his life as a child soldier, Fukunaga illuminates the silence that society has when it comes to the issue of child war soldiers.In an era where over 300,000 children are forced to be soldiers, films like “Beasts of No Nation” exemplify the excruciating psychological, emotional and physical horrors in areas of conflict.

You’re 18 or almost 18 years old. You can smoke, you can serve in the military, you can vote, and while it might not always feel like it, you’re well on your way to adulthood. And, that means making decisions for yourself.You’re going to be living without your parents, likely for the first time in your life. That newfound freedom comes with many choices, including the choice to drink. And, while I’m not going to sit here and tell you how to live your life, there are things I don’t think I understood as an incoming freshmen that I want to share with you. A phrase commonly associated with the University of Wisconsin is “party school.” Before I came to college, I thought this label simply referred to students’ frequent consumption of alcohol. And, while this is basically true, I didn’t understand that it stems from a culture that fetishizes excess.  You’re entering a culture where people brag about going to detox, where a high tolerance for alcohol is worn as some sort of badge and where the consistent excess consumption of alcohol is one of the most revered traditions at the school.6 super fun alternatives to drinking on a night out
Recently, the University of Wisconsin has become one of the top party schools in the nation. We here at The Badger Read…This culture is pervasive at UW, not only normalizing but celebrating behavior that is inextricably linked to campus rape, alcohol poisoning, long term health consequences and other problems. The issue isn’t just the drinking, it’s the pushing of a narrative that overconsumption is admirable, more fun and integral to the ‘college experience.’Somewhere along the way, heavy drinking became recognized as the best and, in some cases, only way to have a good time on the weekend. As a campus, it’s what we choose to celebrate, indoctrinating newly arrived freshmen with the view that drinking, for the sake of drinking, is fun.In the first few months of school, it’s easy to feel as if the only way to connect with your peers is with alcohol. The choice to drink is frequently made based on social pressure, not personal preference or a desire to have a beer or two. Choosing to drink is a perfectly acceptable choice, if it’s indeed your choice. But it’s important to remember that you don’t need to drink to make friends.UW-Madison has so much more to offer than heavy drinking. In addition to a world class education, it boasts a stunning campus, engaged students and a wide array of recreational opportunities. Unfortunately, a large portion of the student body frequently forgets these amazing privileges, focusing instead on an activity with serious downsides. It’s frustrating that people actively propagate an image of a consistently drunk campus, with few options for alternative recreation.The pros and cons of being the country’s top party school

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2014/11/03/tv-is-quickly-becoming-a-home-for-well-round-female-characters/,"Nov 3, 2014","The film industry is not exactly known for representing a diverse group of people. The Academy Awards are an embarrassing representation of that. In the 84 years of the Oscars, only one woman of color has ever won for Best Actress and only one woman has been awarded Best Director. Strong, complicated and multidimensional roles are rarely written for women (unless their name happens to be Meryl Streep).Though full-length films still struggle to offer worthy, expanding roles for female actresses, television has been able to break down these barriers in recent years. This encompasses all genres, from comedy to drama. Robin Wright completely stole the screen from a scarily-talented Kevin Spacey with her icy portrayal of Claire Underwood in “House of Cards.” She spoke on issues like rape and abortion. Though she is a maleficent, twisted character, she is everything but somebody placed on the back burner. In comedy, Amy Poehler’s lovable overachiever Leslie Knope has won the hearts of fans everywhere on “Parks and Recreation.”This isn’t just about women expanding the characters and roles they play. As everyone has noted with ShondaLand’s monopoly of Thursday night, women of color are finally seeing screen time. “Scandal” practically won back TV from the claws of Netflix with the dramatic tale of Olivia Pope’s affair with the president. But Olivia Pope is more than a ridiculously beautiful African-American woman. She is smart and independent, representing a new kind of woman on TV (although I am personally so tired of the president). She is complicated, with strength and emotion, allowing for the audience to empathize with her and respect her.Similarly, “The Mindy Project” writer, producer and actress Mindy Kaling has written a ridiculously-endearing character who jokes about her body size and portrays an overly girly grown-up woman.In an interview with Glamour Magazine when “The Mindy Project” first started, Kaling said, “It used to be that you had to make female TV characters perfect so no one would be offended by your ‘portrayal’ of women. Even when I started out on ‘The Office’ eight years ago, we could write our male characters funny and flawed, but not the women. And now, thankfully, it’s completely different.”Perhaps no conversation of women in television would be complete without the cult favorite “Orange is the New Black.” Never have more women been represented — women of all races, all ages and from all walks of life. “Orange is the New Black” is such a fantastic show for women for a plethora of reasons, but mostly because it’s honest. The show never writes one character as the moral guide. The show gives each character, from the ever-irritating Piper Chapman to the mentally unstable “Crazy Eyes,” a chance to tell their story. It is a show about women that isn’t focused on their love lives. It addresses real societal issues, like our prison system, but grounds those themes in goofy moments and deeply-rooted relationships.Television still has a long way to go in terms of diversity. It would be amazing to see a continuation of the groundbreaking work that women like Shonda Rhimes, Mindy Kaling and Lena Dunham (of “Girls”) have done, with shows that encompass meaningful characters of all backgrounds, races, sizes, etc. But it’s really the film industry that has to catch up. If more films were written with roles that gave complicated and honest depictions of women, perhaps sexism in this country wouldn’t be as pervasive.",TV is quickly becoming a home for well-rounded female characters,UWM

Jim Doyle, Butler enraged his opposition and planted the seeds for his downfall by contributing to a series of bold, progressive lawsuits. Butler himself later traced his defeat to three cases.The first overturned an appellate court decision ruling the operators of a crane at Miller Park that collapsed and killed three workers weren’t on the hook for $94 million worth of punitive damages because they didn’t act with malice or intent to harm. Butler, along with four other justices, found the interpretation too narrow and lowered the threshold for awarding damages.They were here: The life and legacy of Vel Phillips, first Black woman to graduate from UW law school

After Matthew Ferdon was injured during birth as a result of a doctor’s negligence, Ferdon sued for damages. A jury awarded Ferdon $700,000, but a judge subsequently reduced it to $410,322 to comply with the state’s damages caps. Butler contributed to a ruling that struck down the cap for pain and suffering.The third, Thomas v. Mallett, would draw fierce opposition from Wisconsin’s business lobbies. Paint companies were “aware of the dangers of a lead pigment used in paint as far back as 1904 but continued marketing their products through the 1970s,” the Associated Press reported.When a boy ingested lead paint chips that left him with mental disabilities but couldn’t prove which company made the paint, Butler and three other judges ruled the boy could sue several local lead paint manufacturers.Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce called this last ruling a “disaster” and feared it would set a “dangerous precedent” where all lead paint manufacturers were responsible for the harms caused by lead paint.

While unspeakably brutal, this triple murder was not particularly uncommon for the time period. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, more than 4,000 African Americans were lynched between 1877 and 1950. However, this instance stands out due to its location: Duluth, Minnesota.The mob which killed McGhie, Jackson, and Clayton numbered between 1,000 and 10,000, and was motivated by the erroneous rumor that a young white woman had been raped. While three members of the mob would be sentenced for rioting, they served less than 15 months in prison. Nobody was ever convicted of murder.While the murders were decried across the North, many in the area actually welcomed the news. The police chief in Superior, Wisconsin — just across the river from Duluth — applauded the action, calling for the city to “run all idle negroes out of Superior.” Some of the chief’s hopes for an ethnic cleansing of his city came true, with several African Americans being forced to leave.Ignorance, racism must be tackled by UW students, faculty through complete eradication of ignorance

It has stunning views of Lake Superior, good restaurants and a growing number of breweries.

It’s not a place people associate with barbaric, racially motivated violence.While the majority of lynchings took place in the South, viewing it and by extension subjugation based on race as an exclusively Southern problem harms our understanding of present-day America. Because our area of the country avoided most of the worst violence associated with enforcing a racial caste system, it’s all too easy to assume that, surely, a state such as Wisconsin is doing a better job of dismantling racism than, say, Mississippi. However, Wisconsin’s continuing school achievement gap

It’s impossible to ignore his lyrical genius, but it’s also difficult to appreciate that genius when it is wrapped in deeply violent and misogynistic themes.But his latest album, I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside, Sweatshirt has moved toward a much more mature, if conflicted and confused, personality. Sweatshirt produced all but one track on the album, and it shows — you can practically feel the contact high through the headphones.Compared to his first album, Earl, this release is a more deliberate, contemplative work. The beats are slow, often sliding in and out of time. As a whole, the album sounds almost like it’s melting together. This is especially evident in “Grief,” with its lurching time and trippy music video.At the heart of I Don’t Like Shit are themes of loss, inner turmoil and coming-of-age. Sweatshirt uses the same quick tongue and clever lyrics that we’ve come to expect from him, but he tackles more serious issues, and in a more mature manner — by my tally, there wasn’t a single rape joke or homophobic slur on the album.Sweatshirt grapples with the concept of mortality — his and others’ — throughout the record, often with the help of drugs. In the albums’ opening track “Huey,” Sweatshirt raps, “I spent the day drinking and missing my grandmother; in “Grief” he laments, “Thinking ’bout my grandmama, find a bottle \ Imma wallow when I lie in that;” and in his fantastic verse on “DNA,” collaborator Nakel Smith discusses his brother’s death: “I ain’t seen us in years \ And this news right here almost made me have a heart attack.”Grief is not limited to death, but also life’s daily tribulations. For instance, the breakup with his girlfriend appears throughout the album. On “Mantra” he raps, “And I hate when you home \ And when I’m gone I don’t call cause you nag.” The entire second verse is a none-too-kind reflection on the relationship.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC6dUsXVIFwWe also hear Sweatshirt grappling with coming of age as a celebrity. He discusses his issues with dealing with a large, adoring fanbase when he’d rather be left alone.“Now you surrounded with a gaggle of a hundred fucking thousand kids \ Who you can’t get mad at when they want a pound and a pic \ Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick \ And they the reason that the paper in your trousers thick,” Sweatshirt raps on “Mantra.”It’s clear that Sweatshirt is still struggling to discover himself. But it’s equally clear that he’s learned to be honest with himself. The music is full of self-reflection, both figuratively and literally, with the concept of mirrors shows up numerous times.Kendrick Lamar’s latest is divisive tour de force
In the words of “Holy Name of Mary Choral Family” in 1986 (recently popularized by Kanye West’s “On Sight”’ from 2013’s Read…This striking honesty and self-reflection is detailed through raw discussion of drug use; rather than glorifying it or bragging about it, Sweatshirt talks about how he uses drugs — mostly alcohol, pot and Xanax — as a coping mechanism. On “Inside” he raps, “Face-drinking smoker, it help me duck when emotion jab.”Notably absent from the album is fellow Odd Future — an LA-based hip-hop collective — member and founder Tyler, the Creator. In fact, Vince Staples is the only Odd Future member with a verse on the album, though Left Brain produced “Off Top.” This could be a sign of Sweatshirt coming into his own, or it could signal a deeper rift. The first verse of “Mantra” could be read as Sweatshirt’s frustration with Tyler. While the album is well-done, it almost doesn’t feel like an Sweatshirt album without appearances from Tyler and friends.The main issue with I Don’t Like Shit is its length; it consists of 10 tracks that average right around three minutes each. Of course, the upside of this is that every song feels like it belongs — there aren’t any filler tracks. Each and every song seems well thought out and crucial to the album as a whole.More than anything, I Don’t Like Shit is a deeply honest work. We still don’t know exactly who Sweatshirt is — neither does he — but each track gives us a glimpse into the life an artist, as troubled as he is talented, trying to come to terms with his identity.","Earl Sweatshirt doesn’t like shit, but you could like his new album",UWM

The new EDM culture entering into the mainstream means seeing the lights, getting crazy at the drops and maybe popping a molly — oh, and getting stupid drunk.These aren’t new traditions or ideas, though — every generation has had its group of rebellious kids who go to concerts to get wild, whether they’re hippies, grunge heads or flappers. But the big difference here is the lack of a social movement.EDM has drawn the most parallels from the disco age of the 1970s. The music is cheap to produce, it’s superficial and people largely go to shows solely on the hopes of “turning up.” The current backlash against EDM is reminiscent of criticisms that culminated at a 1977 White Sox game. At the game, those who abhorred disco filled a crate with disco records and blew them up on the field between games.Similar to disco, not all people in this scene are necessarily poor musicians, though they may be labeled as such. The genre’s musicians, such as Zedd and Skrillex, are known to play live instruments during performances, but even strict DJ sets take hundreds of hours of production.Despite this, most EDM artists fail to prove their musicality, let alone even put in much effort. EDM artists often incorporate parts from other songs and spin in a bass drop, which is fundamentally basic. The heavy synths and loud bass of the drops blend together and after a while, who can really tell the difference? At least artists like Steve Aoki embrace the nonsense and just run around stage, only spinning when necessary.Musicianship aside, the whole experience can be overwhelming and the main concern here is safety, especially in the festival scene. It’s too easy to get carried away in the crowd and by the obscene amounts of alcohol or other drugs. Heavy movement in extreme heat combined with drug use can lead to serious dehydration, which caused two people to lose their lives at the 2013 Electric Zoo Festival.The intense amount of noise, bright lights and alcohol causes people to make rash decisions. It is the trend to dress in revealing clothes and that, in addition to the overwhelming sensations, is a recipe for unwanted sexual contact. The crowded spaces make it easy for people to grind on strangers, which is never a smart idea. There is a defined problem with rape at music festivals and the “no consequences” mentality that EDM inspires is only making things worse.EDM certainly could be worse, but the superficial culture it embodies creates excuses for people to make poor decisions. EDM produces some good feels augmented while under the influence, but during other times, without drugs influencing your mind, its lack of substance is the only thing amplified.","EDM’s sobriety issue: Low on musicianship, high on drugs",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2016/04/18/state-hits-300000-mark-in-number-of-concealed-carry-permits/,"Apr 18, 2016","As of March, Wisconsin has issued 300,000 total concealed carry permits, but the state impact of right-to-carry laws is still widely debated.While this makes up less than 8 percent of Wisconsin’s adult population, concealed carry laws remain controversial. Those in favor argue concealed carry falls under one’s right to defend themselves, while those against say violent crime increases when concealed carry is allowed.Sixty-three percent of Wisconsin residents support concealed carry and 31 percent are opposed, according to the January 2016 Marquette Law School poll.Behind the numbers: Experts analyze recent statewide poll results
In the months following his short bid for the presidency, Gov. Scott Walker’s statewide approval rating has dropped as Wisconsinites’ support Read…University of Wisconsin journalism and mass communication professor Michael Wagner said concealed carry impacts almost every Wisconsinite. He said 8 percent is a large enough percentage to enter into almost every social situation.“If you’re in a room of 30 people, somewhere between two or three are probably armed,” Wagner said. “That’s just something that might give people pause when they’re out in the community.” Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, said she believes the number of permits that have been issued is significant and “alarming.” The Department of Justice had to add eight new positions just to process the new permit requests, Taylor said.Chancellor Rebecca Blank: Concealed carry proposal ‘defies common sense’
University of Wisconsin Chancellor Rebecca Blank says she would not send her daughter to a college that allows concealed weapons Read…But Jeff Nass, Wisconsin Firearm Owners, Ranges, Clubs and Educators executive director, said he thinks the 300,000 permits is a great milestone and would like to see those numbers increase in the future.“We’re extremely happy that we broke 300,000,” Nass said. “I foresee that number is actually going up as people start to realize that this is their right.”The people who have concealed carry weapons help protect those who do not have weapons to defend themselves, Nass said. By using conceal carry, Nass said he is protecting his wife and family.Taylor, however, said research shows most of the time, victims of crimes do not get the chance to use guns to defend themselves. She said it’s more often the case that guns get turned against them.Taylor said she is concerned about the new concealed carry permits being issued because recent research from Stanford University demonstrates that right-to-carry laws are connected with an increase in aggregated assault, rape, robbery and murder.“I’m not a fan of concealed carry at all because of this epidemic,” Taylor said. “I wish this law was never passed.”Democrats propose bill to ban guns everywhere on college campuses
Reps. Chris Taylor, Melissa Sargent and Terese Berceau, all Democrats from Madison, announced a bill Wednesday to ban all guns on college Read…Additionally, Taylor said Milwaukee law enforcement leaders have tied Wisconsin’s concealed carry law to a decade high of homicides seen in Milwaukee in 2015.But Wagner said there are too many different variables to definitively make this conclusion. He said it is unclear whether or not gun violence is linked to concealed carry because it’s hard to separate violent crimes from other influencing factors, like the state of the economy.“There’s not … terrific evidence on one side or the other that concealed weapons reduce or increase crime,” Wagner said.Past studies have indicated that concealed carry has no effect on crime rates, according to PolitiFact.Wagner said the strongest evidence indicates gun accidents are more common in places where concealed carry is legal.Nass, however, said gun accidents would decrease if children were properly educated about gun safety. He said he hopes schools will implement firearm safety to teach children about guns.Locked away: Bills would require new gun storage practices
A package of four bills looks to keep guns out of the hands of children, but critics say the proposals Read…Wisconsin residents are also skeptical of making guns easy to have in places where there are children present, like schools and campuses, Wagner said. For a proposal that would have allowed guns to be concealed carried on school grounds, 65 percent of Wisconsin residents opposed and 31 percent were in favor, according to the Marquette law poll.Lawmakers release bill to allow concealed weapons on UW campuses
Two legislators proposed a bill Monday that would allow concealed firearms to be carried inside buildings on public college campuses.

Here in the Midwest, Wisconsin’s neighbors, Illinois and Michigan have as well, leading Wisconsin’s residents to flock to Illinois and Michigan to buy marijuana.Colorado, the first state to legalize marijuana in 2015, earned almost $267 million in tax revenue in 2018 solely through the sales of marijuana — which was then re-invested into the state through investments in K-12 education, infrastructure and the state’s general funds.Colorado is not the only state to see vast tax revenues from the legalization of marijuana, as Washington and California had tax revenue exceeding $300 million, Oregon with nearly $100 million and Nevada with nearly $70 million. The raw economic incentive is clear. There is a large demand for marijuana, and states who choose to legalize marijuana and supply it through dispensaries are able to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue alone. Colorado has invested millions in education, Oregon has given $12.75 million to its states police officers and California has pledged to give $198 million to programs that prevent youth drug abuse, protect the environment and help law enforcement.Not only are the states able to supply a demand, employ hundreds of thousands and reduce the amount of marijuana-related arrests, they are also able to fund their schools, fix their roads and invest in projects benefiting the greater public good. Marijuana legalization inevitable but will bring new economic, social challenges
For a country which regularly puts people behind bars, restricts voting rights and denies housing to people because of marijuana Read…Here in Wisconsin, various marijuana legalization proposals have appeared in the Republican-controlled legislature only to be rejected.“We need to take into consideration the states that have already legalized marijuana and look at the impact it has had … this is a very complicated issue,” State Rep. Jesse James (R-Altoona) told WEAU13 News.James is not the only elected official to voice concerns.“I also want to be the spokesperson that educates people to at least take a moment and try to understand the impact, but let’s look at the future and the devastation that is going to come — because it will,” State Sen. Kathy Bernier (R-Wisconsin) told WEAU13 News. According to James,  the impact in other states must be examined, while Bernier believes full-fledged legalization will cause devastation.So here is an examination.One study has shown Colorado and Washington, two of the first states to legalize marijuana, have seen that marijuana legalization and sales have had minimal to no effect on major crimes. And, according to the same study, results from Colorado and Washington suggest that legalization has not had major detrimental effects on public safety. In fact, crime rates have actually decreased.The study states that, “combining county-level difference-in-differences and spatial regression discontinuity designs, we find that the policy caused a significant reduction in rapes and property crimes on the Washington side of the border in 2013 to 2014 relative to the Oregon side and relative to the pre-legalization years of 2010 to 2012.”  Legalization of marijuana will promote racial progress in criminal justice system
Wisconsin, the isolated island locked between three states that have legalized marijuana in one form or another, might not be Read…Not only did the states studied have decreases in violent crimes, arrests and binge drinking, but recreational legalization of marijuana actually led to fewer adolescents using marijuana. According to another study researching the effects of use of marijuana in adolescents, “[medical marijuana legalization] enactment was associated with small significant reductions of 1.1 percentage points in current marijuana use, with larger significant declines for male, Black, and Hispanic (2.7–3.9 percentage points) adolescents.” For James and Bernier, marijuana represents doom, devastation and disaster. Yet according to research, marijuana represents opportunity, reduction in violent crimes and increased revenue. It is imperative that Wisconsin legalizes the recreational use of marijuana within the next five to 10 years. Wisconsin’s public schools sit in a state of disarray as Republican funding cuts have led to increased class sizes and poorer results.Marijuana legalization in nearby states creates potential repercussions for Wisconsin
With Illinois’ recent legalization of recreational marijuana on Jan. 1 and the Chicago Tribune reporting nearly $3.2 million in sales Read…Moreover, according to a national transportation research nonprofit, 55% of Wisconsin’s major locally and state-maintained roads have pavement that is in poor condition and 19% in mediocre condition. The report blames inadequate state and local funding for worsening conditions, and estimates that drivers in some Wisconsin cities spend nearly $1,000 a year on repairs due to driving their vehicles on deteriorating roads.The state’s infrastructure is crumbling, public school students are struggling and sick Wisconsinites are unable to reap the benefits of legalized marijuana. Colorado, Nevada, Michigan, Illinois and the other states that have legalized marijuana have been able to improve their roads, public schools and health of their citizens — why can’t Wisconsin? There is empirical evidence that legalizing marijuana has the potential to lower arrest rates, decrease youth smoking rates and allow the state to reap many benefits. For the party of family values, Wisconsin Republicans seem content to allow public schooling to go under-funded, violent arrest rates to soar and families to suffer as they refuse to allow arguments for recreational marijuana legislation to be heard.

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2015/02/11/hump-day-spice-up-valentines-day-with-domination-submission-this-year/,"Feb 11, 2015","’Tis the season for roses, heart-shaped boxes full of chocolate, sappy gifts and … bondage. Due to the upcoming release of the film “Fifty Shades of Grey,” BDSM has found an unusually bright spotlight. BDSM is an acronym for Bondage/Discipline, Dominance/Submission and Sadism/Masochism. Every activity under BDSM is consensual; without this crucial part, such behaviors become abusive.Bondage involves tying, binding or restraining a partner. Discipline includes any element of punishment involved in a BDSM “scene” (a previously agreed-upon amount of time dedicated to “play”). Dominance and submission describe the power relationship among partners. All participants derive pleasure from dominating or being dominated. Control or loss of control is a key ingredient for many people who enjoy BDSM. Dominant and submissive roles may also be called “tops” and “bottoms.” A “switch” enjoys both roles. Inflicting pain turns on sadists, while masochists find experiencing pain pleasurable. These roles may overlap or combine to form a particular experience of BDSM.Hump Day on the elusive, infrequent nature of female orgasms
Welcome to the week before finals, when stress and caffeine levels are running higher than ever all over campus. Nothing Read…Most of us know “Fifty Shades of Grey” began as “Twilight” fan fiction, but this is hardly the worst of it. Both the book and film depict BDSM as an abusive relationship without equal agency of both partners. Using the Center for Disease Control’s standards of emotional abuse and sexual violence, social scientists found that nearly every interaction between Anastasia and Christian was abusive. When Anastasia gets drunk, Christian takes advantage of her, undressing her in his hotel room without consent — even though she asked him to take her home. Anastasia consistently blames herself for anything that goes wrong between them and relies on Christian to validate her attractiveness and self-worth.The book contains rampant slut-shaming, most starkly depicted in E.L. James’ sexualization of Anastasia’s virginity. And the kink introduced by Christian is definitely varsity-level stuff; just like anything in the bedroom, it needs to be worked up to, and Anastasia’s lack of experience makes her an easy target. Christian stalks and manipulates her, initiates lots of sexual activity without her consent (we call that rape), ignores her safe word and advances the myth that kinky people are survivors of abuse.In order for BDSM to be pleasurable and safe for everyone, it is essential to discuss and consent to each and every activity — an element neglected almost entirely by Christian (except when he introduces a contract, which Anastasia never signs). Although “Fifty Shades of Grey” can be used to inspire and arouse, it should not be used as a manual for BDSM. While there is nothing inherently harmful about BDSM, romanticizing and sexualizing aggression is dangerous.Hump Day explores misunderstood L word… libido
I am very curious about libido. I think I may have the craziest libido of all time, I think about Read…Why does it hurt so good?Playing with power roles and pain might seem like an irrational choice, especially if it’s with someone we love. Being tied up or involved in dom/sub play can induce an altered state of consciousness. Many submissive partners report feelings of freedom, presence and reduced anxiety. Dominants, on the other hand, describe feelings of deep concentration and focus. Enjoying pain can lead to an adrenaline rush, creating a feeling similar to a “runner’s high.” People who play both roles claim to feel closer to their partners after partaking in BDSM.Plus, our bodies are built for experiencing pleasure and pain together. The same chemicals and areas of the brain that control pleasure control pain, too. This explains why being spanked, flogged or paddled can be erotic and enjoyable for some people. People who are experiencing pleasure also have a higher tolerance for pain— especially women. So if a person is really turned on and their partner spanks them, it might sting less. Some people are turned on by the sound of spanking or flogging in addition to the feeling. Red marks, hickeys, bruises and ropes also hold some aesthetic appeal for many kinky folks. The power roles involved in domination and submission can be just a thrilling game of cops and robbers — with your pants off.Hump Day: How to toss salads like a pro
What was once a rude gesture of denial — “kiss my ass” — has recently gained increasing prevalence as a Read…ConsentConsent is the most important part of BDSM. Without it, a perfectly healthy dom/sub relationship is abuse. BDSM is not for everyone. Those who practice BDSM often refer to the acronym R.A.C.K.: Risk-Aware Consensual Kink. Thus, all parties should be aware of the precise risks involved and consent to them accordingly. Here are the tools you need to practice BDSM sanely and consensually:AftercareAftercare is the important (and often overlooked) process of taking care of one another after engaging in a potentially exhausting BDSM scene. Some people may want to rest, be left alone or process the experience in their own way. Common aftercare rituals include hugging, kissing, cuddling, complimenting, affirming an emotional bond, stroking hair or any other number of activities (sexual or otherwise). Aftercare is not just for the submissive partner; doms like to be snuggled afterward, too! Make sure to be receptive to what your partner needs and express your own needs.Sexual preference is a wonderland meant for people to explore and safely experiment with. Nothing about enjoying BDSM indicates a psychological problem or history of abuse, so never feel shamed or dirty for enjoying something that others do not. So maybe this Valentine’s Day, take your sweetheart to Home Depot and pick out a nice rope for a consensual night of BDSM.","Hump Day: spice up Valentine’s Day with domination, submission this year",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2012/10/03/periphery-creates-po/,"Oct 3, 2012","It’s a little early to discuss candidates for album of the year as it is only October, but I am going to go ahead and throw progressive metal band Periphery’s sophomore effort, the hilariously named Periphery II: This Time It’s Personal, in for consideration. Seeing as the album came out in July, a review may be a bit late, but with an album as dense, long and brilliant as this is, proper listening and analysis takes time. In a word, Periphery II is fulfilling; in two, it is nearly flawless. In 800, it is…well, you are already 97 in, so you might as well keep reading.Periphery is a seven-piece band from Bethesda, Md. that has been mentioned several times in the infallible “Paper Radio” by yours truly, and for good reason: they are a fantastic band that always strives for progression without sacrificing their roots. Periphery is one of the founding bands of the “djent” subgenre, and unlike the bandwagon bands that have jumped onto their (and other early djent band’s) coattails, they keep writing quality music that never seems to get stale. The band was originally the progeny of one Misha Mansoor, the lead guitarist and main songwriter. As noted in the previous DIY recording article, Mansoor recorded the entirety of their first album (and much of this sequel) in his bedroom studio, and had been recording song clips with programmed drums for years before the debut’s release in 2010. The release was met with almost universal critical acclaim thanks to Misha’s blending of songwriting influenced by Meshuggah and Nobuo Uematsu (of “Final Fantasy” fame), and a mix of accessible melodies and abrasive, challenging aggression.Fast forward to 2012, and the band’s second aural endeavor was hyped up to an insane degree by the metal community, an anticipation that was only exacerbated by the addition of two of the budding djent community’s finest musicians to Periphery’s already ample stable: Nolly Getgood of Red Seas Fire and Mark Holcomb, formerly of Haunted Shores (a collaboration with Misha). Furthermore, Periphery enlisted the talents of axe-slingers Guthrie Govan (of The Aristocrats) on “Have a Blast,” John Petrucci (of Dream Theater) on “Erised,” and Wes Hauch (of The Faceless) on “Mile Zero.” Thankfully, all of this great talent is not wasted on mediocre music; it completely lives up to the fans’ ridiculous expectations. And while it initially seems to come up just shy of the excellence of its predecessor, this album begs for listen after listen as a textbook “grower.”The record begins with “Muramasa,” the first track of a trilogy of songs (the other two being middle track “Ragnarok” and album closer “Masamune”) that together make up the cornerstone of the album. These three tracks are definite highlights, and being a trilogy, contain a single lyrical theme, similar chord progressions and note selections, and a cohesive overall feel. They also are a great introduction to the new twist to Periphery’s sound, one that may not please true metal fans.The aspect of Periphery II that makes it so great is its accessibility. “Accessibility” is sometimes considered a dirty word in metal, but it need not always be a synonym for “mainstream.” This album is a great example of accessibility in challenging music. Singer Spencer Sotelo’s vocal melodies are incredibly infectious throughout (see the aforementioned trilogy, progressive pop song “Scarlet,” painfully personal “Mile Zero” and the melodically contagious track that is, “The Gods Must Be Crazy!”). Unfortunately, Sotelo’s vocal melodies are not wholly original. He wears his influences on his sleeve, although when one channels the incomparable Rody Walker of Canadian prog metal gods Protest the Hero, channeling isn’t such a bad thing. The catchiness pervades into the guitars as well, making for an almost saccharine-sweet package. Still, catchy or not, the music is incredibly technical throughout. At no point does Periphery sacrifice technicality for the sake of melody, an important distinction to make from more pop-oriented artists. “Ji” is a guitar clinic from beginning to end (on a floor-rattling eight-string, no less), complete with what is my first exposure to a self-described “rhythm guitar solo,” in which all three guitarists (Misha, Holcomb, and Jake Bowen) and bassist Getgood get a chance to shine. Guitar acrobatics are also a focus of possibly the heaviest song on the album, the humorously named “Froggin’ Bullfish.” Even this vicious song is sure to get stuck in many a listener’s head through its masterful use of Periphery’s (and the djent genre’s) trademark polyrhythmic groove. This rhythm is present throughout the album thanks to perhaps Periphery’s most impressive member, drummer Matt Halpern.Halpern’s drumming is best described as controllably chaotic. Many YouTube videos make him appear as though he is having a seizure all over the drum kit, but those in the know realize this man just feels rhythm so deeply he cannot help but show it all over his being. There is no single moment where the drumming shines most because it is, simply put, perfect. Halpern’s beats are catchy, danceable, and ludicrously technical for the entire 69-minute runtime. Really, the last piece of the puzzle then is lyrical content, which Sotelo handles quite successfully for his first penning.Periphery’s tracks touch on a variety of atypical metal topics; there are no gory mass murders, rapes, or demon conjuring here. The only demons are personal ones dealing with the loss of a friend (“Mile Zero”), the struggle with faith (or lack thereof in “The Gods Must Be Crazy!”), and a lack of faith in humans’ will to think for themselves (“Facepalm Mute”). All these topics are discussed in creative and memorable language and imagery.Truly, Periphery’s seamless melding of catchiness, Meshuggah-esque groove, Final Fantasy inspired melodies and transitions, and punishingly heavy sections have created perhaps the best progressive metal album of 2012. In fact, they make a convincing case for “album of the year” in any genre. All music fans could find something to enjoy here, including a techno track (“Epoch”) to accompany the band’s sometimes industrial leanings. Sure, it isn’t perfect, but perfection is few and far between. At this rate, maybe the third time will be the five-star charm for Periphery.Regen McCracken is a junior intending to major in English.

I absolutely love sweaters. I love curling up under blankets. I love the changing color of leaves. I love pumpkin things (although I won’t spend $5 to have some faux-pumpkin syrup squirted in a cup of perfectly good coffee).The month of October also gives me an excuse to get really excited about horror movies. Every year during the weeks leading up to Halloween, I binge on horror films. Not only are they fun (and terrifying) to watch, but they also give an excuse — especially on cold autumn nights — to curl up with a partner and hold each other tightly during the really scary parts. Netflix is currently a treasure trove for spooky stuff, so here are 10 titles you should watch on the site before Halloween.One of the greatest Halloween-related movies of all time, “Donnie Darko” stars Jake Gyllenhaal (“Nightcrawler”) at the titular character, who suffers chronic hallucinations and is told by a large rabbit named Frank that the world will end in 28 days. Everything about the film is iconic, from the Tears for Fears-heavy soundtrack to the absolutely terrifying bunny costume to lines like “You’re such a fuck-ass” and “chut up.”Low-budget, sure. But also claustrophobic, unrelenting, gruesome and sprinkled with just the right amount of social commentary. This film wrote the book on zombie movies.It was this movie that popularized the found-footage genre, spawning endless imitators that could never match the brooding atmosphere of this 90s horror classic. You never see any “witch,” but the creaky sounds that seem to engulf the main characters’ tent are scarier than anything you could see.Brian De Palma’s “Carrie” is a masterwork of horror cinema, heavily indebted to Alfred Hitchcock and his techniques of building unbearable suspense. It tells the story of a high school girl (Sissy Spacek, “The Help”) who is bullied by her classmates and abused by her God-fearing mother. But she also has the power of telekinesis, the perfect ingredient for revenge (maybe in a school dance setting) against those who have wronged you. Just take a look at the film’s original tagline: “If you’ve got a taste for terror … take Carrie to the prom.”You’ll never want to have a kid after seeing this one, a classic from director Roman Polanski. Basically, Mia Farrow’s (“Dark Horse”) husband joins a satanic cult, then rapes her and impregnates her with Satan. Yeah, it’s as unsettling as it sounds.Probably one of David Fincher’s finest works, “Zodiac” tells the story of the famed serial killer who murdered numerous victims in San Fransisco in late 1960s and early 1970s. The killer taunted police with codes and riddles, but his identity forever remains unknown. The film adaptation of this peculiar case is a slow-burner, exploring the psyches of men driven by obsession while also offering a healthy dose of shocks and scares.A group of people hole up in a cabin while spirits haunt them over a claustrophobic 84 minutes. Sam Raimi’s sequel is slapstick horror at it’s finest; you will never have more fun being scared.“Twin Peaks” is returning to television for nine episodes in 2016, and all of them will be directed by auteur David Lynch. The original 30 episode series, which deftly combines mystery, horror and soap opera tropes, is a bizarre look at a perfectly normal-looking town with deep, dark secrets below its surface. It is endlessly unnerving, and the demonic presence of “BOB” is enough to give any viewer nightmares.A recommendation for film buffs only. F.W. Murnau’s 1922 silent classic “Nosferatu” is a crowning achievement of German Expressionism. It’s also a film that became the blueprint for all subsequent vampire films. The use of shadows, grotesque makeup and cross-cutting all make “Nosferatu” a delightfully creepy cinematic experience.I haven’t seen this but I’ve heard it’s terrible and disgusting.",10 scary movies/TV shows to watch on Netflix before Halloween,UWM

The MC from Harlem has confronted issues regarding class struggle, religion, government and institutional racism.So Immortal Technique focused most of his Barrymore set Monday night on the death of 19-year-old Tony Robinson, who died in an officer-involved shooting last weekend. Immortal Technique created an emotionally intense, politically-charged atmosphere inside the auditorium, which felt particularly searing for the community recently touched by tragedy.Immortal Technique opened the show with incredibly strong political messages that touched the crowd and created a massive hole for Talib Kweli to fill in the second half of the night.“Only slaves are afraid to ask questions,” Technique’s words echoed through the Barrymore Monday night, only four days after the shooting by a Madison police officer. He encouraged everyone to use the power of their voices. You should speak up, even if certain people come after you for the knowledge you spread and the ignorance you preach against, he said.Because of Immortal Technique’s prolific career as an activist, it was no surprise that he participated in the march Monday, met with members of Tony’s family and ultimately applied Tony’s story to the bigger picture of race in the United States.Not only did Immortal Technique and Kweli discuss institutional racism throughout the show, they also touched on subjects encompassing environmental degradation, same-sex marriage, abortion, conflicts in the Middle East and what Alicia Keys would probably label as “a woman’s worth.”Technique said our society needs to acknowledge that the way we currently live will never allow us to create and maintain “a sustainable system,” referencing our abuse of natural resources across the world. Later he talked about certain people coming up to him after shows, making statements like, “I don’t believe in abortion,” to which his response is, “Well I have a simple solution to that: don’t have an abortion!”Finally, after they performed what is probably their most famous song, “Dance with the Devil,” they brought up issues concerning how men treat the women in their lives. The song is about a young man with no father and a drug-addicted mother, who was so infatuated with the illusion of wealth and power that he severely beat and raped a woman to impress real men on the block, only to find out that it was his own mother and committed suicide.Technique clarified that the most important thing is not to “fight the battles you know you can win,” but rather the ones that “need fighting.” He encouraged men to step up in the face of injustice, and he applauded women for their bravery and strength.Technique also gave a brief description of hip-hop.

After six hours of heated debate, the University of Wisconsin Associated Students of Madison voted 13-12-1 to postpone a resolution demanding the Read…“I would never work against a marginalized group. I know oppression,” Goséy said.The legislation passed focused on immigrant rights, Palestinian rights, the pipeline through native lands and anti-black racism. Goséy said it was mainly the work of people of color and activist groups who were working to bring attention to these issues and divest from corporations who did not support them.Although the Palestinian and Israel legislation did not immediately pass, Goséy said members of Badgers for Israel were present at the April 12 meeting.“I was told there was a consensus from representatives on both sides, calling for an ethics committee. That was going to change our bylaws,” Goséy said.ASM unanimously approves contentious divestment proposal to mixed reactions from campus
After five hours of debate and nearly 50 people appearing before open forum, the University of Wisconsin Associated Students of Read…Goséy explained the resolution for this legislation happened to fall on Passover. She said she was “mischaracterized” and it was made to believe she and other ASM members attempted to ignore the Jewish holiday, and therefore excluding Jewish members from the process of voting on it.Goséy said this is inaccurate as the legislation had to be voted on twice. She felt it was a “miscommunication” and was made out to make her seem like she was discrediting a marginalized group.Former Rep. Ariela Rivkin, however, had emailed Goséy asking her to not introduce any legislation concerning “human rights mechanisms or transparency on investment policy” at the normally scheduled April 12 meeting.Rivkin explained to Goséy the meeting would conflict with the Jewish holiday of Passover, preventing any observant Jewish members of ASM from attending the meeting and discussing an issue “of importance to members of the Jewish community.”“As chair, I didn’t break any rules. When someone writes a piece of legislation to me, I put it on the agenda,” Goséy said. “Someone could have brought something outrageously racist to me, and as chair, it is in the ASM bylaws that I put it on the agenda.”After the resolution was passed, the student judiciary, which is predominately made up of white males, nullified their efforts. Goséy said by having the student judiciary being willing to suppress issues that matter to students of color, it is a “step back.”Student Judiciary voids approval of bylaw change for creation of financial transparency, ethics subcommittee

It makes it a very uncertain and resentful environment for people of color, that they don’t really know who their peers are and what they stand for,” Goséy said.Additionally, the ASM meetings discussed white supremacy and its negative aspects. This caused a lot of outrage among students at UW, which prompted the Brandeis Center’s initial letter to Blank.Goséy was heard saying “all white people are racist.” She responded, believing she has the freedom of speech to critique the advantages of white students and the consequences of white supremacy.“It seems as if white people are more concerned with being called racist than racism,” Goséy said.",Palestine Legal calls on UW to recognize ‘harassment and discrimination’ against former ASM chair,UWM

https://badgerherald.com/features/2020/02/18/pushing-the-needle-young-student-candidates-bring-progressive-new-ideas-to-local-politics/,"Feb 18, 2020","Elena Haasl’s apartment is crammed with students, talking over bowls of Oreos and posing for photos. It’s a typical college gathering — only the students are talking political strategy and there are “Elena Haasl for District 5” signs everywhere. This is a launch party.At 20 years old, Haasl is a University of Wisconsin sophomore, double majoring in community and environmental sociology and political science, along with a certificate in gender and women’s studies. She is also a candidate for the District 5 County Board.While this may be Haasl’s launch party, she is not the only student candidate present — next to her stands Jacob Taylor, a junior at UW and candidate for the District 16 Rock County Board. Max Prestigiacomo, a UW freshman and the uncontested District 8 Alder candidate, is hurrying Nada Elmikashfi, a UW super-senior and candidate for the District 26 State Senate, to the door — they’re running late to their Sustainable Madison Committee meeting. These four student candidates vary in age, experience, background and major, but are nonetheless all seeking to be elected. Their interests all align in being deeply passionate about bettering their community through civic engagement. The Power of Lived Experience Haasl, discussing her bid for the District 5 County Board seat, said it is important that a student fill the chair because it’s the only district made up of mostly students. She said that as a student, she knows the issues her constituents face because she has class with them, rides the bus with them and even lives with them.“I know the issues because I am active in it all the time,” Haasl said. “People talk about the issues that are important to them when I’m sitting in class. I come home to constituents of District 5 that are my roommates. Having that kind of unique experience also allows you to speak honestly on situations, and it also opens up conversations and potential policy platforms.”Haasl also has direct experience with many of Madison’s most pressing issues and how they often coalesce. She said that as a biracial, queer woman, intersectionality is something she has to think about everyday. This kind of direct experience with the issues is part of what makes younger candidates so impactful, according to Elmikashfi. Elmikashfi immigrated to Madison’s West side from Sudan at the age of six. As a low income black family in what is now the most segregated state in the country — according to a Wallethub ranking — her family had to move around a lot. She was not aware this was a systemic problem until she found a word for her experience — gentrification.This lived experience of being displaced helped Elmikashfi realize affordable housing has to be a priority. She said many addressable issues have only gotten worse under the current leadership, and she added that part of this inaction comes from a lack of lived experience.“If you look at bills for years, how many of these little changes have we missed?” Elmikashfi said. “That’s why I think someone with lived experience needs to be in the Capitol, and not someone … who hasn’t connected with the working class for a very long time. Maybe that’s shady, but it’s the truth.”This lived experience is also what makes addressing climate change so important to young voters, according to Prestigiacomo. He said young people have a vested interest in the environment because it directly impacts their future.Prestigiacomo said his experience as a climate activist has taught him the importance of engaging with young people in a meaningful way. He said after attending the United Nations Climate Summit, he thought a lot of these government-organized events boiled down to just photo-ops.Prestigiacomo said at the Climate Summit, youth were excluded from certain rooms and nothing got done. His experience showed him the importance of coalition building and letting young people lead the discussions.“Young people are the ones with the ideas that can take us from point A to point B,” Prestigiacomo said. “City government is pretty pessimistic a lot of the time … But, the young people in the room, being very vocal, being very loud about the injustices and what’s going to be the future will help remind them of that urgency.”And as all the candidates would agree — one way to include the youth is to have them in office. Active EngagementYouth civic engagement is on the rise across the country with UW’s student voter turnout jumping from 35.6% in 2014 to 52.9% in 2018. National voter turnout among 18 to 29 year olds followed the local upward trend, going from 20% in 2014 to 36% in 2018.Despite this increase, young people remain largely uninvolved in local government. District 8, which encompasses UW’s campus, has the lowest voter count out of all 20 districts, according to Wisconsin Elections Commission. This is despite having the fifth largest population, according to a report from the City of Madison Planning Commission.This participation in local government is key, as it allows constituents to be more engaged with their elected officials, according to Haasl.“I think it kind of sets the mark for new ideas and new conversations to really take off from,” Haasl said. “I love how centric to the community local politics is.”Taylor said in his hometown of Beloit, local government can be difficult to engage with. Taylor’s opponent, current District 16 Rock County Board Supervisor Phil Owens, was actually appointed to the board in 2015 because no one else ran, Taylor said. Taylor added that in Rock County, this is fairly common. In Rock County, 11 out of the 29 board members were appointed, not elected. Taylor said throughout the course of his campaign, he has knocked a few hundred doors and has yet to meet someone who knows who Owens is. Taylor attributed this to Owens lack of contest — he’s never had to form a specific platform because he has yet to compete with someone for his role. The only way for constituents to know how Owens votes is to attend the county board meetings, read the minutes or listen to them online, Taylor said.Even if constituents do follow the decisions of the board, there are few opportunities for direct participation, as Rock County has not utilized many referendums. In Fall 2018, Rock County did in fact put a marijuana advisory referendum on the ballot. But, when the majority of residents said they supported legalization, nothing was ever done with the information, nor have steps been taken towards legalization, Taylor said.Community members not feeling heard by local officials is not unique to Rock County. Elmikashfi said when she spoke with the elders in Madison’s Sudanese community, she found that none of them could remember meeting a single senator. Elmikashfi said it is important for elected officials to actively engage with all constituents in an accessible way. The incumbent District 26 State Senator Fred Risser, was first elected in 1962, making him the longest serving state legislator in the United States. Elmikashfi noted that Risser has not updated his Twitter since last spring.“If that is one of the ways that you’re supposed to connect with your constituency and you’re not doing that, how else are you gonna do that?” Elmikashfi said. “I think people should understand [the state senate seat is] not [only] a career, it’s literally the livelihood of Madison.”Prestigiacomo said one way to empower a larger proportion of the community is to lower the voting age, and he would push for it as an important step in re-enfranchising young people. He said it should be lowered, if not for city elections, then for school board elections, because candidates should be accountable to the people they hope to represent.In the meantime, Prestigiacomo is working with current District 8 alder and UW grad student Sally Roher on establishing a campus neighborhood association. Elmikashfi said providing these platforms for all members of the Madison community is essential to making good policies.“It’s the people’s platform … people that are actually affected by these are the people that are writing these,” Elmikashfi said. “The constituency has the solution. It’s not me, I’m just a vessel for that in the Capitol.”Governmental GatekeepingEngaging with constituents as a candidate may be key to creating equitable platforms, but getting these platforms into the Capitol may be difficult due to the state government’s many gatekeeping mechanisms, according to Elmikashfi. Some of this gatekeeping is centered around identity, Elmikashfi said. A representative Elmikashfi had looked up to said she thought Elmikashfi would face a lot of pushback during her campaign because she is a young woman of color. She then urged Elmikashfi not to run.Elmikashfi said this diluted her entire candidacy, disregarding her qualifications and platform and implying she wouldn’t be as productive in the Senate because she is young and black.“That just reminded me that my blackness, I’m not running in spite of it,” Elmikashfi said. “My skin color has given me challenges that I’ve learned to work very creatively around. And I think that’s not something that’s going to hinder me but inform the way I legislate.”Haasl said she has had similar experiences. She said people have tried to erase parts of her identity, likely because she is not running on identity alone. Working around the Capitol’s gatekeeping has brought these young candidates together, as they are running without an institutional network backing them, Elmikashfi said. Elmikashfi is managing Haasl’s campaign and all four have attended each other’s campaign events.Elmikashfi said what they are doing is unprecedented and because they are running grassroots campaigns without institutional support, they are forming their own. Through collaboration and learning from one another they have formed their own coalition of sorts, one that has a shared vision for UW students, Elmikashfi said. Being less entrenched in traditional governmental institutions is an advantage to Prestigiacomo, who said politics is inherently inaccessible to a lot of people because it is so rooted in complicated theory. Prestigiacomo joked that, while he will “be the only alder with acne,” he thinks he will bring a fresh new perspective to the council“It’s important for the young district alder to keep your eye on the prize, and keep that uncompromised opinion of what the future looks like and what young people want, which is more progressive policies at the city level,” Prestigiacomo said. Taylor said he believes his young age is an advantage because a lot of people want a younger demographic to go after these opportunities.The data, too, suggests there might seem to be a push for more youth in elected office. A recent poll conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and MTV found that 79% of Americans ages 15 to 34 thought leaders from their generation would do a better job running the country.Ensuring this support for young candidates goes beyond just a photo-op can be difficult, as Elmikashfi said elected officials often call her an “inspiration,” whilst telling her she is not experienced enough to run.Haasl said a lot of this support for young candidates stops once they begin campaigning.“People always want young people to run for office, and say that they’ll support them until it’s actually time for them to run for office,” Haasl said.Shocking the SystemDespite the barriers, these candidates are determined to make real change. All four of them cited frustrations with current government when explaining how they got into politics.Haasl said racism should not still be an ongoing issue at UW in 2020, and college should be a place everyone feels welcome. She expressed frustration at the idea that diversity being positive isn’t something innate to campus culture yet.Prestigiacomo echoed this frustration with the pace of change in Madison. After a year of unsuccessfully trying to work with the council on climate action, he said, he decided to become an alder himself.Elmikashfi said some of this inaction is due to pessimism within the Capitol, saying the parties clash heavily and view the other as inherently negative. But she said Wisconsin has passed a lot of important bipartisan bills in the past, and that representatives need to have the intention and willingness to go after change.With Wisconsin becoming steadily more segregated, Elmikashfi said this inaction cannot continue. “If someone had had the intention years ago, to not get us where we are now, we wouldn’t be, four more years of leadership, or advocacy that doesn’t come from someone that knows what it feels like to be marginalized, you’re going to miss being able to change the system,” Elmikashfi said. “Four more generations of our children will grow up in socio-economic disenfranchisement.”These candidates are ready to end this inaction and engage with constituents in modern ways. Elmikashfi said she frequently lays out her platform to Uber drivers. Prestigiacomo said he will go to where students are — their phones, using digital platforms to communicate with his constituents. Taylor said he wants to start live streaming County Board meetings so more people can know what’s going on.While each candidate may have different innovative approaches to spreading their platform, they all want to reach more people. With the primary on Feb. 18, the general election on April 7 and the state senate primary on Aug. 11, campaigning efforts have ramped up.Regardless of the election results, the students say they will continue to push for progressive change. Elmikashfi said it is time for someone extreme, someone who will ask for a lot and, even if they don’t get all of it, will push the needle a little further in the right direction.“I think that repeating the same methods over and over that clearly haven’t worked is insanity,” Elmikashfi said. “So you need someone to shock the system a little bit, to show them that your constituency is very diverse … and you have to be held accountable for that.”KATIE HARDIE/The Badger Herald ",Pushing the Needle: Young student candidates bring progressive new ideas to local politics,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2015/03/05/outreach-in-madison-offers-help-to-lgbt-homeless-population/,"Mar 5, 2015","In the midst of same-sex marriage legalization and the fight for Madison’s homeless, a LGBT homeless community finds itself in a unique struggle to find shelter each night.Homeless services in Madison are not even enough for all the homeless people in Madison who are not LGBT, said Steve Starkey, executive director of the OutReach Community Center.Each year, Madison conducts a point-in-time study to determine the number of homeless people who receive services from the city. On average, about 800 people are involved in the study, Starkey said.The study gathers age, race and a variety of other demographic information. Last year, the study began to ask participants their sexuality, Starkey said.Last year, 10 percent of participants, or about 125 people, identified as LGBT, Starkey said. However, there could be more who were just not comfortable disclosing their sexuality, even though the study was anonymous, he said.Many transgender people living in Madison earn a lower income, which means housing is harder for them to find, said Angie Rehling, assistant director of OutReach. While transgender people are legally protected from discrimination, she said employers and tenants can find ways to get around those laws and discriminate against protected classes, making it harder for them to maintain a job earning enough money to find housing.In Madison, the unemployment rate for transgender people is double the average unemployment rate for the general population, Starkey said. It is also a lot higher than the rate for gay and lesbian people, he said.Ginger Baier, a transgender woman on OutReach’s board, transitioned later in life after retirement, so she did not go through the struggles most transgender people face in the job market. However, she does work with young transgender women as a mentor and knows the issues they face.Courtesy of OutReachFifty-five percent of transgender people in the survey have reported being physically or verbally harassed at a shelter by either a staff member or another resident, Baier said. Forty-seven percent left their shelter due to poor treatment, and 42 percent were forced to stay in a facility designated for the gender they did not identify with, she said.Forty-two percent of transgender homeless people staying in a shelter reported being sexually assaulted by staff or other residents, Baier said.Gay and lesbian residents are able to fare better at shelters than transgender residents, Starkey said.“Often, gay or lesbian people can pass for straight people and sex orientation isn’t as obvious,” Starkey said. “Gay and lesbian residents are able to function in those facilities and not be noticed, but transgender residents are a lot more obvious with their clothing, the way they wear their hair and accessories.”It is even harder for gender-queer homeless people, who do not identify with either gender, to find the right shelter, Rehling said. If they do not fit in, it makes them not want to go to a shelter, which is an even bigger problem.Transgender residents will receive more harassment, which has led to them being attacked, Starkey said.The safety risk is in part due to minimal security at some shelters, Starkey said. There may only be one social worker from the shelter watching anywhere from dozens to a hundred residents.“If harassment does take place, it’s hard to stop or even know it’s going on,” Starkey said.Another reason transgender people are not allowed in shelters is privacy. As some women in shelters can feel uncomfortable with a male-to-female transgender woman sleeping in the same room as them, it can lead to violence and harassment, Starkey said.There is also the issue of bathrooms and showers. The showers in shelters are very open and unsecured, so if a transgender person has not had a sex reassignment surgery, being in a shower with other residents of the opposite biological gender can be uncomfortable and dangerous, Starkey said.When people first look at an individual who is transgender or gender nonconforming, they cannot tell the difference between gender and appearance, Rehling said. The stigma associated with transgender individuals and their appearance is based off fear, when in actuality they are just people who want to thrive and succeed, she said.OutReach, south central Wisconsin’s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Center, was founded in 1973 by its parent organization, the Madison Gay and Lesbian Resource Center, as a way to provide support for LGBT community members, Starkey said.“Our mission is to promote equality and quality of life for LGBT people,” Starkey said.OutReach is run with two full-time staff members and three part-time staff members, Rehling said. Throughout the year, OutReach has between 50 to 100 volunteers, she said.Outreach offers 25 social support groups to LGBT community members, ranging from movie or discussion groups to intense support groups, such as ones for people who have been abused, Rehling said.“It’s a place for people to come and be who they are,” Rehling said.During Baier’s transition, she started going to the Madison Area Transgender Association, a transgender support group.She now facilitates a transgender support group Saturday mornings in addition to serving on OutReach’s board and mentoring young transgender women.“I have mentored several transgender women, some of them successfully, some of them not successfully,” Baier said. “One of them could not stay clean and sober. But one of the first girls I mentored has moved out, has a job, has a place to live. She was on the street when I first met her, and is now off the street and working on going back to school. I consider that a success story for myself and for OutReach.”One of the ways OutReach is helping LGBT homeless people is through Willma’s Fund, Rehling said. Willma’s Fund was started by Donald Haar, whose alternate drag persona is Willma Flynn-Stone, she said.Willma’s Fund helps by paying an extra month of rent, a security deposit on an apartment, transportation fees or even a week in a hotel, Starkey said. The Salvation Army is also involved in the program, giving the LGBT homeless a second week in a hotel or double the transportation fees, he said.“[Willma’s Fund] raises money so that we can give small grants to people who are LGBT [and] homeless and in an emergency situation,” Starkey said.Courtesy of OutReachOutReach also offers a variety of services in their community center. Some of these include a lending library, social and support groups, events and fundraisers for smaller non-profit organizations, according to the OutReach website.OutReach is currently writing a grant to the city to create a host home project, a fostering situation for LGBT homeless adults who need some extra help, Starkey said.“OutReach has been a tremendous help for me,” Baier said. “I found a lot of support. I made a lot of friends there. It’s been a great experience.”              Courtesy of OutReach ",OutReach in Madison offers help to LGBT homeless population,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/opinion/2008/04/11/sexual-abuse-not-pro/,"Apr 11, 2008","For more than 200 years the Constitution of the United States of America has enshrined freedom of religion through the First Amendment, which states in part, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” Although this country has by no means been perfect in following this practice, most religious groups in the United States have been able to freely worship in whatever way they please.In the past week, events in Texas have rekindled the debate over what kinds of religious practices are legitimate and what practices violate the law, warranting state intervention. In the case at hand, Texas law enforcement officers raided a compound affiliated with the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. FLDS is a splinter group from the Mormon Church and adheres to the belief that men and women must engage in polygamy to reach the inner circle of heaven. In 2007, the sect had a high profile run-in with the law when Warren Jeffs, its leader, was arrested on charges of arranging a marriage between a 14-year-old girl and her 19-year-old cousin.In the most recent incident, Texas Child Protection Services received an anonymous call from a 16-year-old girl in the El Dorado compound alleging that she was a victim of physical abuse and that older sect members were marrying and impregnating girls under 16 (in violation of Texas law). Since the raid on April 4, law enforcement officials have removed more than 500 women and children from the compound to interview them and protect them while an extensive search of the area is conducted.Given the scale of the raid and the massive number of women and children involved, it is no surprise that a debate has broken out over whether or not the government should have intervened and over the status of polygyny in the U.S.The practice of polygyny is currently outlawed throughout the United States. By itself, polygyny does not seem to be a particular threatening practice. After all, if three or more consenting adults all wish to live together or be married in some combination, I don’t think it is really any of my business. In fact, I don’t even think it should necessarily be illegal.However, the practices of FLDS give me pause. First of all, their leader has been implicated in attempts to force underage girls to marry. With the current raid exposing a number of underage girls pregnant or already caring for children, it seems likely that the polygamists within FLDS have gone far beyond the practice of polygamy. Marrying and impregnating 14- and 15-year-old girls binds them to the religious movement and leaves them with no other choice but to remain with their base of support in FLDS, regardless of living conditions.For the most part, the government has left FLDS alone. In fact, law enforcement agencies in Texas said that up until the aforementioned phone call they received in March, they had no probable cause to intervene at the compound. The reluctance to confront the sect is understandable, as the memory of the 1993 Waco Siege, in which more than 70 people died during a standoff with a splinter group of the Seventh-Day Adventists, remains poignant.However, if the investigation into the El Dorado compound reveals widespread child abuse and the violation of state laws on marriage and sexual activity with minors, I think more action needs to be initiated.There are approximately 6,000 to 8,000 members in FLDS. The main location of the FLDS church is well-known, and the vast majority of the group lives in two towns: Colorado City, Ariz., and Hildale, Utah. Like the compound in Texas, the groups in Arizona and Utah have also been left alone for the most part.Now, though, these communities need to face greater scrutiny. The state or federal government should take the lead in ensuring the proper treatment of the children in these communities and ensure that state laws concerning the age of consent and marriage are kept, particularly since it appears older sect members are abusing their power and committing these heinous acts.The Associated Press estimates there are 40,000 polygamists living across the western United States. While many of these people may be in benign relationships, the facts coming out of the most recent raid shows that this is not a reality in Texas. Freedom of religious expression is not a license to flout reasonable state laws aimed at protecting minors. Either FLDS needs to shape up and show they will comply with state laws, or they need to be stopped before committing any more crimes.Andrew Wagner (awagner@badgerherald.com) is a junior majoring in computer science and political science.",Sexual abuse not protected by Constitution,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2015/09/01/hump-day-why-ghosting-haunts-relationships/,"Sep 1, 2015","The term “ghosting” — ending a relationship simply by cutting off all communication — was highly talked about this summer after Charlize Theron broke her engagement with Sean Penn by refusing to respond to his texts or calls.Despite my disgust for Penn and his abusive tendencies in relationships, the cruelty of ghosting as a practice in itself struck me. A shocking 11 percent of Americans have been ghosted, which has sparked debate on the breakup method ranging from supportive to horrified.Ghosting happens in platonic or romantic relationships between all sorts of people of different backgrounds, gender identities and sexual orientations. When ghosted, the incompleteness and lack of closure can be painful.Some people suggested Theron might have cut off communication to avoid abuse — this is not ghosting — ending relationships due to abuse doesn’t need an explanation. Survivors of emotional, physical and sexual abuse owe nothing to their attackers. If lack of communication is necessary to keep someone safe, then that choice should be respected.But, ghosting is defined by its apparent suddenness and lack of communication at the end of a relationship.  Sudden and absolute removal of contact mostly occurs as a result of avoidance and an intense fear of conflict. Facing another person’s pain — especially someone beloved — can be excruciating. Someone might ghost their partner due to deep insecurities about themselves or the relationship.Some will cite online dating apps and social media as ingredients to ghosting. Arguably, reliance on text-based communication may create the illusion that a relationship exists primarily within the screen. This illusion tricks a person into believing that lack of response to messages equates a breakup.But, social media often acts as an obstacle to ghosting. Even if a ghosting perpetrator deletes their partner or friend on Facebook, mutual acquaintances may still share said perpetrator’s content.Once enough time has passed to make it clear that all those calls and texts will never be returned, feelings of anger and hurt surpass the usual post-breakup depression. According to a study published in the Journal of Research in Personality, participants chose ghosting as the most painful breakup method — even worse than picking fights.Ghosting reinforces any anxiety regarding relationships or abandonment. Plus, avoidance sometimes leads to bigger confrontations later, as partners insist on an explanation for days or weeks without contact.After someone has been ghosted, dating expectations may lower dramatically. Commitment can seem impossible afterwards, but time and trusted loved ones are truly the best medicine for wounds of the heart.In order for a breakup to be clean and healthy, partners must communicate honestly and openly. Do not begin a relationship that you know won’t end respectfully, and make preferences clear early on. Serial ghosters may find their solution in a cognitive behavioral therapy tool called exposure.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2021/11/11/a-new-world-of-opportunity-how-one-city-schools-is-working-to-reform-education-in-madison/,"Nov 11, 2021","Close friends of Kaleem Caire describe his aspirations as “crazy.” His story explains why.Kaleem Caire grew up on the South side of Madison and graduated from Madison West High school. With a 1.58 GPA, Caire barely passed the mark.After Caire spent three years in the Navy, he was released early due to an injury and decided to take a leap to attend Hampton University in Virginia.He eventually graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a 4.0 and honors — a far cry from his academic standing when he walked across the Madison West stage after high school.During his time at UW, Caire changed his path from becoming a doctor to becoming an educator based on the mentorship he received from staff. It was also at UW that Caire noticed the paths his peers were going down, including abusing substances and dropping out of school.While Caire found his footing after high school and dedicated himself to his college classes, he realized some of his classmates could not do the same since they never made it to college.The education system had failed his peers long before when they were in high school.Since then, Caire has made it his life mission to reform Madison’s education system — as “crazy” as it may be.“The things that Kaleem is trying to do, at the scale he’s trying to do them … He’s not trying to make incremental improvements,” One City Schools Co-Founder Vivek Ramakrishnan said. “He really is trying to change fundamentally what is happening in Madison and Wisconsin. The lengths to which he will go to make that happen are crazy.”Together, Ramakrishnan and Caire’s mission to improve education in Madison is on its way to being realized through their passion project — One City Schools.One City Schools operates as a nonprofit, tax-exempt public preschool and grade school that is working to change the common approach to educational methods. As achievement gaps persist across all levels of education in Wisconsin, One City Schools attempts to traverse a challenging landscape and create an educational system that ensures success for youth in the community and beyond.Caire’s workCaire has carried a “pedal to the metal” attitude with him throughout his life. This attitude proved pertinent when he took an education research position with UW after graduation, when Caire discovered the extent to which students of color were dropping out and not attending school.At the time, it was believed that the high school dropout rates among Black and Latine students were around 16% to 17%. But after conducting further research and calculations, Caire said they learned that only about 50% of Black and Latine students were graduating from high school.Caire said the other researchers were shocked by the numbers. While the numbers didn’t surprise him, he said they reinforced just how much work needed to be done.Caire said it was difficult for him to see his friends and peers growing up and not using all of their capabilities. It was equally hard when he started to realize that the system wasn’t really built to help Black people succeed.Wisconsin has seen significant disparities between Black and white students for decades, including in the achievement gap, graduation rates and school suspensions.Caire knew he needed to do something.“I tell people that was a vision I’ve had since I was 17 years old, trying to figure out how to start a school,” Caire said. “I realized all the work I was doing with research and community programs and schools was all preparing me for that moment when I started One City.”Propelled to action following his research with UW, Caire went to talk to Howard Fuller in Milwaukee about the next steps to make his teenage vision a reality. Fuller is a professor of education who is known nationwide as a civil rights activist and education reform advocate. He specializes in work to ensure equitable education for Black children.With similar views and goals for the future of education, Caire believed that Fuller would be able to offer him advice.“Dr. Fuller had said to me, ‘You know Kaleem you’ve got two options,’” Caire remembered. “He said, ‘You can try to do this from the inside, or you can do it from the outside.’”While he spent time with Fuller, Caire observed the options for charter, public and private schools that used voucher programs in Milwaukee to tackle the problem from the inside. The first independent charter school that Caire proposed in Madison was shut down by residents. In 2014, he was approached by a group he was involved with at Child Development Inc. The center was soon going out of business and asked Caire if he would take over their school to help keep childcare in the community.Child Development Inc. knew of Caire’s goals to create a new school system in Madison, so the group gave Caire the opportunity to use their foundation to launch his own mission.In 2019, the UW System officially approved Caire’s vision of One City Schools as a public charter school. Now, as the founder and CEO of One City Schools in Madison, Caire is able to put his vision for education into practice on a large scale.“My career has been interesting, and it’s been intense and impactful, but I’m glad to be home and finally getting this opportunity to do One City,” Caire said.One City Schools’ missionRamakrishnan said Caire is particularly good at getting people behind his mission and doing whatever it takes to help it along the way — even if it means getting down and dirty.Ramakrishnan meant that quite literally. Before One City had the funds to hire a full-time custodian, Caire cleaned the school building after hours by himself for a year.Ramakrishnan said one reason Caire is such a respected leader is that he “does not ask anyone to do anything that he himself is not willing to do.”Originally, Caire focused primarily on reducing the achievement gap between students of color and white students in Madison. The achievement gap has been a longstanding problem in Wisconsin. In 2019, the year One City was approved by the UW System, Wisconsin had the largest achievement gap in the nation.But Caire has since expanded his mission to educate kids on a host of issues that will impact their lives in the future such as global warming, access to clean water and navigating the digital age.Caire said these life-changing topics are ones that other schools are not tackling in-depth. Though other schools are not discussing how these issues will need to be addressed in the future and how students’ lives will be impacted, Caire believes these are the topics students need to be learning about.“I’m going beyond focusing on the gap and now I’m trying to really use One City to create a new model of education in America,” Caire said. “I really want to support our children but also prepare them to tackle these big issues later.”For now, Caire and One City Schools are executing these goals through the organization’s two schools. The enrollment for the 2021-22 school year is at 162 students between the two institutions. One City’s preschool operates as an early childhood learning center, serving kids from two to four years old. Their elementary school serves kids from four-year-old preschool through fourth grade.The goal is to build the schools to serve an additional grade level each year, until middle and high school levels are also represented at One City.Tackling a broader issueOne group at UW that is working to address the gaps that Caire hopes to eradicate is Matriculate. In many ways connected to the achievement gap, another pertinent disparity that exists in education is the gap between students who are applying to college.To address this problem, Matriculate works to inform and give low-income, high achieving students the resources to apply to college. Matriculate’s advising fellows at UW pair up one-to-one with high school students to mentor and support them during the college application and selection process.Matriculate Head Advising Fellow Maggie Riordan said many of these programs aim to give students the resources, support and confidence they need to make the college decision that is best for them.“Matriculate’s idea is that the majority of high achieving, low-income high school students don’t apply to the same reach colleges or best-fit colleges that students of higher incomes apply to,” Riordan said. “Through mentorship and that one-on-one relationship they have with their advising fellow, we teach them how to build a college list and gain the confidence they need to apply.”Riordan said mentoring occurs on a student-by-student basis, as it allows individuals to connect with their advising fellows and receive support from a peer as they need it.These kinds of programs exist because of the educational and social divide between certain students and their peers, Riordan explained.“Matriculate is filling that gap that exists in resources that students have to apply to college and support they have. Because those resources don’t exist already, Matriculate and other nonprofits try to fill that gap,” Riordan said. “That gap shouldn’t exist in the first place.”The gap that exists between students in the college application process is a gap that Caire is also trying to systematically address from a young age through One City Schools.One City Vice President of External Relations Gail Wiseman said their young students have a solid foundation to succeed later in life because of the curriculum and philosophy of One City.“I do think preparation begins immediately,” Wiseman said. “I don’t think it waits until middle school or high school. I think the solid foundation they’re getting with critical thinking and problem solving already at the preschool level feeds into further curriculum.”Though One City Schools only function as a preschool and grade school today, Caire’s near-future plans involve expanding into a middle and high school.At the high school level, One City plans to partner with universities to create programs that allow students to take college courses as early as their freshman year of high school. Through completing this programming, students may only need to attend college for one year before receiving their degree.“We currently have a school developer looking at those [upper grade levels],” Wiseman said. “I don’t think we’re going to land on one program; I think we’re going to land on the best parts of different programs to create a hybrid of different programs. We want the programs that are going to help prepare the leaders for tomorrow.”Effects of a new designToya Pedracine-Stewart is a parent and board member at One City Schools. Pedracine-Stewart has been a One City parent for four years and currently has one child enrolled at the school.Pedracine-Stewart said the staff at One City are especially good at knowing students’ personalities and helping them shape their unique talents. With a staff that is diverse in race, culture and background, Pedracine-Stewart believes her daughter sees that she can be and do anything she wants.“One City gives [my daughter] the opportunity to see that in life, when people say you can be what you want to be when you get older … they bring that vision into reality,” Pedracine-Stewart said.Pedracine-Stewart appreciates that at One City, students are not only lectured in order to learn curriculum content. Students can be creative, complete hands-on projects and work with their peers in order to foster an environment of sharing ideas and opinions. Much of the curriculum that One City has adopted centers around working in groups to problem solve and complete projects.Wiseman said that because young children’s brains are developing at such a rapid pace, it is important to expose them to real world situations and ways to solve issues.“Access to these kinds of tools will make all the difference in the world,” Wiseman said. “Giving children a foundation as a way to handle their relationships and so many different parts of their lives can’t do anything but good. It seems like a wonderful approach to me, and that’s what they do all day long.”In the classroom, Wiseman said teachers actively seek opportunities to have their students problem-solve and work as a team.For example, Wiseman was in one of the kindergarten classrooms recently when one student didn’t want to share with another. Instead of simply telling the student to share, the teacher asked the students to reenact the situation in front of the class so the whole class could work together to solve the situation.Wiseman said no one made any of the students feel badly about their actions. Instead, the disagreement was simply a situation that the team needed to overcome.This ability to share ideas and opinions is especially important in a community like One City where the strong diversity brings in people from many different backgrounds.“Regardless of what our experiences or background has been, as parents and as people we are so much alike,” Pedracine-Stewart said. “One City, like the name, truly creates an opportunity to feel like it is our One City community.”Expanding the modelWiseman said One City’s hope is that other schools will adopt the same philosophy and programs that they have built.“There’s no inferior or superior kids,” Wiseman said. “Everyone is doing their best and everybody is there because they’re supposed to be there. That’s the philosophy, and I think it really helps the kids.”Ramakrishnan explained that generally non-profit organizations are thought of as being risk averse and predictable in the steps they take to grow. But this is not the way Caire has operated with the way he built One City Schools.“Some of the risks we take operationally and business-wise … some of the bars he sets are crazy aspirational-wise,” Ramakrishnan said. “The guy does not play it safe. Kaleem doesn’t lower his bar.”One City Schools currently has two projects underway that are big steps forward in Caire’s plan. With a building they’ve recently purchased, One City will add a 157,000-square-foot addition to its campus which will include more grade levels. The organization will also be building a new athletic facility on their existing property.Caire explained that these kinds of strides are only possible because the people of One City come together in community to support their children. Though there are many different backgrounds, cultures and beliefs at One City, everyone comes together for the betterment of the students.Caire hopes the climate he has built at One City translates into the greater Madison community. And with his aspirational tone and booming laugh, it is easy to see how Caire has built the community and made the progress he has at One City.“I tell people I’m a social architect in that I build solutions to solve these big systemic problems,” Caire said. “I want to create a new world of opportunity for our young people all around the world.”",‘A new world of opportunity’: How One City Schools is working to reform education in Madison,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/news/2019/09/04/human-trafficking-bill-working-way-through-wisconsin-legislative-body/,"Sep 4, 2019","Wisconsin Senate Bill 49, also known as Assembly Bill 41, is moving through Wisconsin’s legislative body and could be heading toward its now second executive session. The bill provides provisions for a safe harbor law for minors who are being human-trafficked into prostitution. Rep. Jill Billings, D-LaCrosse, the lead author for the Assembly version of the bill, said instead of arresting these victims, they would go into Child Protective Services.“They are brought in through human services instead of being put in jail in an orange jumpsuit and chains,” Billings said.Billings explained that sex-trafficking victims often come from troubled pasts, which could include sexual abuse, drug dependency or homelessness.When these already-troubled youths are arrested for prostitution, it adds further trauma as well as makes getting their lives back on track more difficult, Billings said.Billings also pointed out that human trafficking is a prominent issue in Wisconsin, which was brought to light by the FBI’s Operation Cross Country, an annual action where law enforcement aims to recover trafficking victims and spread awareness of the issue.Wisconsin State Legislature introduces bill protecting free speech on UW campuses
Two republican lawmakers in the Wisconsin state legislature introduced a bill to protect free speech on University of Wisconsin campuses Read…Results from a 2015 operation revealed that Milwaukee tied for third in the nation in terms of minors recovered from human trafficking situations. Milwaukee has even been dubbed the ‘Harvard of pimp schools’ by Dana World-Patterson, chair of the Human Trafficking Task Force of Greater Milwaukee. Though Milwaukee is a focal point for trafficking, the problem is statewide. Former Wisconsin Department of Children and Families Secretary Eloise Anderson and former Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel co-headed the first state-level Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force which operated from January 2015 through December 2017.At the end of the task force’s operation, the DCF released a report in December of 2018 revealing
 the reality of human trafficking in Wisconsin.In 15 months, there were 422 child sex trafficking allegations. Of these, about 40 percent occurred in Milwaukee county while almost 60 percent occurred in other countries. In the end, there were 99 substantiated allegations with 86 of them involving unique individuals. Nearly half of the substantiated claims originated in Milwaukee.Government efforts in this sect are often delegated to the DCF, which focuses primarily on combating the trafficking of minors and works closely with the Department of Justice, Department of Corrections, Department of Public Instruction, Office of State Court and local courts, Department of Health Services and community service providers.They work toward their goal through community educational outreach, such as their statewide prevention and awareness campaign called “WI, We Need to Talk,” as well as survivor support services.

They have seen more alleged perpetrators charged, because the alleged victims are more likely to cooperate.She said this is due to the fact that the trafficker makes their victim feel as though they have no other option, and that the trafficker is the only person that truly cares for them. “When they’re arrested by law enforcement, it reinforces the idea that they don’t have anybody here who can take care of my except for my trafficker,” Billings said. “But if they’re brought into law enforcement and get services, then they are more likely to see that they can get help from other people.”Billings added that she wanted people to know this bill would benefit vulnerable kids, with the average age of those assisted being between 12 and 14. She said the assistance the bill could provide would help young kids turn their lives around in order to continue in a healthy and successful way.She said she hopes Wisconsin would experience a similar success to Minnesota and that the bill continues to have the level of support it has seen up to this point.“We have to get this,” Billings said. “We have to get this bill done. This is the second session that its gone through. It’s time that Wisconsin takes the next step in the initiatives that we’ve done to help with anti-human trafficking, and really cast the spell of time for this bill.”",Human trafficking bill working way through Wisconsin legislative body,UWM

https://badgerherald.com/features/2019/10/15/americas-changing-dairyland-consumer-values-concerns-shape-modern-animal-agriculture/,"Oct 15, 2019","Over the summer, outrage bubbled across the internet and in grocery stores as videos from an animal rights group surfaced depicting abuses occurring on Fair Oaks Farms, the headquarters of Fairlife products.Metcalfe’s Market, the Madison-area based grocery store, pulled Fairlife dairy products from its shelves after videos of violent animal cruelty taking place on the brand’s main farm surfaced, according to Channel 3000. The videos posted by animal rights group Animal Recovery Mission showing uncomfortable living conditions, violence and dead animals, among other disturbing things.Metcalfe’s was one of a handful of grocery stores to pull the brand altogether in early June, Channel 3000 reported.As if animal cruelty claims weren’t bad enough, dairy farmers around the country have already been struggling as milk prices have stayed down for an unusual amount of time, an article by WisContext explained.But Peter Carstensen, a retired University of Wisconsin law professor and expert on dairy industry law and policy, believes this has more to do with the current unstable foreign trade relations.“What’s happened is that farmers have had an enormous amount of economic pressure that has been exacerbated in the last three years, by the trade wars, all the other things that enhance in the security in the market,” Carstensen said.In Wisconsin, America’s Dairyland, farmers especially are feeling the record-long low milk prices. The economic difficulties manifesting across the state’s titular industry have started to raise eyebrows, especially when studies came out this past year showing high suicide rates among dairy farmers.But the stir around the Fairlife video — and the fact that the video was made at all — is a testament to a trend in consumer values that is also negatively impacting the dairy industry today. The validity of the industry itself has been called into question, particularly relating to worries about environmental sustainability and animal welfare. Viral or valid? The viral video that exposed Fair Oaks Farms last June opens with a necessary warning about graphic and sensitive footage, and a drone shot of Fair Oaks Farms, the headquarters of the Fairlife brand in Fair Oaks, Indiana. Then, rapid-fire clips show calves being hit, thrown, jostled, pulled and kicked. As narration about the investigation and its findings plays, images of dead calves, violent abuse and animals in confined spaces continue.The video narration explains this was the most “consistent and constant abuse” the team has seen in its history of investigation: “Nothing is worse than Fair Oaks Farms.”Jennifer Van Os, an associate professor of dairy science at UW and a Wisconsin state extension specialist in animal welfare, saw the expose-style video and others like it, and shared her insight as to how trustworthy they can be.Though she declined to comment directly on the Fair Oaks video, Van Os spoke about expose-style animal rights videos generally.“One important thing to recognize is that most of the groups who use those kinds of tactics, if you go to their websites and look at their mission statements, they’re very explicit that their goal is to end animal agriculture,” Van Os said. “So they use these tactics to try to come up with video footage, that will … try to reduce the consumer base for animal products.”Van Os explained there are generally three types of practices shown in this type of footage in these videos.First, there is willful abuse. According to the Farmers Assuring Responsible Management website, “willful mistreatment” of animals includes “acts that maliciously cause pain, injury or suffering including … needlessly applying any type of prod … malicious hitting or beating of an animal … prolonged lack of access to feed and water, and inappropriate on-farm harvest or euthanasia.” Luckily, mistreatment is relatively uncommon, she said. When it does occur, though, Van Os said the behavior is usually prosecutable. She added that the abuse is typically at the hands of stock-people and is a result of a lack of training, whereas the farm owners or managers are usually unaware of the abuse. “It’s impossible to have a successful farming operation if you’re engaging in or condoning willful abuse,” Van Os said. “So that’s something that I would say is very uncommon and undesirable that everybody in the industry would agree.”Other common practices seen in video footage are those that are widely accepted in the field, but which can appear aesthetically unappealing to a viewer unfamiliar with farming. Without context, practices or conditions considered safe and healthy for the animals can look unpleasant, Van Os said.“These videos can use those poor optics to their advantage to try to elicit disgust in the viewer,” Van Os said.Finally, there is what Van Os called the “gray area,” where expose videos depict practices that some experts think are acceptable and some think are not. These types of clips are the most complicated, since best practices and scientific knowledge about animal welfare change over time and are not always one-size-fits-all.No matter the type or types of clips in a video, Van Os made it clear that videos should be viewed with the understanding that the organization’s goal is usually to eliminate animal agriculture. Whether that aligns with the viewer’s values or not, it is important to understand the context, she explained.Van Os also noted that these organizations are sometimes mislabeled as animal welfare groups when most are actually animal rights groups. The terms are not synonymous, though they share some common ground.“… What they have in common is that they think humans have an ethical obligation towards animals,” Van Os said. “But the difference is that people who believe in animal rights think that humans should not keep animals under their care … whereas people who work on animal welfare, such as myself, believe that it’s okay to use animals for certain human purposes. But when animals are under our care, we have a responsibility towards them.”Impactful consumer values Consumer values are a big concern for those in the dairy industry. But while these values vary from consumer to consumer, all have the ability to impact the market — hence the call at the end of the Fair Oaks video to boycott Fairlife products and animal agriculture altogether.And although videos of animal abuse have uneven effects on populations, that doesn’t mean there aren’t trends. Currently, consumers seem to be most concerned with animal welfare and sustainability.Though some concerns may not be rationalized through research, Carstensen said they should all still be taken into consideration.It is the reasons for these concerns, Van Os said, that need to be evaluated. “We can’t come up with solutions in a vacuum,” Van Os said. “Because even if we say, ‘Oh, this would be really good for the cows, and it would work really well for the producer,’ if the public won’t accept it, then we don’t have a consumer base, and it’s not sustainable.”Van Os said her work essentially revolves around finding a balance between ethical and practical concerns. She and her lab try to do proactive work to constantly maintain and improve animal welfare throughout Wisconsin’s dairy industry. Some of her current research focuses on mitigating pain in routine procedures, the benefits of raising calves in social groups, concerns around thermal stress and ventilation, and bilingual stock-person training. As a specialist in animal welfare, Van Os said she believes that an animal’s well-being can and should be understood through science, not just emotion.“ … By studying animal welfare, we can bring the animals’ voice to that conversation by trying to use objective methods to identify what they need to maximize welfare,” Van Os said. In working to address consumer concerns, Van Os said she believes progress can be made at the intersection of stakeholder and researcher perspectives.Van Os stressed the importance of doing not only biological research on the animals involved, but also social science research to understand what concerns the public and stakeholders have. Determining where voters, consumers, dairy producers, veterinarians and others participating in the industry share values and priorities is crucial, she said, and doing so allows for more productive conversations about animal welfare.“… It really comes down to … acknowledging that animals with certain neurological structures can perceive positive and negative emotions,” Van Os said. “Not necessarily complex human-like emotions, but that our actions can have consequences to how they feel, whether it’s how they’re housed, managed [or] directly handled by people.”At the university level UW is also working on other issues that modern dairy consumers are concerned with: environmental sustainability of the dairy industry, as well as that of other animal agriculture industries.According to studies done throughout the past decade, limiting dairy and red meat intake is key to slowing climate change. By doing so, the methane that animals — specifically cows — release into the atmosphere decreases, allowing for reduced depletion of the ozone layer.Researchers at UW, like professor of dairy science Victor Cabrera, are working to improve efficiency outlooks in order to combat the amounts of methane put into the environment. The basis for the research is simple: If fewer resources can be used to produce the same results, the system is more efficient. Cabrera’s work looks at ways to reduce the amount of feed farmers use while still producing adequate quantities of milk. He also studies how to genetically maximize cows to render larger quantities of milk, thus reducing the number of animals necessary to meet dairy consumption demands.“If we produce the same amount of milk, with less feed … it means that we are reducing the carbon footprint of the production system,” he explained.Cabrera sees his work as correlated with other positive outcomes. He said this increased efficiency in milk production will most likely increase economic productivity because fewer inputs are necessary for generating the same result.Cabrera also views his work as complementary to animal welfare.“And likely, [production efficiency] … will also improve better production systems, will improve welfare as well,” Cabrera said. “ … In my opinion, they are not opposite — the welfare [and] the profitability. You can be as much profitable and still be a very good steward of the welfare of the animals.” Faculty to farm Metcalfe’s ban on Fairlife products from its shelves lasted all of two days. On June 7 they announced they would continue stocking products from Fair Oaks Farms after owner and founder of Fair Oaks Farms Mike McCloskey made a video of his own, apologizing and taking responsibility for the abuse on the farm.“Watching this video broke my heart and created a sadness that I’ll have to endure the rest of my life,” McCloskey said in his own video. “I am sorry and I apologize for the footage in this video. So with a heavy heart and great disappointment that I feel in the breakdown of our systems, I would like to update you on how we’re approaching to correct all these actions.”McCloskey said three of the employees in one of the original videos had already been terminated prior to the video’s release after co-workers had reported them for mistreatment, and another worker had been terminated since the video’s release for actions depicted in the footage. McCloskey also laid out further plans to improve treatment outcomes of animals on the farm, including the installation of cameras wherever there are animals.Made clear by incidents like this, consumer concerns can have substantial impacts on animal agriculture markets. Sometimes, consumer concerns grow around one extreme event — like the Fair Oaks viral videos — while other times they are longstanding, such as environmental sustainability.But in any case, UW is there to address those concerns, parcel out their validity and try to mitigate the negative effects, and then pass that information on to where it matters — the farmer — to create best practices.“It’s really a pleasure to be here in Wisconsin where we have a lot of strong alumni relationships and strong ties to the industry because I see a lot of these really eager, progressive, proactive people in the industry who want to learn and want to improve and I find that super encouraging,” Van Os said. “So even though more people don’t grow up on the farm, I don’t expect them to learn everything about ag but just to know that there are a lot of people that are highly invested in making sure animals get the best care possible.”","America’s changing Dairyland: Consumer values, concerns shape modern animal agriculture",UWM

This trend is also concurrent with his “Misery” video in which he is basically hit and slapped around by some supermodel the entire time. She literally pushes him off of the roof of a building.

I really do not see how that part of the video plays into the rest of the plot, but I must say that I had to watch it more than once because the visual effects were intriguing.It is evident this video was orchestrated by directors and filmmakers that had more than just an iMovie level of editing training.

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2016/01/06/revisiting-the-best-movies-of-2015-in-time-for-awards-season/,"Jan 6, 2016","The holidays are over, you’ve binge-watched all of “Star Wars” and “Making A Murderer,” but there’s still nearly two weeks to kill before school starts. With awards season about to get underway, now is the perfect time to revisit 2015’s best movies.Featuring the always deliciously caustic Amy Schumer (“Inside Amy Schumer”) and a massively talented comedic cast, “Trainwreck” was far and away one of the best comedies of 2015. The story of a woman sleeping her way through life before ultimately settling down with “the right guy” isn’t the most original idea a screenwriter has had, but the harsh and unforgiving way in which Schumer and company modernize and liberate this tale brings a much-needed breath of fresh air to the romantic-comedy genre.HIPSTER-CAKES.tumblr.comThe number of spy movies that can be considered on the level of James Bond quality-wise is depressingly small. There is Jason Bourne … and not much else. Luckily, Matthew Vaughn’s adaptation of the little-known comic book “The Secret Service” brings along a delightfully violent addition to the ranks of good spy movies. Anchored by newcomer Taron Egerton (“Testament of Youth”) along with old hands Colin Firth (“Before I Go To Sleep”) and Samuel L. Jackson (“The Hateful Eight”), “Kingsman” carries itself with an air of light silliness, without descending into full-on parody.yahooentertainment.tumblr.comIt seems as though nobody can make a Steve Jobs biopic that is both good and successful at the box office. Ashton Kutcher tried, and ended up with an abject failure. Now, Michael Fassbender’s (“Macbeth”) latest attempt has been met with universal critical acclaim, but with fairly pitiful box office numbers. Ignoring its minimal receipts, “Steve Jobs” is a far better film than its predecessor.Following the titular character backstage at three major Apple events, it does not pull punches when it comes to emotional weight, and finally does the enigmatic figure of Steve Jobs justice.yahooentertainment.tumblr.comA nice follow-up to last year’s “Listen Up Philip,” Jason Schwartzman (“7 Chinese Brothers”) once again stars in a movie seemingly designed to make viewers uncomfortable. This wacky little indie flick by sophomore director Patrick Brice swings for the debauched fences and knocks it out of the park with a shockingly vulgar Adam Scott (“Krampus”) turning in a particularly excellent performance.“The Overnight” is not a long movie, but it really does not need to be. Any more would almost feel overcrowded and drag down the visceral impact of Brice’s beautifully vulgar indie.Once again, the supremely talented Denis Villeneuve has created an excellent movie poised to be completely shut out of awards season. “Sicario” follows FBI agent Kate Macer, played by an American-accented Emily Blunt (“Into the Woods”), as she descends deeper and deeper into the sick, twisted world of the infamous Ciudad Juarez. Blunt turns in an excellent performance, but it is Benicio del Toro’s (“The Little Prince”) portrayal of CIA agent Alejandro Gillick that steals the show.The moral grayness of “Sicario,” especially that of Gillick, is what really makes it more interesting than your average procedural fare.helenspreference.tumblr.comQuentin Tarantino, in an effort to stop dancing around the point, decided to finally make an actual Western instead of the neo-Western “Inglorious Bastards” and “Django Unchained.” Of course, being a Tarantino flick, “Hateful Eight” is also an Agatha Christie-style locked door mystery, as part of Tarantino’s ongoing effort to avoid conforming to any one genre. Perpetual cast member Samuel L. Jackson (“Chi-Raq”) plays a major role, especially in what will surely be the most well-remembered scene of the movie. Talking to an unapologetically racist former Southern general played spectacularly by Bruce Dern (“Cut Bank”), the undisguised malice Jackson summons is chilling.With excellent performances from the rest of the cast, including a nearly unrecognizable Jennifer Jason Leigh (“Anomalisa”), “The Hateful Eight” is an interesting new turn in Tarantino’s ever-bizarre filmography.The only movie that can justifiably be named “Oscar Bait” that ended up being better than mediocre, “Carol” is a resounding gut punch of a romantic drama. If Cate Blanchett (“Truth”) does not at least get seriously considered for Best Actress after this performance, there is no justice. It’s also nice to see a movie that follows a lesbian couple without fetishizing the concept, a depressingly common misstep in stories like these. Blanchett and Rooney Mara (“Trash”) both bring solid performances, as the movie does not give its characters an easy ride.That said, the film manages to end in a way that is soundly satisfying while also not underwriting the struggles characters underwent to get there. “Carol” will grab you tight and never let go, all without resorting to the typical same-sex love-story cliches.techcrunch.comAfter the spectacular disappointment that was the prequels, J.J. Abrams’ new creation is like a direct shot of adrenaline. It didn’t take itself too seriously, there wasn’t any boring political melodrama and the acting was quite spectacular. But beyond comparison to far lesser films, “The Force Awakens” stands alone as an excellent flick. The new characters, especially Rey, played by newcomer Daisy Ridley, click better than anyone could have hoped. A recommendation is in order, but is also somewhat pointless. Odds are most, if not everybody, has seen it already.disneypixar.tumblr.comPixar has been a little off since “Toy Story 3.” With uninspired releases like “Brave” and “Cars 2,” audiences might have started to think that maybe the studio long held as the pinnacle of animation was starting to slip. But “Inside Out” put all those thoughts to rest.Benefitting from a spectacular voice cast, this tale of an 11-year-old girl’s personified emotions really should make you cry, with one scene in particular being a guaranteed tearjerker. Those who have seen this animated masterpiece know the scene, those who do not may find themselves weeping uncontrollably in front of their friends. Animation and writing savant Pete Docter can be blamed for bringing audiences young and old alike to tears, and every other emotion as well over the course of this literal emotional rollercoaster.In a year without a breakout favorite for the major awards, “Spotlight” seems to be far and away the best of 2015. This is not a movie for the faint of heart; the story of the Boston Catholic Diocese covering up prolific, ongoing sexual abuse of children induces spectacular amounts of anger. This movie will cut deep, especially for those who were raised Catholic, but the real story of the movie is the investigative team that uncovered the massive scandal.“Spotlight” doesn’t idolize the role of journalists in modern society, but it also doesn’t shy away from their importance. Ultimately, the balance between an organization as powerful as the Boston Diocese and the journalists investigating its wrongdoings is what sets it apart from other films in 2015. Nothing else can compare.",Revisiting the best movies of 2015 in time for awards season,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/features/2019/09/17/9-17-print-feature/,"Sep 17, 2019","“Last Wednesday, he was doing 25 to 30 pull ups a day. And on Friday, there’s talk of him being intubated,” the father of an unnamed former Wisconsin high school athlete said to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. His son had recently been hospitalized in Florida.The man, admitted to the intensive care unit, told MJS that his doctors said his lungs looked like “a 70-year-olds” and that he felt like he “was going to die.” He was admitted with a fever, chills and symptoms that were originally diagnosed by a private doctor as pneumonia. As time passed, however, his family found out differently. Doctors at the hospital suggested that his illness was related to vaping with his electronic cigarette.In early August, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services confirmed 11 state cases of teenagers and young adults with severe lung disease. Patients were noted to have shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, cough and weight loss, with some needing assistance to breathe.The key takeaway, however, was sobering. Dr. Barbara Calkins, a pediatrician with Westbrook Pediatrics of the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, summarized the hospital’s initial warnings.“On July 25th, Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin warned the public of the potential danger of vaping for those who are underage after we reported eight cases of hospitalized teenagers with seriously damaged lungs to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services,” Calkins said. “Vaping was the only commonality among all of the patients.”Wisconsin smoking rates above national average, while vaping rates on the rise
While smoking rates have gone down amongst adults in the state of Wisconsin, vaping rates amongst teens have gone up, Read…Vaping, according to the Center for Disease Control, is the use of an e-cigarette. The vapor is produced by the device heating a liquid that usually contains nicotine, flavorings and other chemicals that help to make the aerosol. The vapor is then inhaled, both by users into their lungs, and by bystanders who can breathe it in when the user exhales into the air.Niru Achanta, a junior at the University of Wisconsin, said he vapes “almost daily.” He talked about how he first became interested in vaping in high school.“In high school, I thought the [vaporous] clouds were cool,” he said. “As time went on, I mainly used it for semi-stressful situations like [homework] and family parties.” According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 9.5% of students have tried an e-cigarette by the eighth grade. That number rises to 16.5% in the twelfth grade.Furthermore, the Food and Drug Administration states 1.5 million more middle and high school aged students used e-cigarettes in 2018 as compared to 2017. This correlated to a 78% increase in high school students’ use, and a 48% increase in middle school students’ use.According to a statement from Marlena Holden, Director of Marketing & Health Communications at University Health Services, the use of e-cigarettes has quadrupled among incoming UW students since 2016.Max, a sophomore at UW who requested to go by first name only, said he started vaping in college. He cited “party culture” as an introduction to vaping. “When you go to parties, a lot of people have [e-cigarettes] and they pass them around or offer them [to you], especially the first couple times when I said I had never tried it or that I didn’t have one,” he said. “Eventually, I was sort of like ‘well, it’s annoying to have to hit someone else’s’ because I started wanting it during the day … so I went and got one and hit it way more after that.”Doug Jorenby, Director of Clinical Services for UW Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention and a professor of medicine, cited a Badger Herald article where UW staff accessed statistics from AlcoholEDU and discovered that 20.9% of incoming students reported past usage of e-cigarettes. Jorenby said that the 20.9% rate couldn’t necessarily be extrapolated to define all undergraduate usage, but that he wouldn’t be surprised if it was around that benchmark. UW, American Lung Association professionals discuss measures reducing e-cigarette usage
In early August, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services reported 11 cases of serious lung impairments among teenagers and young Read…Max said he felt that many UW students, and people in general, thought that e-cigarettes were “healthier” than cigarettes. This, he said, makes them more inclined to try an e-cigarette when offered one as opposed to a cigarette.According to Jorenby, e-cigarettes, to some extent, can involve different risks than cigarettes.“E-cigarettes definitely don’t involve the same risks as cigarettes,” Jorenby said. “To put that into context, we look at what we’ve learned from the mid-1950s and onwards, where we’re looking at health effects of smoking globally … Generally, [a large percentage of] longtime cigarette users will face very serious health consequences that can and often do result in death. It’s very sobering when you think about that, and the legality of cigarettes. Compared to that, vaping is almost certainly lower risk.”According to the CDC, cigarette smoking causes about one of every five deaths in the United States each year. The web page also adds that, in longtime users, quitting smoking before the age of 40 reduces risk of dying from smoking-related diseases by approximately 90%.Jorenby added, however, that the negative effects of cigarettes do not eliminate the negative effects vaping can have.“This doesn’t mean that [e-cigarettes are] risk free. In terms of the science of things, we’re badly playing catchup — e-cigarettes came out of nowhere for the public health community,” Jorenby said. “We’ve already got some solid scientific data about specific risks to pulmonary health that are unique to vaping. It’s not on the magnitude of inhaling tobacco smoke, but those risks are there.”The Chicago Tribune reported on Adam Hergenreder, an 18-year-old from Gurnee, Illinois. He was hospitalized in a case similar to the Wisconsin athlete.Hergenreder told the Tribune he and his friends didn’t believe “how dangerous [vaping] is.” He continued to vape regularly, up to one and a half pods a day — and wound up in the hospital, where he was taken after days of vomiting.From his hospital bed, he told the Tribune that he was glad to be an example.“[Vaping products] aren’t good at all,” Hergenreder said. “They will mess up your lungs.”Smoke Signals: Wisconsin referendum reveals voters want legal weed, but what are the risks?
Wisconsin said yes to marijuana Nov. 6. Unlike what drug prevention programs have warned America’s youth against for years, this Read…Dr. Bill Kinsey, UW’s chief health officer and medical director of UHS, specified that the effects of vaping can be difficult to gauge.“[E-cigarettes] emit a vapor that contains harmful chemicals and the effects on the health of the user, and those around them, are largely unknown,” Kinsey said.Secondhand tobacco smoke has been well-known to cause harmful health effects to bystanders. According to the CDC, secondhand smoke causes over 7 thousand deaths annually from lung cancer and over 30 thousand deaths annually from heart disease.Darcie Warren, Coordinator of the Partnership for Tobacco Free Wisconsin with the American Lung Association, went into detail on e-cigarette long-term effects.“The inhalation of harmful chemicals found in e-cigarettes can cause irreversible lung damage and lung disease. Questions about long-term and lasting damage to patients will need to be studied,” Warren said. “We know the brain isn’t fully developed until around age 25, and the addictive nicotine found in flavored tobacco products and e-cigarettes slows brain development. Nicotine use can cause problems with attention, learning and memory.”Achanta said the debate surrounding cigarettes and e-cigarettes can be “complicated.”“On one end, vaping can help overcome nicotine addiction,” he said, adding that he did think vaping publicly was still “obnoxious.”Paying the price: How UW’s drinking culture impacts community as a whole
Many students at the University of Wisconsin wear the school’s high academic rankings as a badge of honor, especially since Read…The CDC lays out an abundance of suggestions for overcoming a vaping addiction. One page on their website states that e-cigarettes “have the potential to benefit adult smokers … if used as a complete substitute for regular cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products.” On a different page, the CDC states in all capital letters that “E-CIGARETTES ARE NOT CURRENTLY APPROVED BY THE FDA AS A QUIT SMOKING AID.” On the same page, it’s stated that evidence from two randomized, controlled trials “found that e-cigarettes with nicotine can help smokers stop smoking in the long term compared with placebo (non-nicotine) e-cigarettes.”That page adds that many people who choose to vape as a method of fighting addiction wind up not quitting, and instead use both methods.In addition to the CDC, Jorenby added that when people use e-cigarettes to stop smoking, many people will end up losing at both.“They’re vaping some of the time, and then they’re also smoking some of the time,” Jorenby said. “We don’t have a good handle on how dynamic that is. Do they in fact give up the smoking? Do they give up vaping?”Jorenby cited research he conducted with Megan Piper, an associate professor and a lead researcher at UW-CTRI. According to the work, a cohort of both smokers — defined as using at least five cigarettes per day for six months and no e-cigarette use in three months — and dual users — defined as having smoked daily for three months and using e-cigarettes at least once per week for the past three months — completed baseline assessments. These assessments included demographics, tobacco use and dependence. The participants also provided breath and urine samples.“We followed these people for two years,” Jorenby said. “We weren’t making suggestions on their behavior, they just did what they did and we collected that information. We met them once every few months in person, and called them in between that.”The study notes that when they recruited, they deliberately oversampled dual users. Details of the cohort population include that slightly more than half were men and 32.2% lived with a partner who smokes. The study also noted that there were “significant differences between exclusive smokers and dual users on race, education, and self-reported psychiatric history measures.” Overall, dual users were found to be more likely to be white, younger, have more than a high school education, report a psychiatric history and live with someone who used e-cigarettes.“We just finished our two year follow-up, but we’ve taken a deeper look into the first year data,” Jorenby said. “About 30% [of people] who came in as dual users actually stopped vaping the first year and went back to smoking full time. Very few people progressed to not vaping or quitting all nicotine.”The study noted that the results indicated that smokers and dual users took in approximately the same amount of nicotine per day. This suggests that dual users may compensate for smoking fewer cigarettes by obtaining additional nicotine from e-cigarettes.Jorenby added that there are risks involving cigarette smoking even if you start vaping with the intention of never smoking.“Something we’ve known for a couple of years now is that among adolescents — people younger than typical undergrad — who had never tried tobacco but started vaping, were between three to four times more likely to go on and start smoking,” Jorenby said. “There’s a really strong signal that if you pick up e-cigarettes because they’re not tobacco or not combustible, you still have greater risk later on to switching over to cigarettes.”According to a 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics, use of e-cigarettes with higher nicotine concentrations at the baseline was associated with greater levels of combustible cigarette and e-cigarette use at follow-ups, along with a greater intensity of daily use.Fighting Spirits: Ahead of municipal elections, questions loom about future of liquor licensing in downtown Madison

The policy states that smoking is prohibited in all buildings, facilities and vehicles owned, operated or leased by UW. The policy specifies that “smoking” not only includes the burning of any type of lit device, but also “any other smoking equipment or the use of electronic smoking device including, but not limited to, an electronic cigarette, cigar, cigarillo, or pipe.”Kinsey said by reducing and potentially eliminating the use of nicotine products on campus, UW can continue “efforts to provide a safe and healthy environment for students and employees.”Holden said UHS offers help to students who are interested in strategies for quitting smoking or e-cigarettes, including free individual counseling.Warren added that campus policy can impact those trying to quit as well.“Unfortunately, nicotine is hard to quit … However, we know that having a supportive environment helps smokers quit,” Warren said. “That’s why it’s important to have strong 100% tobacco-free college campus policies in place to deter young adults from starting and to support people ready to quit.”Along that line, Warren said several colleges throughout Wisconsin have already implemented policies that target protecting their campuses from secondhand smoke and secondhand aerosol.Regarding recent hospitalizations, Warren said the trends thus far have been concerning.“While much remains to be determined about the reported cases of severe lung disease as well as the lasting health consequences of vaping, CDC and FDA have made clear that vaping and e-cigarette use is not safe,” Warren said. “The American Lung Association has been raising the alarm about e-cigarettes and their use for more than a decade.”Warren called the recent cluster of pulmonary illness “deeply worrisome,” and reiterated her concerns about all tobacco products, not just vaping or smoking.Calkins had a jarring note for anyone who thinks they won’t be affected.“It can happen to anyone,” she said.",Behind the buzz: The truth about vaping,UWM

Or the clinician might react poorly to a client’s involvement in kink, convincing them that engaging in Bondage, Discipline/Domination, Sadism/Submission and Masochism indicates unhealthy aggression.Clients interested in polyamory might experience shame at the hands of therapists who believe firmly in monogamy as a the norm for human relationships. More conservative psychologists or psychiatrists might simply refuse to treat populations exhibiting sexual problems or seeking help with communicating kinky desires to a partner.Therapists might diagnose clients with disorders of sex or gender, turning perfectly healthy alternative sexualities into a problem to be treated.Enter Jay Blevins, a licensed marriage and family therapist working in Madison to treat clients using sex-positive, kink and poly-friendly methods. Blevins has experience with adolescents, their families, LGBTQ+ folks, couples and individuals dealing with everything from depression to discord. His passion about the field stems from his fascination with how people operate and act in relationships, particularly related to “alternative sexuality and alternative relationship structures,” he said.“I love seeing culture changing [and] norms being challenged,” Blevins said.Seeing so many people unhappy due to a sex-negative society motivates Blevins to put emphasis on sex positivity in his work with clients.Hump day: Intimidated by the Kāmasūtra? Don’t be.
While studying in India this past summer, a young woman working at a store recommended what would become my favorite souvenir: a Read…Blevins said he believes sex positivity is central to his work and the rapport he builds with clients. Practicing therapy in a sex-positive way is all about undoing the damage executed by our sex-negative culture, which insists that sexuality is shameful and something to be hidden rather than discussed. Without the freedom to truly explore one’s sexuality, people struggle to express themselves in healthy ways.“Sex is healthy,” Blevins said. “You may do things that aren’t necessarily in your best interest, and we can look at that, but that doesn’t mean the activity itself is wrong. It’s just like eating. We can eat well, we can eat not well. It doesn’t mean eating itself is evil.”Understanding sex in this neutral, nonjudgmental way allows people to comfortably unravel their identity without suffering shame.Even if clients visit Blevins for issues unrelated to sexuality, the topic tends to come up — Blevins said it’s unusual for it not to, as he “believes it’s that important,” he said.This includes people who identify as asexual. Blevins said since asexuality is a type of orientation, unpacking the way asexual identity operates in relationships is equally important to examining one’s sexual identity. No matter the form sexuality takes, its role in identity and relationships is important to personal development and self-actualization.Hump Day: Do it like they do it on the Discovery Channel

For those interested in exploring kinky activities such as paddling, ropes, flogging, spanking or other pursuits outside the normative sexual script, Blevins recommends taking it slow.Partners should learn about kinky interests by reading up on the subject. Consider forming a kinky book club and learn about BDSM from the wealth of options available, or investigate kinky blogs online. Blevins also recommends partners investigate FetLife, an online community of people interested or engaging in kink, fetishes and other activities. Reading and posting on these forums allows kinksters to form a supportive community while learning about proper technique. In addition, Madison offers gatherings of kinky folks in events called “munches,” which can be easily found online.As partners begin to incorporate kink and continue to perform research, communication is essential. Partners can even communicate desires using apps like PlsPlsMe, which allows partners to pick turn-ons and only reveals interests that both people have in common.Feedback is important both in and outside of the bedroom as well, and everyone should feel comfortable indicating when they need activities to slow down or stop. Finally, Blevins points out that kink does not necessarily require a lot of expensive tools. Plenty of household items — ties, spatulas and bungee cords, to name a few — function perfectly as kinky toys. Pinterest even has some suggestions for DIY projects.Hump day: Cunning advice for cunnilingus
Mouths are truly amazing — not only can tongues taste, but lips boast some of the most sensitive tissue on Read…Two kinds of people see Blevins looking for advice about non-monogamy: those interested in beginning polyamory and those who have tried polyamory and failed.Blevins said opening up a relationship is not the solution to a bad relationship, but in fact quite the opposite. A toxic relationship will function poorly whether monogamous or not. Research is also essential here, and plenty of excellent books exist on the subject.Partners should not rush — important decisions about boundaries, publicity and other parties must be made cooperatively in order to ensure proper communication and comfort in a polyamorous relationship.Partners frequently neglect certain considerations, such as whether to tell family, and thus have negative experiences with non-monogamy.

https://badgerherald.com/features/2018/10/09/overcrowded-wisconsin-gubernatorial-candidates-community-programs-address-prison-population-size-reform/,"Oct 9, 2018","A cell measuring eight feet by six feet with a sink, a toilet and a small desk.That is the reality for many inmates in Wisconsin prisons, including former inmate and University of Wisconsin alumnus Derek Hansen.But it was not just Hansen in that eight by six cell. Due to overcrowding in Wisconsin prisons, Hansen had to share that space with another inmate.“At Dodge, which is the intake prison, it was so overcrowded that they would add what they euphemistically called boats — a plastic coffin that can hold a thin mattress and have a third person sleep on the floor,” Hansen said.Hansen was originally sentenced to five years in prison, but he ended up serving three additional years for two parole violations. This is partially due to the policy of crimeless revocation, mandating the re-incarceration of those who violate the terms of their parole but do not commit a new crime.In Wisconsin, stories like Hansen’s are all too common. In a state with a prison capacity of just over 17,000, correctional facilities maintain an incarcerated population of 23,704, straining resources and funding in the process.In the crosshairs of the debates over criminal justice and prison reform are the prisoners themselves, leaving cells overcrowded and Wisconsin taxpayers footing the bill.Gap in prison, university spending reveals questionable priorities
In 2011, the Wisconsin budget crossed a line — literally and figuratively. For the first time, the state allocated more Read…Wisconsin prisons by the numbersWisconsin allocated $2.43 billion to the Department of Corrections in the 2017-19 budget, while that same budget allocated only $2.14 billion to the University of Wisconsin system after years of funding cuts and tuition freezes.This is not the first time Wisconsin has spent more on prisons than the UW system, however. Spending on prisons exceeded that of the UW System in the 2011-13 budget as well, when $2.25 billion was allocated to the Department of Corrections and $2.1 billion to the UW System.Expanding beyond intra-state institutions, correctional spending in Wisconsin is comparatively higher than national numbers. According to the Wisconsin Budget Project, the state spent $267 on corrections per state resident in fiscal year 2015, while the national average is $239. This kind of spending is not the norm even among midwestern states. Illinois spends $175, Minnesota spends $172 and Iowa spends $152.Though the state has steadily increased spending on the DOC, Wisconsin prisons are still over capacity. Of the state’s 32 adult institutions, only the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility and Sturtevant are not over capacity.Still, UW law professor Kenneth Streit said capacity assumes no double celling, which places two inmates per cell, although Streit said prisons do avoid double bunking in segregation and mental health units. Individual prisons are responsible for setting their own capacities.Streit further explained that when federal and state legislatures determine corrections budgets, they assume there will be double bunking in around one-third of the cells in an effort to keep the cost per inmate down. This means that prisons receive insufficient funding to fully accommodate the over-capacity facilities.“It takes roughly the same number of staff to operate a prison at 100 percent as at 133 percent. If Wisconsin’s [incarcerated] population dropped to [capacity], DOC would need to close about 20 to 25 percent of its prisons,” Streit said, because it would alter how lawmakers determined funding for correctional facilities.This issue of overcrowding in state correctional facilities has raised a debate over whether criminal justice reform is necessary. Two prominent voices at the center of the debate this year are incumbent Gov. Scott Walker, R, and state Education Superintendent Tony Evers, his Democratic challenger.UW professor discusses racial disparities in criminal justice system, mass incarceration
University of Wisconsin professor of psychology Patti Coffey led a discussion Monday night about racial disparities in arrests and sentencing Read…What are the candidates planning to do?In a gubernatorial race that leaves Walker trailing Evers, Walker has yet to say much about his plan for criminal justice reform in a state that spends more on its prisons than its higher education system. Walker’s campaign website does not mention criminal justice policies, while Evers’ campaign website mentions proposed reforms he would make to the system as governor.Streit said the Truth in Sentencing law, authored primarily by Walker and passed by the state Legislature in the late 1990s, made it much harder for inmates to be granted parole. Around the same time, state Legislature also increased the maximum sentences for multiple crimes.For measures like these, Streit said the state Legislature can “look tough on crime without having to pay the cost” by not looking at fiscal estimates on laws related to crime — an exception to the norm during lawmaking process.“Although there is a requirement for a fiscal estimate for all other types of legislation, legislators specifically excluded crime-related legislation from fiscal estimates,” Streit said. “Later, when the prison populations increased, the legislators decided to build more prisons rather than look soft on crime.”In an Aug. 7 news conference, Walker said he sees “no value” in visiting prisons in Wisconsin.Meanwhile, Evers has outlined a plan to reduce the prison population through ending crimeless revocations, eliminating mandatory minimums and invest in drug courts, treatment and diversions programs and restorative justice strategies — actions which would experts believe could reduce Wisconsin’s prison population by as much as 50 percent.But in an email to The Badger Herald, Walker campaign spokesman Austin Altenburg claims Evers’ plan would release dangerous criminals back into Wisconsin communities.“Scott Walker remains focused on keeping our communities safe — which he considers a primary role of government — in a way that is accountable to the public and cost-effective for taxpayers,” Altenburg said.Walker recently aired an advertisement condemning a goal expressed by many of the Democratic gubernatorial candidates — reducing the Wisconsin prison population.He has denounced Evers’ plan because 67 percent of current inmates are violent offenders. Walker claims that if the prison population is to be halved immediately, at least 17 percent of people released from prison would be violent offenders — but independent fact-checkers have not determined this claim to be entirely true.In an email to The Badger Herald, Evers clarified that his goal is to reduce the population of non-violent offenders over time, like former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson. He said he does not support the release of violent criminals.“The bottom line is that we need to invest in people, not prisons,” Evers said.2018 Election: Here are the candidates running for public office in Wisconsin this year
Once again, election year is upon us. And here in Wisconsin, the governorship, one U.S. Senate seat, the entire U.S. Read…Programs already in actionWhile politicians wage rhetorical wars, there are current programs in place working to reduce recidivism, and in turn the prison population. They often attempt to mend the relationship between the offender and the community.For example, the UW law school has the Restorative Justice Project, which aims to facilitate reconciliation between victims and offenders. The program aims to help the offender understand the harmful impact of their crime on the victim, community and themselves, which works to reduce recidivism.RJP has a victim-offender dialogue program which provides an environment for the victim and offender to meet in a structured setting and discuss the impact of the crime on their lives.“Restorative justice practices work to address the dehumanization frequently experienced by people in the traditional criminal justice system,” according to RJP’s website. “Instead of viewing a criminal act as simply a violation of a rule or statute, restorative justice sees this action as a violation of people and relationships.”Dane County Community Restorative Courts also attempt to repair the harm caused by crime in the Madison area. Helmed by coordinator Ron Johnson, DCCRC works with community stakeholders, including victims, offenders and residents, to bring harmony to neighborhoods affected by crime.“When a case is settled through restorative justice, it is less likely … that the person will reoffend,” Johnson said. “And [if] they do reoffend, it’s usually a lesser charge. So in a macro sense, we are a prevention program that helps to prevent people from going down that slippery slope.”In the future, Johnson hopes DCCRC will further prevent recidivism by expanding the types of crimes and cases they work with. He also hopes to work with people of other ages, as they currently work only with 17-25 year olds.Inside the prisons, Walker has provided $1 million in additional funding in the 2017-19 budget for vocational training programs and technical college training to rehabilitate offenders. Walker also hopes to provide post-release assistance for 12 months to help former inmates find jobs.“While still incarcerated, inmates participate in programming including cognitive intervention, general work skills and expectations, financial literacy, community resources, job seeking, applications and resumes,” the budget said.Dane County takes steps forward to address issues within criminal justice system
Dane County announced late January they are working to identify and respond to adults with mental health and substance abuse Read…Possible solutionsStreit said the most important tool Wisconsin could use in their criminal justice system is reliable supervision for probation and parole. He also said these programs should also include mental health and addiction treatments without a waiting list.Streit estimated the state could drop its prison population by about 12,000-13,000, or about five percent per year over the next ten years.Another option is to allow judges to use indeterminate sentencing in the hopes that prison will rehabilitate people, Streit said. Indeterminate sentencing occurs when a judge decides a sentence will consist of a range of years. During this time period, the state parole board has the ability to determine if the convicted person is eligible for parole.This lies in contrast to the current system, which Streit said relies on determinate sentencing or “truth in sentencing.” This mandates that no matter what the person does in prison, such as completion of programs, they will not be let out even a day earlier.Whatever policies end up being implemented, the issue of criminal justice reform is on the minds of Wisconsin voters now more than in recent elections, according to polls from recent election cycles. In a Marquette poll in August, 14 percent of respondents said criminal justice reform and prisons are their first or second most important issue. In past polls, the issue has not been as clearly highlighted.Going forward, Wisconsin could take several routes to reduce the prison population and, in turn, associated costs. But the fate of the state’s prisons and its inmates lies largely in the hands of the next governor.","Overcrowded: Wisconsin gubernatorial candidates, community programs address prison population size, reform",UWM

The simple desire to be cared for translates easily into kink, and when conflated with role play, becomes a kinky activity called “age play.”Age play is a sexual or nonsexual type of roleplaying in which partners treat one another as if they were different ages. Kinksters might portray a wide range of ages, from babies to the elderly, by using props and changing their behavior.Age play can mean a wide variety of roles, from a 2-year-old playing with blocks to a teenager sneaking out of the house and being caught by the cops, to an infant in diapers being changed by their “mommy.”Hump day: Cunning advice for cunnilingus
Mouths are truly amazing — not only can tongues taste, but lips boast some of the most sensitive tissue on Read…As with any other sexual activity, only consenting adults should participate in age play after negotiating boundaries and discussing the nuances of a scene. Bringing up a kink such as age play might feel intimidating, since so many taboos and ideas about “perversion” are attached to the concept.Never simply jump into baby talk in the bedroom or suggest this activity in the middle of sex. Bring up age play in a neutral space, explain why it sounds hot, and remain positive about the interest.Suggesting kinks as if they are weird or embarrassing will make partners feel weird or embarrassed. Instead, frame age play as a fresh, new adventure to try out together, and conduct extensive research before buying those adult diapers.Importantly, psychologists do not consider age play related to pedophilia; like other decent human beings, individuals engaged in role play find child abuse despicable. Children have nothing to do with age play — it’s all about playing pretend.In fact, some participants may engage in role play to reclaim an abusive experience and connect it to pleasure rather than trauma. On the other hand, survivors of childhood trauma might also find this particular kink triggering, and this is important to consider when engaging in age play.Decide on a safe word beforehand, so if someone needs to escape the scene they can use it, stop activity immediately and begin after care.Hump Day: Glow up with glow-in-the-dark condoms
Despite STI prevention and birth control campaigns’ tireless efforts to frame condoms as fun and exciting, most people do not Read…People participate in age play for a wide range of reasons. Maybe they spend all day in charge of others at their job and want to come home and let their lover make all the decisions. Maybe they find humiliation or belittling treatment arousing. Maybe they want to regress back to a simpler time and be cared for by someone else, or explore a role they never had the chance to experience.Maybe they want to relive an experience from their youth, such as having sex for the first time, or perhaps they just really enjoy dressing up and acting like a little kid or angry parent. Maybe spanking and discipline appeal to them. Perhaps the sensation of diapers, thumb-sucking or dragging a blankie around seems appealing.Most folks interested in age play enjoy exploring the power dynamic often present in kinky activities, and age play offers a clearly defined exchange of power between a dominant “older” partner and a submissive “younger” partner.Diaper play is closely related with “watersports,” a fetish for urine that draws on aspects of humiliation and arousal. Feeling helpless might not be pleasant in uncontrolled situations, but in a pre-negotiated kinky scene it can be incredibly satisfying to let go of these inhibitions.Hump Day: Why scheduling sex doesn’t have to kill spontaneity
As the semester heats up and schedules become crowded with class, work and whatever other nonsense, intimacy may seem like Read…Though “daddy” has entered vocabulary as a colloquial term for an older or more powerful significant other, this term also refers to a more specific age play fetish. Partners engaging in daddy/little relationships designate one partner as the disciplinarian and caregiver (or “daddy”), while the other plays a younger, more vulnerable submissive role (the “little”).Though this dynamic is often depicted as heterosexual, all types of relationships participate in parent/little roleplay. Some daddy/little partners set aside a specific time to play, while others engage in this power difference during all aspects of their relationship — often referred to as a “24/7” relationship in the kink community.Littles often enjoy the sensation of innocence and simplicity that accompanies a daddy/little dynamic, embracing a childlike sense of wonder that elicits intimacy and comfort. Littles might enjoy primping themselves for “daddy,” wearing pink bows, pigtails and other childlike props.Of course, many of these activities might squick some folks out—“squick” meaning that an activity makes us go “ick,” but we support the freedom of consenting adults to make those well-informed and risk-aware choices. A sex-positive perspective on age play means while we might not choose to don the adult diapers, we respect others’ decisions to do so.","Hump Day: From diapers or daddies, age play explores it all",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2016/02/17/hump-day-put-away-erotic-toys-for-unconventional-sex-get-kinky-with-these-five-freaky-sensations/,"Feb 17, 2016","Often the word “kink” brings to mind plenty of tools used to create intense sensations: ropes, paddles, floggers, nipple clamps — the list goes on. But kinky moments hardly require an entire dungeon full of materials.In fact, the internal experience can categorize many fetishes and kinks rather than objects utilized. As the most powerful sex organ, the brain contains fantasies, desires and psychological elements of sexuality.Though sex may feel entirely external, most of that pleasure manifests inside of the psyche.The desire or act of displaying genitals in a public or semi-public space qualifies an individual as an exhibitionist. Unfortunately, this particular erotic interest has the potential to negatively impact others.Any eyewitnesses present at an exhibitionistic moment must be consenting adults, rather than innocent bystanders being subjected to unwarranted genitals.Exhibitionism, however, can happen without offending others or demonstrating problematic behavior. Luckily, creating the illusion of a public space titillates an exhibitionist without subjecting others to their actions. Locate a window many floors above street level or facing a brick wall — this option allows one to feel the vulnerable thrill that comes with being seen, but without disturbing others. Consider getting it on in front of a camera to expand on that “being-watched” feeling.Exhibitionist acts range from mooning and streaking to flashing. “Anasyrma” describes lifting a skirt to reveal one’s self not wearing underwear, while “reflectoporn” consists of photographs with nude figures reflected in mirrored surfaces, such as TVs and toasters.While hardly innately pathological, exhibitionism may resemble a disorder if it results in harm to the self or others. Treat this particular subset of desire with care to ensure that exhibitionism remains contained and does not disturb others. Exhibitionism can easily become criminal, and remember consent of all parties is necessary for any sexual activity.Voyeurism is the flip side of exhibitionism — voyeurs experience arousal when spying on people engaged in intimate behaviors such as sex, masturbation or undressing. Beyond observing, some voyeurs may create videos or photographs of the event.Just as with exhibitionism, voyeurism presents the dangerous possibility of non-consenting participants. Those interested in voyeurism should create role-play scenes to experience the kink without disturbing others. Simply arrange a time and place for partners to undress or pleasure themselves, then spy away without any harm done.Creating photographs and videos to share later might also satisfy voyeuristic urges. Never, ever watch or photograph individuals without their awareness or consent — to get off on this material without conscious, informed participation would be wrong.The trick to these potentially problematic interests is to create the illusion of an exhibitionistic or voyeuristic situation without truly violating anyone’s privacy.Consensual sexual humiliation defines a surprising number of kinks and fetishes.A submissive partner who gleans sexual arousal from humiliation may get off from pretending to be a dog loyal to its master (the dominant partner). Other forms of verbal erotic humiliation include degrading name-calling, disparaging comments on physical appearance, requiring the sub to ask permission for everyday activities and forced flattery.Physical erotic humiliation encompasses ejaculating on the face, servitude, deprivation of privacy, discipline, being forced to dress a certain way, objectification and a submissive partner asking permission to orgasm.The key to enjoying erotic humiliation without sidestepping into abuse is consent. The submissive should desire these activities completely and discuss specific boundaries and safe words beforehand to prevent any possible discomfort or triggers. After all, erotic humiliation mimics actual embarrassment very closely and this experience can be intense. Submissive partners may be completely comfortable with certain insults, but react badly with others.Those that engage in 24/7 master-slave relationships live in constant power dynamics by telling submissive partners what to do. Just as with gender and sexuality, kinks operate on a spectrum and can be up for all sorts of interpretation.Also known as orgasm denial, erotic sexual denial consists of maintaining a heightened state of sexual arousal without orgasm. Orgasm control is commonly practiced in BDSM and sexual bondage communities and often includes a chastity device to prevent any genital stimulation whatsoever.Dominant partners may tie down or handcuff submissive partners to prevent further movement. The titillating experience of being teased and finally allowing the experience to culminate in orgasm can be intoxicating for many kinksters.Generally, three types of sexual denial exist. Tease and denial describes stimulation until one reaches the brink of orgasm — then stimulation ends completely. Often this feels uncomfortable (blue balls, anyone?), but creates feelings of intense arousal. If orgasm occurs after this period, kinksters sometimes refer to it as a “ruined orgasm,” since they are often less intense than normal orgasms.Tie and tease consists of restraining the submissive partner, escalating the sensation of helplessness induced by bondage and orgasm control. Total denial avoids genital stimulation altogether; this is where the chastity belt or device comes in. Sexual denial can be a tool to control others, since it often produces psychological dependency.Practice with care to avoid a potentially abusive experience, and always negotiate the event carefully beforehand.Listening to a partner gush over body parts — hips, lips, nips and everything in between — enhances confidence and bonding between partners. Body worship may occur in order to praise one’s physical form, or it may take more aggressive forms such as face-sitting or spanking.Body worship may take the tone of BDSM if the dominant partner reinforces the sub’s inferiority. The submissive partner may lick or stroke the worshipped body part while the dominant partner remains aloof.Vagina and penis worship are both common, often including the submissive partner in a kneeling position in front of the genitals while engaged in oral contact. Foot worship exists as a subset of foot fetishes, one of the more common fetishes in existence.Body worship may extend into non-physical aspects of a relationship. Be sure to stay within the boundaries of body worship discussed beforehand.","Hump day: Put away erotic toys for unconventional sex, get kinky with these five freaky sensations",UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2015/07/21/hump-day-how-to-consensually-conquer-hook-up-culture-coitus/,"Jul 21, 2015","Welcome to college, an era of experimentation and education that reaches far outside the classroom.Such newfound independence and freedom from parental eyes inspire freshmen to experience new things — including casual sex. Although older generations may insist that casual sex is a fresh new millennial horror, we hardly invented the practice. Technological advances in the 1920s, the sexual revolution of the 1960s and decreased dating have shaped the hook-up culture we know today.Hook-up culture flourishes within college campuses such as University of Wisconsin, where alcohol is treated as an essential part of social life. Of course, casual, commitment-free sex hardly requires alcohol, but the thrill of lowered inhibitions and dimly lit house parties certainly oil the gears for some people.Hook-up partners could be strangers, acquaintances or close friends. Many freshmen leave the dorms aiming to bring someone home to their lofted bed, but this doesn’t mean everyone must participate in hook-up culture. But for those who do, here are some friendly guidelines to follow. Hump Day: How to flog, spank and hit for maximal pleasure
Hump Day has delved into the complex pleasure center of BDSM in the past, but now it’s time to spice Read…Ambiguity AboundsThe term “hook-up” can mean many different things — anywhere from sex to making out with clothes on. People use the term loosely to fit their comfort level. However, without a concrete definition, the opportunity for uninformed consent presents itself.If someone asks to “hook up,” all involved partners should be fully aware of what that entails. Consent should be clear, freely given, enthusiastic and informed — and the absence of a “no” does not mean “yes.” Alcohol endangers the “freely given” portion of consent; when someone is passed out, vomiting, slurring or otherwise incapacitated, they are unable to give consent. If you wouldn’t give someone the keys to your car, then you shouldn’t be having sex with them. The definition for “hook-up” may be ambiguous, but consent is not.Hump Day: Does penis size really matter?
Our culture constantly tells us that bigger is better; huge houses, supersized meals, skyscrapers … and penises. Porn sites boast Read…Doing the DeedWhen going out and aiming to hook up, bring a few important items: a barrier method, dorm room keys, WiscCard, a buddy and a safe way home (even if it’s the next morning in last night’s clothes). Feeling extra prepared? Wear your favorite underwear, bring plenty of lube and make sure to pocket a few bucks for Ian’s Pizza later.That said, dorm sex is a tricky beast. Lofted beds, roommates and semi-public spaces make hooking up seem like an awful lot of trouble. Communicate early on with roommates about boundaries, and decide on a system to alert one another to arrival of hook-up partners. Getting it on in showers, dens and other shared spaces is not only explicitly forbidden, but violates other’s personal space. Subjecting floor mates to sexy noises/sights without consent is wrong.But the thrill of bringing someone home to hook up in the dorms delights many. Luckily those lofted beds invite the missionary position, a classic that provides excellent clitoris stimulation for those that have them.Enjoy one another and explore.

Monogamous folk only need to be tested for STIs once or twice a year, but those enjoying more partners should visit their local STI clinic three to four times every year. University Health Services offers free STI and HIV testing for all UW students.Take advantage and visit them at 333 East Campus Mall.Also, apps such as Tinder, Grindr, Zoosk, OkCupid, CMB (Coffee Meets Bagel), Pure, and endless others put hooking up in the palm of our hands. Hooking up is easy to organize through apps that offer instant conversation (such as Tinder), but make sure to meet in a public place to meet them first. Of course, one can abuse the power of faceless communication and deceive others. But being authentic online is within reach for most of us, especially since our generation grew up with the Internet.Slut Shaming & Double StandardsIf an alien were to arrive on planet Earth to observe human beings, they would immediately be able to understand gender roles and stereotypes based on some college students discussing hook-ups.Women who don’t have sex are often perceived as prudes, but if she has too many partners and she’s a whore. Meanwhile, men with partners aplenty are known as studs or players. This dichotomy is sexist and false. The amount of sex a person has — and the people that they choose to hook up with — has nothing to do with their value.Plus, these stereotypes have nothing to do with the true motivation behind hook-ups. Anecdotal evidence regarding college women’s sexual lives revealed that they avoided relationships because they found it too time-consuming. The combination of school, jobs, internships, extracurriculars and friends make it difficult to balance a relationship. Casual intimacy allows people to experiment sexually without expending excessive emotional energy.That being said, plenty of people prefer relationships, which can begin in all sorts of ways. Every day people’s one night stands are turning into the love of their life. Courting comes in all shapes and sizes.Welcome to UW, Badgers.

I think I may have the craziest libido of all time, I think about sex like 90 percent of the day, so I was wondering maybe why that is. What is libido, how can it cloud our judgement? -AnonymousLots of folks worry that their libido is too high or too low. But the fact is that libido varies from person to person, and there is no reason to worry unless your life is adversely affected by your high sex drive. In fact, lots of people would kill for that level of horniness!What is libido?Libido is sex drive — a person’s overall desire for sexy time. Someone can be plenty turned on without actually wanting to have sex. Lots of different factors affect whether or not people want to be sexual. Hormones that influence libido include androgens, estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin and vasopressin. Testosterone is the ruler of sex drive hormones; the more testosterone, the higher the libido. Although men have larger amounts of testosterone than women, this by no means indicates that all men are always hornier. Oxytocin, the “bonding hormone” released when we are intimate with another person, is also thought to influence our desire for sex. Psychological factors — such as stress level, depression, exhaustion and pre-existing traumas — play a role in libido levels too.Hump Day: How to toss salads like a pro
What was once a rude gesture of denial — “kiss my ass” — has recently gained increasing prevalence as a Read…Highs & LowsIf you’re in your 20s, that might explain why your sex drive is very high. At this age, estrogen, progesterone and testosterone productions are through the roof as the body prepares itself for reproduction. For people who ovulate, libido will be particularly high just before ovulation — very helpful for evolution, since people are more likely to seek out sex during this time.People with penises tend to be hornier the longer it has been since they last ejaculated. Many people recommend aphrodisiacs (foods rumored to raise sex drive) to increase sexual desires, but no studies have proven a connection between food and libido. However, regularly eating foods that increase circulation — such as salmon, strawberries, blueberries, asparagus, beans, legumes and other antioxidant-rich foods — can improve blood flow to the genitals and therefore libido. In fact, anything that improves circulation will increase libido, including exercise. Spending a little time at the Southeast Recreational Facility every week can increase confidence, build muscle for better contractions during orgasm and improve blood flow to the genitals.Lots of things can lower libido. Psychological factors such as lack of privacy, stress, exhaustion, distraction, depression and trauma may decrease sexual desire. Any issue or illness hindering testosterone production will hurt libido. Being underweight can disrupt normal hormone production and therefore libido. Smoking and alcohol abuse also disturb hormonal balances, resulting in a lower libido. Medications that lower libido include hormonal contraception (ironic, huh?), antidepressants, antipsychotics, opioids and beta-blockers. If your medication affects sex drive, let your doctor know so that you can explore alternatives or solutions together.Not everyone has a libido — asexual folks lack a sex drive entirely. As long as you are comfortable with your sex drive, there is no need to change it. But do not hesitate to talk to a doctor about libido; just because it is a sexual problem does not mean that you have no right to be concerned.Hump Day on the elusive, infrequent nature of female orgasms
Welcome to the week before finals, when stress and caffeine levels are running higher than ever all over campus. Nothing Read…How can it cloud our judgement?Sex drive may affect decision-making. Arousal sure does. In a study conducted by Ariely and Lowenstein (2005), participants (notably all male undergraduates presumed to be heterosexual) were more attracted to potential sexual activities. These prospective actions included activities considered deviant, risky and even harmful to others. So further research is definitely needed, but sex definitely sounds better to most horny people, of course. It really depends on how you handle your sex drive. Higher libidos may motivate people to pursue behaviors that get them laid.But a high sex drive should not cause anyone to do harm … and usually will not. Sex and the motivation for it, if experienced positively, can produce joy, intimacy, satisfaction and understanding of desires, fantasies and even bodies. We exist in a sex-negative society which often causes people to feel ashamed of perfectly normal thoughts and preferences. Plus, a high sex drive gives plentiful opportunities to masturbate (vibrators, anyone?) and share intimate experiences with others.

If those memories have been successfully blocked out, “Big Mouth” is back to remind us of so many traumatic moments that were doomed to happen to the average group of 12 and 13-year-olds.Season two premiered last Friday keeping the charismatic comedy within the show fresh and alive. This time, the storyline expands as we see more perspectives from Nick, Andrew and Jessi’s classmates and family members, along with the entangled relationships they develop.The show highlights the intense sexual tension and confusion that often arises in our society during puberty — in cartoon form. Hormone monsters serve as the driving force of these feelings and all the astonishing decisions these characters make in their everyday lives as they grow more curious, horny and explorative.With attention span in mind, your Netflix recommendations this September

Recurrent themes of peer pressure, slut-shaming and rumor spreading are portrayed through the public nature these events always seems to play out in.This also allows for more educational perspectives to be shared. A sex ed episode covered common misconceptions about topics like planned parenthood and STD’s, even noting the significance of birth control for men outside of the commonly mentioned use of condoms or female contraception.Discussions like these allow pubescent boys and girls to recognize the difference between truth and myth, and see how both partners should take precautions to be responsible for sexual behaviors.‘Big Mouth’ provides comic relief among embarrassing, educational moments

Showcasing a variety of mediums such as the condom, pill, IUD and even the pull out method, the aspect of interaction allows less straightforward questions to be settled in a calm, comfortable setting.One new addition, the Shame Monster, deserves a noteworthy mention as he gains a large role terrorizing nearly everyone in the show. It’s clear that shame is present in all of us at some point in life, yet how each of us decides to deal with such shame may lead to more guilt, or a positive path to being comfortable with one’s sexuality.Comfort and discomfort often balance each other throughout the series as this group of newly-aged teens attempt to figure out what they want in life without following the expectations of others.

Unfortunately for the popular book franchise, it’s unlikely anyone will leave the theater in good spirits. That is, unless, they know what to expect: a mediocre, undeveloped plot with inaccurate depictions of BDSM.An adaptation of E.L. James’ best-selling novel, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is the story of Anastasia “Ana” Steele (Dakota Johnson, “Need for Speed”), a quiet, naïve English literature major and Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan, “Flying Home”), a smoldering, handsome entrepreneur in Seattle. As the young founder of a massively successful corporation, Grey pursues Ana, who is confused by his attraction to her. Yet, he succeeds in introducing her to a world of sexual dominance and submission. Before she can realize it, Ana becomes enraptured in the fantasy of BDSM, even as it paves the way for a twisted change of events.Given the subject matter, it was confusing to discover that “Fifty Shades” could put someone to sleep. How in the world could this movie be this boring? Then again, considering the story’s lack of a quality plotline, especially in the redundant, 500-page mediocrity of a novel, this is hardly shocking. The screenwriter’s job must have been a nightmare, having to navigate around its lack of substance. That being said, Johnson and Dornan worked remarkably well with what they were given. The only positive element of this film — cinematically speaking — was its soundtrack and score.Hump Day: spice up Valentine’s Day with domination, submission this year
’Tis the season for roses, heart-shaped boxes full of chocolate, sappy gifts and … bondage. Due to the upcoming release Read…Though “Fifty Shades” has become a nationwide obsession, people are embracing domestic abuse and childhood trauma packaged as a BDSM relationship in the movie.Grey is depicted as an intense, mysterious man with a terrifying need for control and a painful past. Grey uses sex as his weapon, his dark attachment, to battle his troubling experiences. None of this should make him a desirable object of fantasy. The spineless behavior of Anastasia Steele only reinforces this idea. She unravels before him, becoming an unhealthy version of a “submissive” that reads more like a victim.Despite an overwhelming frustration with this aspect of the franchise, the movie did contain some actual clarity. For example, Christian Grey gets one thing right after Ana asks him if he is a sadist: he corrects her, calling himself a “dominant.” Engaging in BDSM definitely does not constitute sadism. In fact, its practice is not all that uncommon. Unlike the film, it’s about the consensual control that is handed off between two partners. It’s not the movie’s image of pain, degradation, contracts and constant one-sided activity.Another moment of clarity came with Ana’s overdue revelation. She finally develops a backbone and begins to come to grips with the dire reality of her situation. Her tortured, yet necessary decision to leave Grey concludes the film, the first time during which his disturbed nature is far from glorified.As a holistic work, “Fifty Shades” is not romantic. It is not sexy. It is disturbing, and it is frustrating, ending up depiction of nonconsensual, violent relations. Yet, the issues that have emerged from its criticism truly need to be discussed. This movie is not the first form of media to romanticize abuse and trauma. Perhaps the massive hype of the franchise will lead to the conversation many are too afraid to begin. But ultimately, a movie with inappropriate glorification and an absence of a comprehensive plotline does not bring anything cinematically substantive to the table. Safe to say, “Fifty Shades of Grey” just couldn’t pull it off.Rating: 1.7 out of 5",‘Fifty Shades of Grey’: a frustrating misrepresentation of BDSM with no substantive plot,UWM

Though it received criticism from Mothers Against Drunk Driving, many lawmakers supported the proposal, and its passage would certainly spell change for drinking culture here at University of Wisconsin.I’m 20 years old. That means in the U.S., I am not of legal drinking age. But I’m writing this column from Dublin, Ireland, where the minimum legal drinking age is 18. I have been abroad since May, in several different countries, and I have been of legal drinking age in all of them.I won’t lie — I like being of age, if for no other reason than it’s nice to be able to order a glass of wine with dinner or go to a pub Thursday night with a couple friends.App designed by UW researchers proven to help overcome drug, alcohol addictions
A team of University of Wisconsin researchers have developed a mobile smartphone app proven to help individuals overcome drug and Read…My impression of drinking culture outside the U.S. has been that because the drinking age is lower, drinking doesn’t seem to be as taboo as it is in the U.S. I think people derive a certain level of thrill from having to sneak around, trying not to get caught, which ultimately could lead to more dangerous behavior. If the minimum legal drinking age was lower, as with many places in Europe, or nonexistent, as the case with China, there may be less of that “thrill” aspect to drinking, thereby leading to more responsible choices.Furthermore, given that in the U.S., 60 percent of 18 year-olds, 70 percent of 19 year-olds and 77 percent of 20 year-olds report some level of alcohol use, it would make sense to simply provide young adults with the necessary resources to be safe. In the same way that abstinence-only sexual education has been proven ineffective, it’s arguable that enforcing an MLDA of 21 only leads to reckless, uninformed underage drinking. In a sense, legalization could lead to safer regulation.At least, that was the column I wanted to write. My bitterness toward having to go back to Madison in January when I will still be 20, having just lived for 7 months of legal age, came out and I wanted to write a column that said “Lower the drinking age! It’s better for everyone!”But the reality is, it’s not.Game day culture divides student body
Game day in Madison, from the relatively biased point of view of a student obviously rooting for the Badgers and Read…UW public affairs professor Jason Fletcher recently published a paper exploring the effects of legal alcohol access on participation in risky behaviors associated with drinking. Fletcher explored what the effects of lowering the MLDA to 18 might be and entertained the argument that it should be lowered, but ultimately concluded that the results from his study “provide no evidence consistent with this argument and suggest that individuals living with their parents face even higher consequences of legal alcohol access than individuals living away from their parents.”If the United States lowered the drinking age to 18, this could lead to increased underage alcohol consumption, starting at a lower age, in a sort of “trickle down” effect. According to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, about 20 percent of Americans aged 16-17 and about 7.4 percent aged 14-15 report having consumed alcohol in the past month. These figures pale in comparison to those from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which indicate that about 38 percent of European youth aged 15-16 report having consumed alcohol in the past month. The data demonstrate that a lower MLDA bears a correlation with increased underage drinking.Illegality aside, starting drinking at a young age can have remarkable negative consequences on the body. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics to the American Journal of Public Health to the Office of the Surgeon General, experts agree: Alcohol consumption as a teen can have an extreme impact on brain development in the frontal lobe, can lead to interference in development of skills for emotional regulation and decision making. Earlier engagement in consumption of alcohol is also linked to higher risk of chronic mental health difficulties, such as addiction, depression and propensity for violence.Binge drinking poses serious health risks — keep spring break balanced
Every year in March, thousands of college students flock to Florida, Texas, Alabama, Mexico, the Bahamas and more for spring Read…The MLDA also has a very strong impact on the frequency of alcohol-related traffic accidents and fatalities. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration estimates implementation of the MLDA of 21 has lowered the rate of alcohol-related traffic fatalities by 13 percent, saving about 28,765 lives since 1975.The data speaks for itself: lowering the drinking age would bring more danger to the lives of teens and young adults, as well as those around them.I really did want to advocate for a lower drinking age — this is an opinion I formed as the sum of my experiences in Madison, other places in the U.S. and places with different drinking cultures around the world. But the research on the topic, which has been conducted by experts using proper scientific research methods, does not support my theory, which I created by just going to random pubs for fun.In situations like these, it is so easy to let the desired outcome cloud proper judgment of what the outcome actually ends up being. It’s important to form opinions and develop theories about society and how it might be impacted by various factors. But it’s even more important to not continue to perpetuate illogical, nonsensical thoughts when they have been proven wrong by hard facts and research.Cait Gibbons (cgibbons@badgerherald.com) is a junior studying math and Chinese.",Don’t ignore the data — a drinking age of 21 is better for society,UWM

Where both of her previous albums featured heavily produced, anthemic pop tracks such as “Tik Tok” and “Die Young,” “Rainbow” leads off with the acoustic ballad “Bastards.”However, don’t mistake the softer instrumentation for Kesha losing her raw edge. While the backing track for “Bastards” is much more mellow than we’re used to hearing from Kesha, listening to it brings a quietly vengeful, profane vibe, announcing that she will not let the struggles of the past five years ruin her life or career.Freakfest 2017 lineup includes Grammy-nominated DRAM
Madison is home to the region’s largest Halloween party, Freakfest, and this year’s celebration will bring a variety of musical Read…The fact that Kesha did not release an album between 2012 and now was not her own decision, but a result of an extended legal battle between herself and her former producer, Lukasz Gottwald.According to a 2016 report by Rolling Stone, Kesha sued Gottwald in 2014 to end their contracts, claiming he emotionally, physically and sexually abused her. Gottwald countersued, and although the legal battles still rage on now, Kesha managed to win her musical freedom at the very least.“Rainbow” does present a much less unified vision than her past albums, but it does present a much more real image of herself than the processed, manufactured pop star she was while working with Gottwald. While “Bastards” rings of a more vengeful Alanis Morissette, while the second track “Let ‘Em Talk,” feels like an album track from The White Stripes.But the headliner of the album is the fifth track, “Praying.” For anyone who wasn’t following the legal battles or anything about Kesha’s life and struggles since 2012, this will sound rather jarring. So much of Kesha’s previous discography felt vapid and detached; the party girl who sang about getting wasted and laid. But “Praying” shows deep musical understanding and talent.When Kesha was still working with Gottwald and performing with a dollar sign in her stage name, her work carried a strong vibe of “ugh, no way can she perform live.” Songs like “Take it Off” and “Blah Blah Blah” didn’t exactly portray her as a musical genius, and under Gottwald’s direction, she didn’t really seem to evolve.Where to dance the night away in Madison
Majestic Theatre Located just past the Capitol on King Street, the Majestic is Madison’s oldest performance space, and it may Read…But “Rainbow,” and “Praying” specifically, shows an evolution that’s pretty rare in albums that look to produce radio hits. For sake of comparison, look at Taylor Swift’s new song “Look What You Made Me Do,” which is artistic evolution in the same way that a rotting orange is ripening. She’s falling off of the mountain Kesha is summiting.And oh, that voice. Kesha was never allowed to flex her vocal muscles on her first two albums, but she shines on “Rainbow.” It’s not technically perfect, but these songs don’t want it to be. Her raw belting on “Praying” actually conveys emotion, a depressingly rare commodity in pop nowadays.Beyond the singles, “Rainbow” is strong, if a little stylistically incoherent. A song like “Boogie Feet” feels a little more like the Kesha we remember, albeit more herself and less like the carefully cultivated image she was forced to present.The album leaves the listener waiting for what’s coming next, especially after that haunting high note at the end of “Praying.” There aren’t five other people on the Top 20 who can hit that note right now, guaranteed.",Kesha moves past ‘party girl’ persona in latest album,UWM

https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2015/02/26/chris-brown-tyga-bore-with-lp-exclusively-about-bitches-marijuana/,"Feb 26, 2015","Chris Brown should go back to the early 2000’s and relive the glory of “Kiss, Kiss” and “Run;” the days before the domestic abuse conviction, 2013 altercation with Frank Ocean over a parking space and numerous other probation violations.  At least then he wasn’t churning out albums full of boring beats and sexually-explicit lyrics.Fan of a Fan: The Album is the impetus of Brown’s growing tendency toward extremely slow and drawn out melodies. Unfortunately, this time Brown decided to bring Tyga down with him into the sea of poor production. Fan of a Fan: The Album is an adaptation of Brown and Tyga’s mixtape from 2010, and the pair are featured on every song on the album. According to Billboard, this reboot is part of a larger installment of mixtapes Brown will convert to LPs.Despite having producers like DJ Mustard and features like Schoolboy Q and 50 Cent, the full-length album still feels like a mixtape with an abundance of collaborators. The production is crisp but underdeveloped and incredibly stale. It’s a total snoozer from the first track to the last, with the exception of one or two bangers. Even “Bitches N Marijuana,” featuring Schoolboy Q, is a trap banger in the most basic sense but quickly becomes monotonous.Besides the production, the most egregious perpetrator of mediocrity are the incredibly obscene lyrics. While Brown’s niche audience is pubescent teens experimenting with their burgeoning sexuality on the dance floors of bat mitzvahs and confirmations, West Coast rapper Tyga’s target listeners enjoy hearing the word “bitch” dozens of times in one track (in “Rack City,” Tyga raps “bitch” 59 times). The combination is a recipe for disaster; Tyga may add a shiny trap sheen to Brown’s degrading image, but he also adds materialistic and offensive language to every track.The album’s crude lyricism feels most like a pair of horny teens live-narrating porn to a Bowwow beat from his Wanted album. Instead of rapping alongside Ciara about finding someone special, Tyga and Brown enumerate the ways in which they can “fuck your bitch.” Although this is certainly not uncharted waters for the rap industry, Fan of a Fan: The Album takes shallow and sexually explicit lyrics to a new level and does not provide any innovative or interesting beats to back it up.The first single off of the album, “Ayo,” is a catchy club banger. While the light synth beat is distinctly Brown, the lyrics have a Rebecca Black-esque sound. Instead of singing about the complexities of preparing for the weekend on Friday, Tyga and Brown rap about their “bougie” lifestyle in the most conversational way. The word “ayo” peppers the hook and sounds awkwardly poppy:“All my bitches got real hair chilling with the top down / Screaming like ayo / I’mma take her ass down when she bring her friend around / Fuck ‘em both like ayo.”The lyrics throughout the LP follow this sentiment. In the world of the Fan of a Fan, the only important activities are smoking weed, “licking pussy” and hosting parties. The hook of “Remember Me” insinuates that cunnilingus is the only way to leave an impression on a lady friend:“I want to see a whole lot of licking that’s a memory / Bet I make that pussy remember me.”Other lyrics include, “I got bitches N marijuana, ooh I got ‘em” from “Bitches N Marijuana,” and “Never use a nigga, but she abuse the dick / I lick the pussy, let it air dry” from “D.G.I.F.U.”The album as a whole feels like Brown’s desperate attempt to reinvigorate his dated early-2000’s style with Tyga’s profane and underdeveloped lyricism. The product is a drab full-length better suited for putting listeners to sleep than helping them turn up.On top of it all, Brown will have a lot of trouble promoting the album internationally after the Canadian Prime Minister denied his tour access into the country, according to CBC News Toronto. Immigration issues like this can stem from criminal records, Stéphane Malépart, a spokesman for Canada Border Services, said to CBC News Toronto.Don’t worry Canada, you’re not missing much.","Chris Brown, Tyga bore with LP exclusively about ‘bitches,’ ‘marijuana’",UWM

At least, that’s what a group of Canadian scientists found in 2009 when they were unable to find any men who had never been exposed to pornography. (So, I guess, all Canadian men have watched porn.) But women and people of other genders watch porn, too, and recent technological advancements have made it incredibly easy to locate X-rated material on the internet. According to research published in the Huffington Post, pornography websites get more visitors each month than Netflix, Amazon and Twitter combined. The days of sheepishly purchasing nudie mags and videos are over; today, the Internet is for porn.Porn gets an awfully bad rap. People claim that it objectifies women, abuses performers and promotes false depictions of sex. It is true that some pornography sucks, but ethical pornography is out there, too. Ethical pornography features consenting adults who take part in the sex industry without coercion or manipulation. Adult photos and films offer people the chance to explore their desire in a safe way without requiring a partner. Porn is especially helpful for people with unrealizable fetishes (desires that cannot be pursued in real life, such as centaur fetishes). Couples can view X-rated materials together to find new ideas for the bedroom. Exposure to pornography could even serve as an outlet for those with violent urges that might otherwise turn their fantasy into reality.Of course, many users utilize pornography for masturbation. A word about whackin’ it solo: it’s damn good for you. Masturbating helps us learn what feels good so that we can communicate with potential partners. And masturbating with porn can aid us in deciding what fantasies might work for us. Medical Daily reports that rubbing one out releases endorphins, relieves stress, releases sexual tension, offsets insomnia, boosts metabolism, suppresses migraines and may even improve fertility.Despite a history of cultural shaming of masturbation and pornography, these activities offer opportunities to explore our sexuality in productive and healthy ways. The human body — nude or otherwise — is nothing to be ashamed of. Sexual education in schools continues to be dismal or nonexistent, so we should utilize any resources we can — including pornography. However, pornography is by no means an accurate portrayal of sex. Porn stars are actors playing roles. And some of these people are abused by the porn industry. Consumers of porn should seek out materials that are fully consensual and ethical. For those who worry about possible sexism in pornography, feminist pornography seeks to eradicate inequality from the porn industry while maintaining the sexy parts we like. As long as we enter the world of pornography armed with knowledge and proper expectations, adult material can be super hot and fun to enjoy alone or with others.Hump Day tackles how to sext like a pro

Pornography should only involve legal adults — anything else is child pornography. If pornography is not consensual, it is human trafficking. Make an effort to view pornography where the actors express consent.Rule 34 of the internet states that if the concept exists, there’s porn of it. Websites like Pornhub (link NSFW) and Redtube (link NSFW) allow users to browse categories: everything from orgies to hardcore to Hentai. In order to find the video that is perfect for you, peruse a big free website for a while. Not sure what you want to watch? Click on a few different videos and see what makes your record skip!So you’ve been watching Xtube (link NSFW) and decide that it looks like a ton of fun to create your own porn film. After all, most pornography websites include an entire category devoted to amateur or reality porn. Of course, many risks accompany creating your own porno. Consider beforehand what medium will be used for the video or pictures. Digital might be more convenient and higher quality, but it also could be infinitely preserved (remember the debacle with celebrity nudes being snatched from the iCloud?). Using film may ensure that only you and those you grant permission get their hands on the evidence. If you are creating the film or photos with another person, communicate and create an agreement about what you are allowed to do with the tape. Talking is important. Discuss what the images will include. Obtain informed consent and tape that, too, especially if the following images are kinky. Keep the tape safe and have a plan just in case it needs to be destroyed or obtained from anyone else who has it in their possession.Once all the decisions about privacy and consent have been made, it’s time to set the scene. Ditch fluorescent lights for softer lighting. Consider using colored bulbs to change the look and feel of the images. The camera should be set on a tripod for stable shots. Shoot from above with the lens pointing down. Consider shooting from different angles to make the video more interesting. If you are with a partner and want a good face shot, you might want to remove the camera from the tripod and experiment with various perspectives. If you don’t want your face to show, carefully plan out the shot so that only bodies are visible. Consider what you are wearing for the shoot as well. Lingerie? Leather? Will you have a whip? Heels? If you are inviting a partner, what will they wear? Do you want to be waxed clean or au natural? Do you want to add music or let your moans create the soundtrack?Once the cameras begin to roll it may feel difficult to act natural. Pick out some moves beforehand to increase confidence. Editing might be necessary if you don’t want to include several minutes of re-applying lube. Work on transitions between positions to impress your audience (even if it’s just you).Above all, pornography should be fun to create and consume. If you don’t enjoy porn, that’s OK too! But always encourage yourself to explore your inner fantasies.Have sexy questions of your own you want answered? Send your inquires to mhead@wisc.edu.

Tony Evers. This comes a couple of weeks after a bipartisan group of Wisconsin legislators introduced a proposal to grant in-state tuition rates to any University of Wisconsin System school for all registered native tribal members members nationwide, and four months after the introduction of the “Our Shared Future” plaque on the UW campus.On the surface, it appears the university, its system and the state as a whole are all making dedicated progress to rectifying their tumultuous history with Wisconsin’s First Nations.Oh, if only it were that simple.To understand Wisconsin’s complex relationship with its twelve First Nations, one must turn their history book back to at least 10,000 B.C.E. These cultures have populated the land we now know as “Wisconsin” for thousands of years, yet by and large these cultures are now shreds of what they were prior to 1832.Of particular importance to UW is the Ho-Chunk Nation. At that time, “Teejop” was the spiritual and cultural center for the Ho-Chunk Nation, which was so closely tied to its spiritual culture that the name “Ho-Chunk” refers to the peoples’ sacred language.Native American students experience difficulty transitioning to campus, lack UW support
As of fall 2018, 575 students attending the University of Wisconsin identify as Native American, according to the Office of Read…Last month, tribal and federal Ho-Chunk lawyer Samantha Skenandore presented a lecture on the connection between UW and the ancient, sacred grounds it lies on. Skenandore’s talk highlighted the ways the university’s history continually overwrites that of the Ho-Chunk Nation, and how this pattern of “colonial domination” continues to this day. Skenandore urged members of the UW community to “absorb the energy” of the Ho-Chunk people embedded into the campus as one of the most effective pathways to understanding.A couple of days after Skenandore’s talk, I visited the mounds, or what’s left of them, on Observatory Hill. These two mounds appear to many as the lone survivors of what were likely once thousands in Dane County alone.The university prides itself on saving these sacred sites, but ignores the implicated erasure of Ho-Chunk heritage. In fact, the “Our Shared Future” plaque is carefully worded (it took ten drafts, after all) in such a way so the university is not tied to the ethnic and cultural cleansing of the Ho-Chunk Nation. By not accepting blame for literally occupying this space — by some accounts among the most sacred sites in North America — the university lessens the urgency of reparations on campus and neglects to apologize for its repeated abuse and neglect of Ho-Chunk culture.Of course, the university would like to say it is actively combating this with the four-pronged educational action plan introduced alongside the “Our Shared Future” plaque, specifically as it offers a Native history campus walking tour, programming in the Our Wisconsin experience for first-year students in university housing, in the new Public History Project and “in different ways across the curriculum.”Unless a student is a SOAR adviser or took a class specifically dealing with Native histories, it is unlikely they have gone on the walking tour. Why? Only one person on staff, the American Indian Curriculum Services coordinator, is currently assigned to lead these First Nations Cultural Landscape tours, and presenting these tours is just one of their many duties.Native American representation in medicine crucial to combating public health disparities, report suggests
Last summer, two Native American medical students approached Dr. Amy DeLong, a family physician and medical director at the Ho-Chunk Read…Given the estimated 45,319 students currently enrolled at UW, the inadequacy of this program’s size is evident, as it is impossible for one person, in addition to their other duties, to also educate the entire student body about these sacred lands.Secondly, using Our Wisconsin as a means of rectifying the university’s heritage is hardly encompassing. The 90 minute workshops required for all first-year residents in on-campus housing are designed to cover all facets of diversity and inclusion, including race, gender, sexual orientation and religion. Yes, in 90 minutes.Even with the intentional inclusion of Ho-Chunk heritage in this programming, Our Wisconsin misses graduate students, transfer students and freshmen living off-campus. These groups make up at least a third of the campus population.The Public History Project, born out of an April 2018 task force to address separate historical issues of racial intolerance at UW, is again equipped with addressing every narrative of oppression and suppression at the university. Yet again, only one staff member is charged with this entire project, and the vast majority of contributors to this project are history students using it as their capstone in the major.Since it is a mostly student-driven project for the time being, students chose the narratives which the project will explore. Through this, there is hope — not a guarantee — that Native histories and heritage will receive a greater place in the university’s memory.Native American historian discusses missing, murdered indigenous women
Heather Brugel, a Native American historian, activist and member of the Oneida Nation, discussed the growing issue of missing and Read…Disregarding the extremely vague “in different ways across the curriculum” point of the plan, it is evident that UW still isn’t doing enough to explore and mend the relationship with Ho-Chunk Nation.It would be easy to single out UW’s painful history and incomplete response as a outlier in a generally progressive historical movement, but inaction on confronting histories like these span across universities nationwide.At Georgetown, despite a majority vote last April to include a $27.20 reparations fund fee on top of tuition in order to benefit descendants of 272 enslaved people sold in 1838 to keep the university afloat, the Board of Regents has yet to dedicate such a fund. In 2017, Brown University only agreed to preserve Pokanoket lands the university purchased in the 1950s when the tribe staged a month-long occupation of the lands. These stories are just a few examples.At the dedication ceremony for the “Our Shared Future” plaque, Chancellor Blank said the plaque will “start a conversation that moves us from ignorance to awareness.” Almost 200 years after the university’s land was forcibly taken from its natives, just being aware of Ho-Chunk history is not enough.Angela Peterson (apeterson@badgerherald.com) is a senior studying history and music.

Austin Wellens, director of WUD Film, has been working to bring a big production of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” to campus — and it looks like he’s going to pull it off.Wellens has been collaborating with “Performing Arts,” the Union Theatre and Sex Out Loud to turn the “Rocky Horror” screening into a big event — and hopefully a tradition — on Halloween weekend.“I couldn’t be more excited about it, because we’ve got a shadow cast and we’ve got the big theatre, so we can actually make it a big event,” Wellens said.Those looking for some whacky, raunchy fun this Halloween weekend are encouraged to join Wellens and other members of the film committee at “The Rocky Horror” showing. He’ll be the one wearing a corset, fishnets, heels and tuxedo, he said.",WUD Film committee to bring socially conscious films to campus’ cinematic desert,UWM
https://badgerherald.com/artsetc/2006/09/28/hbo-film-leaves-view/,"Sep 28, 2006","Porn stars are no longer society's embarrassment. With the ""irrational exuberance"" of the '90s, they came forward as counter-cultural representatives of capitalism. And if my guess is right, they're not looking back.Underage adult film performer Tracy Lords and her movement into mainstream Hollywood (Jon Waters' ""Cry Baby"") would make an early mark in that statement, but the big exclamation goes out to reigning queen of porn Jenna Jameson, because, well, she's Jenna Jameson — the platinum standard. So it's not surprising that as the pornographic industry has dislodged itself from the gutter (from a guy, a girl and an 8 mm camera to big budgets and cable access), we find ourselves taking notice in new ways.""Thinking XXX"" is a provocative HBO documentary (Is there any studio more fresh with hits like ""The Wire"" and ""Entourage""?) about the making of a picture book (""XXX 30 Porn-Star Portraits"") whose place is more suitable on the coffee table than beneath the mattress. The premise: celebrity photographer Timothy Greenfield-Sanders photographs porn stars in repose — both clothed and, yes, unclothed. He astutely recognizes that ""porn stars [are] much more comfortable nude than they are clothed."" Interlace shots with pompous pontifications of renowned writers, musicians and filmmakers, and you have a highbrow approach to a lowbrow subject. Who would have thought the making of a book could be so fun and fascinating?But then again, when the subject is porn, the makers have a pretty strong hook. It's nice to see something come out of Hollywood that isn't a botch.Some of the biggest names in the adult industry come before the camera: Briana Banks, Savanna Samson, Chloe, Lexington Steele, Peter North, Jesse Jane, mega-star Jenna Jameson and everyone's favorite poke-fun-at-iconoclast Ron Jeremy. That in itself would be enough for most caught in a channel surfing moment, but the documentary adds a layer of depth when the stars talk candidly about their lives and choices — and the consequences.Surprisingly, there is no talk of abuse, regret or tear-filled sorrow. The X-rated stars and starlets come across as basically normal people — wanting more but feeling no less. There's a moment when Jesse Jane, lounging in her pool, looks up and grins at the camera and tells us how happy she is, and it's hard to believe she's not.Conversely, the dark humor sprinkled throughout the film is not ultra-shocking; cult film director Jon Waters acutely compares a condom-free scene in gay porn to watching ""a snuff film."" Performer Gina Lynn darts her eyes as her boyish husband draws near. She seems to be looking around for a divorce lawyer. Sean Michaels gives us his ""I'm an artist"" speech and then disappears into a lonely doorway. Writer Michael Musto explains how male porn stars used to be unattractive, and the camera cuts to fat and hairy veteran Ron Jeremy. Lukas Ridgeston strokes his bread and butter compulsively, as if he is afraid he's going to be caught with his pants down and belittled. Then there's the scrawny white kid who wants to get into gay porn. There's a cringe-inducing sense that he's going to get gangbanged and turned out.There are affecting moments, too. Star Heather Hunter tells how she goes on a date and really likes the guy. They have sex, only to have the guy reach over for a pen and pad and ask for an autograph. Tera Patrick is so beautiful, smart and witty that you wonder what she's thinking doing what she is doing. Then you see her husband and realize self-flagellation is a distinct possibility. Gay adult performer Chad Hunt explains how male performers can make five times the pay if they go the route of gay porn, suggesting he and others are actually heterosexual.Jenna Jameson is notably silent. Perhaps because she controls all her outputs, with her own studio, talent agency and website, ""Club Jenna,"" and a recent best-selling tell-all, ""How to Make Love like a Porn Star.""New York City resident Greenfield-Sanders keeps to the corners. Maybe that is to be expected, as he is not the focus of his camera. I think it is more indicative of the New York-Los Angeles divide. At the NYC premiere of his photos, we see guests adjusting their eyeglasses, looking subdued and thoughtful. The crowd at the LA premiere is there to party. It's a noisy bash with a bloated Mickey Rourke, who looks as if he is 24 hours out of a face-lift.But for all its fine points, the documentary lacks an arc, a moving story. We see stars but no constellation. I didn't feel educated; I felt I was given bits of trivia. It was sex without a happy ending — I had a good time, but I wanted to go to completion. Yet, the film still scores, if you enjoy it for what it is.So if you're looking for a party pleaser to play at the frat (or sorority), sans the hardcore, or if you're in a New York state of mind, you'll find ""Thinking XXX"" is an escape from the typical Hollywood drivel.",HBO film leaves viewers ‘Thinking XXX’,UWM
