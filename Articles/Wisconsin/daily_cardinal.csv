Madison Fire Department paramedics examined her at the scene.""The victim was able to get away from the suspect when she screamed as a car approached them, distracting the suspect just enough so she could run away,"" Madison Police Spokesman Joel DeSpain said in the release.The suspect was described as a possibly Hispanic male in his 20s, 5 feet, 7 inches tall, clean-shaven with a buzz cut haircut, wearing a black wool coat and dark jeans.In two attacks last July, victims reported similar attacks and gave comparable descriptions of their attacker.Early in the morning on July 1, a 22-year-old woman was attacked while walking alone near University Avenue. The suspect fled after a bicyclist approached the scene.Similarly, on July 2, a woman was walking home alone early in the morning when she was struck in the head. The victim was able to fight off her attacker, causing him to run. Police said the attack was most likely an attempted sexual assault.""There are similarities as far as the suspect's description and that the women were all walking alone,"" DeSpain told madison.com (http://bit.ly/sisIc0).Police are encouraging anyone with information about Wednesday's attack or the two in July to call Madison Area Crime Stoppers at (608) 266-6014.",Student allegedly attacked Downtown,UWM

The Dirty Bird, my regular column, is the sex column on Page 2. Sure, individual politics likely play a role in individual sexual choices, but I believe there should be little global overlap between the two realms; and let me assure you, I much prefer sex to politics.Unfortunately, the Wisconsin GOP continues to pursue the personal as political, intruding ever more blatantly into our individual bedrooms. We've already witnessed the attempted repeal of the Healthy Youth Act in favor of abstinence-based ""education,"" widely shown to be good for little except ignorance and hatemongering. Sen. Mary Lazich, R-New Berlin, and Rep. Michelle Litjens, R-Oshkosh, now offer up the Coercive and Webcam Abortion Prevention Action Act, which I don't think is actually a thing so much as a bunch of random words strung together. And the most poppable cherry on top of it all: Rep. Andre Jacque's, R-Bellevue, ""personhood amendment,"" granting ""personhood"" to fertilized eggs.Jacque says his bill is a ""declaration that our inalienable rights extend from the moment of conception,"" and ""every human being at any stage of development"" deserves such rights. Meanwhile, Lazich and Litjens' bill serves to ""save the lives of babies and protect the health of women."" Oh, how nice.I'm not going to explain why these bills will cost money and lives. Some of my fellow pro-choice, pro-women's health activists will do that ably and admirably, and I am truly thankful for their patient efforts.However, that kind of debate assumes the terms that have been set forth by Jacque and company are straightforward and authentic. They are neither.For the terms to be framed correctly, Jacque must come clean about the fact that the inclusion of Wisconsin women under ""every human being"" comes with fine print.He must stop hiding behind ""life!"" and ""babies!"" and ""rights!"" and admit that in his proposal ""inalienable"" rights are alienable depending on a ""person's"" uterine contents. Perhaps even potential uterine contents, given that the precise moment of fertilization is not ascertainable by any technology known to humankind.Litjens must explain that her bill says women are simply not smart enough or significant enough to make decisions about what should happen to our bodies and our lives.Lazich must tell her female constituents she thinks they cannot be trusted to make reproductive choices without government supervision.Personhood activists must stand up and say that no woman deserves happiness, liberty, or even life-even life-if those pursuits do not include fetal preservation at any cost.So-called pro-lifers must cop to the fact that ""every life is precious!"" really means ""life is only precious until it spreads its legs or gets itself raped, you whore, and now you're less of a person than the two cells that occupy your uterus.""These are the declarations these bills are really making. So, Jacque, Lazich and Litjens, stop misrepresenting the things you're asking us to support. Stop pretending women matter to you when our health and our lives will be collateral damage in the holy name of zygotes if your legislation should pass.Stop portraying yourselves as crusaders for human rights when the rights you seek to extend will permit you to deprive half the state of ours.Stop representing yourselves as noble protectors of human life and health when you and your most vocal supporters would slaughter BadgerCare, eliminate medically accurate health education from Wisconsin schools, shield pharmaceutical companies from lawsuits when their products cause deaths, allow people to carry loaded firearms without any training in their use and kill bills helping child abuse victims bring their molesters to justice.Stop acting as though you seek to rectify coercion and oppression when those are the underpinnings of your each and every word.Jacque is right about one thing: there are some human beings in our society who are not unconditionally considered persons worthy of rights. We are called women. And we are not fooled by the fraudulent terms set forth by proponents of these bills.The debate to be had here is not whether two-celled embryos deserve to enjoy ""personhood""-it's whether Wisconsin women do.Erica Andrist is a third-year medical student at UWSMPH.

Weeks after its initial surfacing, it is still a highly discussed issue on campus, especially with this Saturday’s upcoming matchup.When the Nittany Lions come to Madison this weekend, emotions are sure to run high. Per usual, we want to win, but we’re also playing a team recently led by some detestable people, a reality that stirs up strong emotions in most.  Around campus, I’ve heard students joke about chanting “Pedo State” come gameday. Others have discussed switching out the “asshole” chant with “rapist.” One student even proposed shouting, “You rape little boys! You rape little boys!”This is a great university filled with countless brilliant minds. We know better than to shout insensitive nonsense like this. When Penn State students rioted in the streets of State College, the rest of the country looked upon them with disgust and disbelief. That these people thought a man’s tarnished football career was a bigger injustice than the abuses committed against innocent children is ludicrous, and Nittany Lions fans proved themselves to be the same.Should we be angry? Absolutely—both as members of the Big Ten and as human beings. But we need to channel that anger into something proactive, not petty. If you feel so inclined, wear teal—the color of sexual assault awareness—to Saturday’s game. Donate money or get involved with foundations working to end child abuse. Forever think of Jerry Sandusky, Joe Paterno and the many others involved in the scandal as the cowards they are, but please do not stoop to PSU fans’ level.It’s no secret that Badger fans can be vulgar. Students in particular have come under fire this semester for the “ES-FU” chant. In my opinion, that tradition is nothing compared to how students have threatened to behave come Saturday. The heinous suggestions I’ve heard people make in the last couple of weeks are immature, inappropriate and will lead to the same kind of condemnation Penn State fans earned themselves.Be classy, Badgers. We are the better football team.

What happened at PSU and to the victims of Jerry Sandusky's crimes is despicable and calls into question what heinous actions (or lack thereof) people will take to preserve the reputation of an athletic program and its idols.But we cannot keep speaking in hypotheticals when all college campuses, especially our own, are dealing with horrific realities. The fact of the matter is 25 percent of the women on the UW-Madison campus will be victims of rape or attempted rape throughout their time at college. That number should disturb you-it should rock you to your core.There is no sense in comparing what happened to the boys sexually abused by Sandusky and ignored by PSU leaders to what is happening to victims on this campus. Traumatic experiences are not relative to one other: They are traumatic. End of story.I happen to be a good friend of Mr. Savidge and know him as someone who takes the issue of sexual assault very seriously. Still, if we are going to prompt the student body to think about this epidemic, we must do so in a way that is both thought provoking and productive.It's not that Mr. Savidge was ill intentioned. It's not that the question he asked was an unimportant one. It's that we cannot concentrate on a hypothetical when sexual assault exists as a reality on this campus.We need to translate the anger and disappointment we felt upon hearing of the Penn State scandal into something that truly benefits our campus and fellow Badgers affected by sexual assault.Sincerely,Jacqueline O'ReillyPAVE Media AdvocatePAVE is a student organization dedicated to ending sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking on the UW-Madison campus through education and activism.

Could a coach you idolize, the way Penn State fans worship at the altar of Joe Paterno, fail to act when society demands he should? Could the organization you give your life to, as a sports fan and (in the case of college athletics) as a person, betray your trust in such a sickening way?The troubling answer is that, yes, it could.This isn’t to say that something like the Penn State cover-up is happening somewhere else, but we’d be blind to think that it couldn’t. That’s just how major sports programs, whether collegiate or professional, work: They want to protect their own and defend the brand over any “outsider,” even if that outsider is a vulnerable child.It’s a point that has been made a lot since the scandal broke—institutions, sports and otherwise, collapse at the sight of danger, drawing inward to protect themselves when a problem arises. Self-preservation becomes the top priority, and conscience takes a back seat to loyalty.There’s no way we can say that the kind of cover-up and moral bankruptcy that was on display in Penn State couldn’t happen somewhere else, because there are institutions just like that athletic department in every aspect of our society, sports and otherwise. Corporations hide bad accounting and harmful practices just like college sports programs hide recruiting violations and misbehaving athletes. There’s no incentive for being up-front and honest about something negative, other than the fact that it could blow up in your face, as Penn State has found out.Rewind two weeks, before the whole world knew the name Jerry Sandusky, and ask if you could see any program turning in one of its own and admitting to something as horrible as what he allegedly did. Ask if a university would choose to bring that kind of shame upon itself for the sake of doing what’s right, rather than trying to cover it up and save the brand.Would Michigan do what we’re all saying Penn State should have done? Would Minnesota? Would Wisconsin?It’s not a pleasant thought, that the people we trust in our schools and our teams are capable of something like what we’ve seen happening in Penn State, but we have to confront the reality that Wisconsin is an institution like any other.We believe our school is different, but when you strip off the colors and the mascots and the fight songs, the Badgers and the University of Wisconsin are institutions just like Penn State. They have the same forces pulling them to protect the program and, other than the moral pull to do what’s right, have the same lack of incentive to actually fix what happened.Saying that what happened at Penn State could never happen at UW is like saying the scandals over recruiting violations and improper benefits at schools like Ohio State could never happen here. It takes either a foolish naivete about the nature of college athletics or a head buried deeply in the sand to honestly believe that this university is different from all the others.We want to think Wisconsin is an exception because it’s our home, because we gave our lives to it and we’d never be dumb enough to go somewhere that wasn’t righteous. And maybe it is. I’ve loved every minute of my time at this place, and I have a fierce loyalty to my university, but I realize that when it comes to high-level college athletics, Wisconsin is just another program. Like Ohio State and like Penn State, it’s capable of being flawed.The same thing could happen here. The only question is whether the people we trust are strong enough to do what’s right.How would Wisconsin react to a scandal like the one at Penn State?

In the case of certain problems facing the UW-Madison campus, the situation is no different.Sexual assault, dating violence and stalking are already issues plaguing this community, but ones that need to be addressed before the number of victims gets even higher. Currently, one in four women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape throughout her time at college. Ninety percent of these victims will experience sexual assault at the hands of someone they know. Additionally, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence estimates one in four women and one in nine men will be victims of domestic violence during their lifetime. Females 20-24 years of age are at the greatest risk of nonfatal intimate partner violence, and people age 18-24 experience the highest rates of stalking.While sexual assault, dating violence and stalking are issues facing all the varied demographics, each case is fueled by the same cause: perpetrators’ need for power and control. How the abuser aims to get the upper hand can vary from case to case, but coercion, intimidation, threats and isolation are tactics often utilized.While many cases of rape, dating violence and stalking have already happened over the years, countless have yet to unfold. As members of this community, it is necessary we educate ourselves about sexual assault and domestic violence and how they exist on the UW-Madison campus. That way, if we find ourselves in a situation where either ourselves or someone we know is dealing with rape or domestic violence, we know how to safely intervene and offer appropriate resources.Partnering with the UW School of Social Work, Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment (PAVE) offers Social Work 672: Contemporary Topics in Social Welfare PAVE. This two-credit, advanced-level course is facilitated by students for students, aiming to, like the proverb says, stop the problem before it starts.With PAVE Peer Education, students have the opportunity to be proactive when it comes to these very real issues. It can be easy to dismiss sexual assault, dating violence and stalking as problems you need not worry about if you have never personally experienced either. Statistics show, though, that it is impossible someone could remain completely unaffected. Even if you are unaware of it, everyone knows someone affected by sexual assault, dating violence and stalking.With this in mind, students are taught to facilitate workshops that educate the campus community on the issues of sexual assault, dating violence and stalking as well as address the stereotypes surrounding the crimes and what resources are available to those who experience them.With the right knowledge, students have the power to end injustice on campus. Sexual assault, dating violence and stalking are issues affecting far too many students. If, by educating themselves, students can take on the responsibility to make their community members aware, we many finally see violence numbers go down.PAVE is a student organization dedicated to ending sexual assault, dating violence and stalking on the UW-Madison campus through education and activism.",PAVE: Education vital to preventing domestic violence on campus,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/11/penn-state-scandal-violates-human-morality-and-law,"November 8, 2011 | 8:29pm CST","After a year of NCAA violations ripping through some of the nation’s preeminent college football programs, the latest scandal involving the Penn State football program takes the disgust over what happened at Ohio State and Miami to a completely different level. Penn State didn’t just violate NCAA bylaws (in fact, they probably didn’t violate those at all), they violated our nation’s laws and more importantly, the laws of human morality.It is troubling enough that a Division I defensive coordinator would use his position of power to allgedly take advantage of young boys and satisfy his pedophilic desires, but it is perhaps more troubling that those around the program would ignore this man’s transgressions in the hope of continuing to win football games.For nearly a decade.Yes, nearly 10 years passed from the time an unsuspecting graduate assistant first witnessed former Nittany Lion defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky sexually assaulting a young boy in the team’s shower area and reported his frightening observation to program superiors, specifically to head coach Joe Paterno.Over those ten years, Sandusky was able to walk the face of the earth in freedom, freedom to continue ruining the lives of young children whose traumatic experiences would no doubt haunt them for as long as they live.Why?Because allegations like this, concerning a person, Sandusky, tapped by many at one point to be the likely successor to the legendary Paterno, would spell disaster for the Nittany Lion program and would tarnish the legacy of the great JoePa.Because allegations like this would hurt recruiting and make it difficult for Penn State to continue fielding a team that could compete at the highest level on a national stage.Because allegations like this threatened to take Penn State back to the pre-Paterno days during which State College was simply a cloistered town in central Pennsylvania that just happened to house a state university.It is sickening just having to imagine how this thought process played itself out, how despite these allegations making their way to the desk of Penn State President Graham Spainer’s desk, the only result was Sandusky’s ban on use of PSU football facilities.No police report. No further investigation.Perhaps even more sickening is the reality that Penn State probably is not the only program in today’s landscape of college football that would choose the same path of immorality in order to save their program. College football has become too much of a money-maker, too much of a measuring stick of the viability of major research universities that despite the sickening nature of what went on, I do not think it is crazy to conclude that other programs out there would choose the same course of inaction.Football has become larger than life and that is a dangerous reality that we as Americans must reevaluate.It is sad that we have to hear comments such as “Well, Tuscaloosa was destroyed and people died, but at least Bryant-Denny Stadium was spared from damage.” And yes, I did not pull that out of thin air, someone actually said that on the set of “College Gameday” Saturday.It is sickening that despite the evidence showing how NFL players across the board are dying at a significantly younger age than the general population, it is more important that we keep the game hard-hitting and exciting.And it is sickening that a university would think for even a second to hide away the transgressions of one of its own in order to maintain the football program’s ability to recruit at a high level.What has happened at Penn State will forever tarnish one of the game’s great personalities in Joe Paterno. Whether or not Paterno is fired (which he should be, but likely won’t), JoePa will now be remembered for allowing this abuse to occur under his watch, perhaps even more so than for his Division 1-record 409 wins.But one can only hope that this incident gives rise to a national rethinking of the role football plays in our society. One can only hope that other programs don’t simply shrug this incident off as an isolated event because while the actual disgrace is confined to State College, the principles that led to it are prevalent throughout college athletics.Football is just a game. The spectacle with which games are conducted may seem to some as “larger than life,” but the reality is that nothing overshadows the importance of life itself.Nothing.Not even football.What is your take on the PSU scandal?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/11/freakfest-2011-trend-persists-arrests-down,"November 1, 2011 | 2:59am CDT"," Although police reported more arrests from Saturday night’s Freakfest on Monday, bringing the total to 32, statistics only confirmed that Freakfest 2011 was one of the most subdued Madison Halloween in recent memory.Police Department Public Information Officer Joel DeSpain said authorities were skeptical that arrest figures would decrease further from 2010’s total of 43, but the number of citations Saturday left officials surprised.“[The 32 arrests] really, I think, speaks volumes about how this event has really turned around,” said DeSpain.Before the rebranding of festivities in Madison as the officially-sanctioned Freakfest event in 2006, Halloween celebrations in Madison were often punctuated by rioting, looting and police using tear gas across State Street—most recently in 2005.The 2011 event was a far cry from that. The 32 arrests made Saturday night, 25 offenders were cited and released, while 4 were sent to jail. The incident report listed 3 people as being sent to either the hospital or a detoxification center.Revised citation figures put the total number of Freakfest citations at 46. According to DeSpain, citations can surpass the number of arrests made, as individuals can be issued more than one citation.“Our arrests were behavior-based. It really has to do with how people are conducting themselves on the street,” DeSpain said. “The majority of people were arrested for underage drinking or open intoxicants.”Along with the number of reported incidents, DeSpain said the kind of the quality of these violations was also indicative of Saturday’s relatively tame festivities.

They start up what appears to be a conversation familiar to them. Dawn: """"But now here you are [Jenna], married to this handsome guy … who's got very good hair, and pregnant with a little girl. But neither of us would trade places with you for one second, now would we Becky?""""Becky: """"No we wouldn't, Dawn, No we wouldn't.""""As the offending, attractive-haired husband in question, Earl, tears into the parking lot to pick up Jenna, the nature of the waitresses' conversation becomes clear: Earl is a controlling jerk.Earl speaks in a threatening tone and reacts with satisfaction when Jenna gives in to his every command. As he proceeds to collect all of Jenna's tips from the day and threatens to make her leave her job, the viewer gets the uncomfortable feeling that Jenna is walking on egg shells with her every move around Earl.The film, """"Waitress,"""" depicts between 600,000 and 6 million women's realities in the United States per year. This number doesn't take into the account the number of men who experience the same violence and control. While women do make up the majority of domestic violence victim, 15 percent of those affected are male.The myth that only physical abuse can be considered domestic violence saturates the media. Films and television shows typically show cases of murders or extreme physical attacks. This is an important and very real occurrence in the world. The Domestic Violence Resource Center states, """"On average, more than three women and one man are murdered by their intimate partners in this country every day."""" However, a typical case can be much more subtle and complex.As demonstrated in """"Waitress,"""" domestic abuse includes much more than physical abuse; intimidation, isolation, emotional and financial abuse are all common weapons perpetrators use to control their victim. Perpetrators can lower the victim's self-esteem, restrict the victim from seeing or speaking with friends and family, and control their access to finances.These all serve to keep the victim under their control and create major barriers that keep them from leaving. It is important to recognize that these behaviors are just as serious and abusive as physical attacks and are often more difficult to detect.With young people comprising almost half of domestic violence cases, it's important to remember these myths when observing relationships in our daily lives. Whether for our personal relationships or those of our friends and family, it is necessary to keep an eye out for these traits. They are neither excusable nor normal; they are indicative of a violent relationship and must be taken seriously.Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment (PAVE) is a student organization dedicated to ending sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking on the UW-Madison campus through education and activism.

Rich Zipperer, R-Pewaukee who supports the passing of the bill, said, """"Taxpayers are going to be forced to subsidize abortion"""" if states had been allowed to fund abortions through federal exchanges.Wisconsin Right to Life, the largest pro-life organization in the state, also supports the bill.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/10/help-exists-for-domestic-abuse-victims,"October 3, 2011 | 1:00am CDT","When most people think of October, they picture falling leaves, football games and wrapping themselves up in layers before heading to class. However, October has a significant meaning for Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment (PAVE), a student organization on campus.October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month (DVAM), a nationally recognized time of observance and action. This year, PAVE is taking a stand for the UW-Madison, creating awareness about domestic violence's existence on campus.Domestic violence is an ongoing pattern of behavior in a relationship where one person exerts power and control over another. This includes physical, emotional, verbal or sexual abuse. As such, no one, regardless of sex, gender, race or sexual orientation is immune to the realities of domestic violence.Some people may think, """"Really, it exists on campus? Doesn't it take place in the movies with someone who everyone knows is bad? Surely it can't happen to me. I'm too smart to put myself in that situation, right?""""Unfortunately, domestic violence exists in Wisconsin; it even exists here on campus. From national statistics published by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV), one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime, and females ages 20-24 are at the highest risk of non-fatal domestic violence.That means our fellow Badgers, the people we attend class with, """"Jump Around"""" with and party with on the weekends, are often survivors of domestic violence or currently in an abusive relationship.When it comes to domestic violence, there is often no physical evidence of wrongdoing. It is easy to cover up bruises with long sleeves, and emotional abuse doesn't leave any plainly visible scars. But it is impossible for victims to erase the memories and effects of domestic violence.According to research conducted by the Domestic Violence and Mental Health Policy Initiative, victims of domestic violence are more likely to have sexual difficulties and eating disorders. Victims are also more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder and are at a significant risk of suicide.These are the issues plaguing student victims on campus, day in and day out. Try adding the challenges of PTSD on top of worrying about financial aid, getting good grades and the rest of college-imposed stresses.Conversely, think about how difficult it can seem to rid yourself of your largest support system. It may not make sense to you, but that's what it feels like to victims when they break it off with an abusive partner. It's a situation of constant worry, and it is something that people all over campus experience.Domestic violence knows no bounds. It is not limited to a specific gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, mental capacity, physical capabilities, etc. It could happen to someone with a 4.0 GPA or someone on academic probation. Unfortunately, it could happen to anyone.Some of the signs of an abusive partner may be: controlling behaviors, not allowing you to see friends, threatening to harm you or themselves based on your actions, telling you things to put you down or treating you as a sexual object. This list is not at all exhaustive, but demonstrates the different facets of domestic violence.Because any one of us could be at risk of being in an abusive relationship, it is important to know that there is help. You can get out of it, even though it may seem impossible. The Madison community and our university offer plenty of outlets for assistance. It is OK to ask for help. You are not weak for reaching out. In fact, it is one of the strongest things you can do.Yesterday marks the 30th anniversary of the National Day of Unity, a day started by the NCADV to bring advocates against domestic violence together. The day of awareness was turned into an entire month, and that is why DVAM is now observed throughout  October.PAVE is observing DVAM in East Campus Mall from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today to encourage students to sign pledges in support of healthy relationships and the victims of domestic violence. Please come out and show your support for your fellow students, community members and friends.If you believe you are in an abusive relationship, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-723 for assistance. Locally, you can call the Dane County Rape Crisis Center's rape hotline at  608-251-7273 or Madison's Domestic Abuse Intervention Service's hotline at 608-251-4445.Tomissa Porath wrote this article and is a PAVE media volunteer.PAVE is a student organization dedicated to ending sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus through education and activism.

Mike Verveer, District 4, cautioned in September against using it.""""Although convenient for folks to get around,"""" Verveer said, """"these days people shouldn't be using the bike path alone after dark.""""According to Berquam, the bike path's location makes it easy for muggers to attack their victims and make a quick getaway.Berquam said she's very proud of the campus's student organizations for encouraging people to make safe choices, such as walking in a well-lit area with a small group.Still, she said students on campus sometimes underestimate how dangerous the campus is in comparison with their hometowns.""""Living in an urban community means that you might do things differently than you would have done at home,"""" she said.","Campus safety report finds more sexual assults, fewer burglaries",UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/09/students-must-act-to-prevent-sexual-assault,"September 7, 2011 | 1:00am CDT","Last week, thousands of freshmen descended onto the UW-Madison campus.  Eager to start the next chapter of their lives, most are delightfully overwhelmed with everything this tremendous university has to offer. Most are also undereducated about a reality plaguing this campus: Sexual assault. Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment (PAVE) continually finds that the majority of students come to UW-Madison believing rape is something that only happens in the middle of the night when no one is around. As we've seen far too many times this summer, this form of rape certainly happens and needs to be addressed, but there is another reality students need to be aware of: One in four women will be victims of rape or attempted rape during their time at college. Ninety percent of these assaults will be perpetrated by someone the victim knows. While these numbers are staggering, most students remain confused about the scenario in which sexual assaults most commonly occur.   Knowing this dangerous misconception exists, it should be the university administration's responsibility to inform all, but especially new students, of these undeniable realities. Currently, the university invites freshmen to participate in a sexual assault prevention program, one that has proven effective. Pre-tests show that most students start the program ill informed about the definitions, realities and dynamics of sexual assault, but, based on their post-test scores, leave with a better, more comprehensive understanding. Still, only 13 percent of students completed the workshop in the fall of 2010, while 27 percent had partial completion and 60 percent did nothing at all. Because the program is not mandatory, there is no way to ensure students will take the initiative and complete it. However, 80 percent of those who completed either all or a portion of the program felt it was important for colleges to provide a sexual assault prevention program to its students, this compared to 49 percent of the population who did not complete any of the program. This gap suggests that once students are taught about the realities of sexual assault, they realize how severe of an issue it is and how important it is for students to be educated about the topic. One gentleman who completed the program said, """"It helped me understand how I can help stop sexual assault from happening to people around me. Even if I'm not involved in it, I can help stop it."""" This is an incredibly powerful take-away. If every student had this attitude, the impact would be profound and felt around campus. Yet, because the university does not enforce this program, the potential for change is lost. That said, we cannot simply point our fingers at the university administration and expect them to rid this community of rape. Is there more they could be doing? Absolutely, but we cannot expect anyone else to take action against rape until the majority of students step up and actively recognize it as a serious problem on campus. Passive disdain for sexual assault is not sufficient. We need to use our collective voice to say we will not let our campus be a place where rape is prevalent. We will not let our institutional leaders or peers turn a blind eye when something tragic happens. And, most of all, we will not let ourselves remain idle when offered the opportunity to make a difference and learn. Doing this not only means holding perpetrators accountable, but also breaking down the existent rape culture. We need to remember that alcohol is not a gateway to consent. We need to stop blaming rape victims for what they were wearing, how much they were drinking or how promiscuous they are, but instead blame the rapists for not getting consent. Most of all, we need to remember that consent is a freely given ‘yes,' not the absence of a ‘no.'  Rape would occur far less frequently on campus if this simple distinction was recognized by all. Sexuality may be a private issue, but sexual assault is a community problem. We all must work together to stop it. PAVE is a student organization dedicated to ending sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus through education and activism.  PAVE's kickoff meeting will be held at 7 p.m. on Sept. 15 in the PAVE office, room #3147 of the Student Activity Center.

Budget repair bill puts spotlight on WisconsinIt is not often that Madison is thrust into the national spotlight. However, when Gov. Scott Walker introduced his plan to cut collective bargaining rights for public employees in February, he set off a movement that brought the state government to a standstill for more than a month, making our state capital the political crucible of the nation.Supporters of the bill said it was necessary to balance the state budget, but the opposition claimed it was union busting and came out in force.What followed Walker's announcement was nothing if not cinematic. Increasingly more protesters filled the Capitol in the week following the bill's announcement until tens of thousands staged a full out occupation lasting a total of 18 days until the last hold-outs were ordered to leave.Signs decrying the new governor wallpapered nearly every surface inside the Capitol, drumming and chants continued through the night long after the lawmakers went home and demonstrators set up an infrastructure including food stations, a day-care center and even a small library to sustain the protest.The scene inside the chambers was no less dramatic than what was going on outside of them. Legislators split down party lines fought bitterly on the floor, and on February 20 the 14 Democratic state senators fled to Illinois where they would stay for three weeks to deny Senate Republicans the quorum they needed to vote on the bill.Although the """"Fab 14"""" became as controversial as the bill itself, they succeeded in delaying it for a few weeks. However, on May 9 Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald found a way around the quorum issue by stripping the fiscal components from the bill.However, a Dane County Judge found that Fitzgerald and the others involved broke the open meetings laws in order to pass it, and it is currently being held up in court.Though the provisions have already passed and the protests have subsided, this event marked a turning point for Wisconsin and the state will be feeling the effects of it for a long time to come. Nine senators are now facing recall elections this summer because of the stances they took during the Capitol crisis and a potential recall for Walker looms on the horizon.This was not just the biggest story for the campus or the state, but for a full month, the whole nation, and UW-Madison was in the center of it all.—Ariel Shaprio2. New Badger Partnership leaves UW at a crossroadsMore than 40 years after the creation of the UW system, controversy erupted as Chancellor Biddy Martin proposed the New Badger Partnership, a plan to remove UW-Madison from the UW system.The NBP would give UW-Madison a separate 21-member board of trustees, which would give the university authority in spending decisions as they face harsh budget cuts in 2011-'13.Martin said the NBP would be a crucial milestone for UW-Madison that would allow the university to remain competitive globally.Meanwhile, opposition grew among the other UW system chancellors who say the NBP would hurt higher education in Wisconsin by creating unnecessary competition between UW-Madison and the other UW system schools. Some students and faculty at UW-Madison oppose the partnership because they fear it will lead to privatization and tuition increases at the university.As controversy intensified and protest broke out on campus, Martin caught a break when the UW-Madison Faculty Senate passed a motion stating their official support of the NBP.The NBP could change UW-Madison drastically and will continue to be a topic of interest and debate around Wisconsin in the following months and maybe years.—Alex DiTullio3. Soglin re-upsPaul Soglin was sworn in as Madison mayor for the third time in April after defeating incumbent Dave Cieslewicz. The race for mayor was a close call with Soglin edging out Cieslewicz by 700 votes.Soglin surprised Cieslewicz when he announced his candidacy for mayor in December. In the February primary, Soglin also gained more votes than Cieslewicz by a narrow margin.Cieslewicz previously beat Soglin for mayor in 2003. Soglin served as mayor from 1973 to 1979 and again from 1989 to 1997. Soglin has held the mayoral position for more years than anyone else.—Maggie DeGroot4. 16 state Senators eligible for recallProtesters who had been demonstrating at the Capitol turned to recall campaigns after the state legislature passed the budget repair bill early March.Organizers from across the state campaigned against the 16 state Senators eligible for recall. Those against Republican senators have argued the process in which they passed the bill reflected the lack of transparency within the state government. Those collecting signatures to recall Democrat senators have argued it was unconstitutional for them to flee the state.Sen. Dan Kapanke, R- La Crosse, was the first to have a recall petition filed against him, followed by Sen. Randy Hopper, R-Fond du Lac after it was discovered he was having an affair with a legislative aid and living outside of his district.Recall campaigns have also turned in petitions against Sen. Sheila Harsdorf, R-River Falls, Sen. Luther Olsen, R-Ripon, Sen. Jim Holperin, D-Conover, Sen. Dave Hansen, D-Green Bay, Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, Sen. Robert Cowles, R- Green Bay, and Sen. Robert Wirch, D-Pleasant Prairie.Never before in Wisconsin history have nine senators simultaneously been forced to hold a recall elections.Recall elections will take place in July.—Samy Moskol5. Result still unclear in Supreme Court raceAfter finishing 30 percentage points behind David Prosser in the Supreme Court primary, it appeared as if JoAnne Kloppenburg did not stand a chance against heavily the favored incumbent in the general election.Seven weeks later, the two found themselves in the most contentious and partisan Supreme Court race in recent years.The race soon became a referendum on Gov. Scott Walker's agenda after the uproar over the budget repair bill. Despite promises from both to be independent, liberals and union backers supported Kloppenburg while conservatives and Walker supporters sided with Prosser.This enthusiasm from both sides resulted in a dramatic election night, with just a few hundred votes separating the candidates for most of the night. After a clerical error was discovered several days later, Prosser was declared the winner by just over 7,000 votes, with a recount currently underway.No matter the final result, it is clear there is a sharp political divide in Wisconsin and that the state will be a battleground in the 2012 election.—Adam Wollner  6. Mifflin in dangerThe Mifflin Street Block Party began in 1969 as an outlet for UW-Madison student activism; however, the future of the event is question following two stabbing incidents at this year's party. These violent acts, including the increasing number of intoxicated attendees, could end the historic block party.A 21-year-old UW-Madison student suffered life threatening injuries after being stabbed multiple times. A second stabbing occurred later that day when another victim sustained non-life threatening injuries.Mayor Paul Soglin and other city officials have spoken about the possibility of changing the block party or even ending it after the acts of violence and high levels of intoxication of attendees.  —Maggie DeGroot7. New Union South opensAfter months of construction and anticipation, the eco-friendly Union South opened its doors to the public April 15 with all-night bowling and a concert featuring the indie-glamrock band, of Montreal.The building includes entertainment such as a rock-climbing wall, a 350-seat movie theater, a bowling alley and a concert hall.The union makes available various food options such New York style pizza, Chinese food and UW-Madison's famous Babcock Ice Cream.As if exquisite design was not enough, the Union South is the first Leadership Energy and Environmental Design building on campus and is set to receive a gold rating.  It used 88 percent of the materials from the former Union South building, as well as panels from the old Kohl Center floor.—Alex DiTullio 8. ASM passes controversial fundAfter heated debate last fall, the Associated Students of Madison passed the controversial Campus Services Fund near the end of this semester in a last-minute vote.The CSF is an ASM funding stream that would guarantee financing to services student council deems vital, such as legal, tutoring and sexual assault services.The proposal was """"indefinitely postponed,"""" then relegated to Rules Committee after around 100 students spoke in opposition to the CSF during ASM open forum last December.When the spring semester began, the CSF, brainchild of Student Services Finance Committee Chair Matt Manes, seemed all but dead. However, Manes reintroduced the CSF to council near the end of this semester.The second vote on the CSF initially failed. But as the meeting drew to a close, Rep. Matt Beemsterboer motioned to reconsider the vote.Student council members re-voted, and finally passed the CSF.—Alison Bauter9. Palin pays visit to MadisonFormer vice presidential candidate and conservative superstar Sarah Palin appeared at a Madison Tea Party Rally in April supporting Gov. Scott Walker and sparked a mass protest against her visit.  The dueling rallies gave protesters the chance to see their counterparts up close, but resulted in little bipartisan agreement.Few were swayed by the others' witty signs and slogans; others just wanted fresh produce from the farmer's market.Palin praised Walker for fixing the budget and saving public-sector jobs, while reprimanding union leaders for hurting the people they represent.Never missing a chance to fuel rumors of a 2012 run, she told supporters to """"let the 2012 election begin here."""" She applauded Obama for building """"solar shingles and really fast trains [that] will magically save us"""" and invited both parties on the """"bullet train to bankruptcy.""""—Patrick Tricker10. Resnick snags District 8 seatRecent UW-Madison graduate Scott Resnick beat out UW-Madison student Kyle Szarzynski for the District 8 seat on Madison's city council.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/05/asm-sets-bar-high-for-next-year,"May 2, 2011 | 1:00am CDT","Until recently, the Associated Students of Madison's bafflingly unorganized, unaccountable and bureaucratic funding system could justifiably be compared to a wild game of Monopoly with student segregated fees. This year, however, we were pleased to see ASM make some refreshing and efficient changes when it came to getting things done.The progress made by the Legislative Affairs Committee, headed by sophomore Sam Polstein, was ASM's true success story this year. In the fall, the committee hosted the first annual Student Housing Fair, which attracted hundreds of students and gave them the opportunity to talk to various landlords face-to-face. Legislative Affairs also helped put together a gubernatorial debate and partnered with The Daily Cardinal to sponsor a well-attended debate between the State Assembly District 77 candidates. Most recently, the committee lobbied against the Voter ID bill at the state Capitol and put serious effort in making the negative effects of the legislation more visible to students. The Student Services Finance Committee also proved it is serious about reform. By the end of the session, ASM passed the Campus Services Fund, a plan proposed by SSFC Chair Matt Manes, that would ensure funding for legal, tutoring and sexual assault support services—vital programs that deserve recognition and continued support from ASM. Manes also impressed us when he held town halls with students to discuss SSFC's funding streams and distributed an incentive-based student survey to gauge support for the CSF.It is clear ASM is no longer paralyzed at delivering results. We were excited to see ASM support the New Badger Partnership and back the addition of a second student seat on the Board of Trustees. With this, it is safe to say Student Council has made strides to improve student involvement and campus outreach, as the council recently implemented a live feed of their meetings while individual members have consistently live blogged and tweeted updates from SSFC and Student Judiciary hearings. That's not to say we've been impressed with every move Student Council made this year. By the beginning of spring semester the Diversity Committee had functionally capsized under former chair Martín Uraga's direction. Diversity on campus was a particularly touchy issue this year—with the Holocaust denial ad controversy bookending last school year's diversity debate and the failed """"diversity"""" photo shoot beginning this year's conversation, the Diversity Committee had an opportunity to foster a much-needed, campus-wide discussion on tolerance and respect. Instead, Uraga failed to set agendas for the committee, rarely showed up to Student Council meetings and ended up resigning after his first semester as chair. A series of shady decisions made by a set of heady ASM leaders also cast a shadow of embarrassment on a number of individual members' tenure. After a few members were connected to a shadow registered student organization known as Associated Free Thinkers Ensuring Responsibility (AFTER) it became clear that some ASM leaders were using their power to sidestep Student Council bylaws.  Despite these setbacks, ASM made significant steps to build itself up as a relevant body in campus affairs. However, the newly elected ASM members who will carry out and test a number of this year's proposals could not be more different from the old guard that has controlled Student Council for years. The fresh faces—many of whom are affiliated with GSSF groups SSFC has worked to defund—bring a different ideology and set of priorities. We hope the new members don't let their ideas for change become divisive or get in the way of this year's successes. If nothing else, we hope next year's session takes substantive measures to fix the obnoxiously dated relic they call ASM's website.",ASM sets bar high for next year,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/04/what-does-sti-awareness-mean,"April 28, 2011 | 1:00am CDT","April is a sexually exhausting month. I hope you've had the chance to enjoy some of the important and inspiring events that have gone on for Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Out and About Month, National Day of Silence, Break the Silence Wisconsin and Sexual Health Week. And before April comes to a close, I want to plug one more event that's near and dear to my heart: STD Awareness Month.The Centers for Disease Control describes STD Awareness Month as """"an annual observance to raise awareness about the impact of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) on the health of Americans and the importance of individuals discussing sexual health with their healthcare providers and, if sexually active, their partners.""""The individual and public health impacts of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and STDs are pretty significant. There's really no difference between the terms """"STD"""" and """"STI""""—personally, I prefer the """"infection"""" phrasing, since most of them are caused by specific pathogens and are easily cured or treated, and are not chronic conditions that disrupt normal functioning. But there's really no difference other than terminology.At any rate, according to the CDC, the U.S. spends around $13 billion every year on the diagnosis and treatment of STIs. Nearly two million cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea were diagnosed in 2009. Up to 15 percent of women who do not receive chlamydia treatment will develop pelvic inflammatory disease, which can lead to chronic pelvic pain or infertility.Blah, blah, blah. While the real and potential health impacts of STIs can't be overstated, a pile of big numbers and scary facts isn't that helpful for most of us. So what does it really mean to be """"aware"""" this STD Awareness Month?Awareness means knowing our own STI status. One in six Americans has genital herpes, according to the CDC—but most (up to 90 percent) don't know they have it. Check yourself and get checked. Get to know your down-theres so you can tell if any new lumps or bumps crop up. Free urine screenings for chlamydia and gonorrhea are available at University Health Services. Vaginal pap smears can be obtained for HPV screening. Regardless of one's risk factors, the CDC recommends routine HIV screening for all adults, and blood testing is free for students at UHS.Awareness means knowing our partner's STI status. While most of us know asking about STIs is a healthy, responsible thing to do, it can still feel awkward, invasive, accusatory or just plain unsexy. Ask anyway, and try to do it confidently and with a smile. To paraphrase Charles Swindoll, I believe that STI conversations are 10 percent what comes out of your mouth and 90 percent how it comes out of your mouth. And if a potential partner wigs out, it's probably best not to have sex with them anyway.Awareness means knowing how STIs are spread. Not all STIs are created equal. If we know the most common routes of transmission for the most common STIs here on campus (HPV, chlamydia and herpes; skin-to-skin contact, genital secretions and skin-to-skin contact, respectively) then we can have a better idea of what our risks are and how we can minimize them.Awareness means knowing ways to protect ourselves and our partners from STIs and their sequelae. While many STIs are curable and all are treatable, they are also preventable. It's important to think about what methods of prevention will work best for us.Perhaps we don't have sex, or we only have sex with one person, or we only engage in certain sexual activities. Perhaps we use condoms, sex dams or other barriers that we can get for free from many campus orgs like Sex Out Loud, the LGBT Campus Center, PAVE or the Campus Women's Center.Perhaps we get vaccinated for things like HPV or hepatitis. Perhaps we get tested regularly and obtain expedited partner therapy (EPT) for our partners if we test positive. EPT has been legal in Wisconsin since last year, and it allows physicians to give two antibiotic prescriptions to a person who tests positive for chlamydia, gonorrhea or trichomoniasis: One for the person who tests positive, and one for that person to give to their partner.Awareness means knowing it's OK not to have all the answers. Despite the abundance of resources on campus, misinformation—much of it hateful—about STIs is everywhere. If we don't know, or if we think we know but we're not quite sure, it's important to ask. UHS and Planned Parenthood are just a phone call away. The CDC has a fantastic, easily accessible website detailing facts and statistics on STIs. Other helpful websites include Go Ask Alice!, Scarleteen and RHReality Check. And of course, you can always drop me a line at sex@dailycardinal.com.",What does STI awareness mean?,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/04/sexual-assault-report-numbers-vary-at-uw,"April 25, 2011 | 1:00am CDT","When she was sexually assaulted in a UW-Madison dorm last year, there were three other students present.Then a first-semester freshman at UW-Madison, she had come to visit her boyfriend who lived in the room where the assault took place. The perpetrator, a friend of her boyfriend, cornered her, touching her """"where he shouldn't have.""""The assault lasted about 20 minutes, she said, until one of the other students in the room intervened.""""It wasn't like things just happened quick,"""" she said. """"There was time for everyone to react.""""The victim, who asked to remain anonymous, told her father and roommate three days after the initial incident. The two convinced her to report the assault to the UW Police Department that night.Her story is not uncommon on college campuses.According to a 2000 study by the U.S. Department of Justice titled """"The Sexual Victimization of College Women,"""" on a campus with 10,000 female students, 350 of those women could experience a sexual assault each year. UW-Madison's student population hovers around 40,000 and women constitute slightly more than half of that number, according to UW-Madison's Data Digest.But fewer than 5 percent of victimization incidents are reported to law enforcement, the study said.Victims often do not report the crime for a number of reasons, according to the study. Some victims believe their assault is not serious enough. Other reasons include fears that the police will not believe their story, or will punish them for underage drinking, or that there will be repercussions from their assailant.According to Tonya Schmidt, an assistant dean in the Division of Student Life, in practice, the UW and Madison Police Departments do not issue underage drinking tickets to sexual assault victims.""""If something like that happened, [the Division of Student Life] would be all over it, calling and saying that ‘you cannot do this. We highly advise you to take the ticket away, this person has been a victim of an assault,'"""" she said. """"But we've never had to do that.""""However, even with a low number of reports relative to the frequency of the crime, the actual number of sexual assaults varies by source.The federal Clery Act requires UW-Madison and all universities receiving any federal funding for student aid to report crime statistics—including the number of sexual assaults—each year. The UW Campus Safety Guide, published annually by the university, includes these statistics.According to this source, there were 17 sexual assaults on the UW-Madison campus in 2009, the most recent data available.However, according to Kathy Kruse, an assistant dean in the Division of Student Life, this number is not representative of how many assaults take place within the UW-Madison community.""""Sophomores, juniors and seniors live off campus, so [the Campus Safety Guide represents] such a small piece of the campus,"""" Kruse said.The University of Wisconsin System report lists the numbers from the Offices of the Dean of Students.""""The UW System report wants to know everything, wherever it happened and they have different categories to make sure everything is encompassed in that,"""" Schmidt said.The UW System report details sexual assaults according to """"acquaintances,"""" """"not acquaintances"""" and """"unknown"""" categories.Every report from the Offices from the Dean of Students—from those that happened on or around campus to the sexual assaults on a spring break vacation—are included, according to Schmidt. This accounts for part of the 112 reports of sexual assault the Dean of Students Office received in 2010. The number was 45 in 2009.Schmidt attributes the increase primarily to efforts to increase awareness by End Violence on Campus, an initiative at UW-Madison sponsored by a three-year federal grant. Part of University Health Services, EVOC focuses on educating both students and faculty about the resources available for victims and about how to respond when a victim comes forward.Because each of these reports takes different information into account, it is difficult to compare the numbers.But ultimately, according to Schmidt, helping as many victims as possible is more important than the statistics.""""We are getting more people who are coming in and accessing resources and that is going to make them be able to heal a lot more effectively,"""" she said. """"They're going to be heard. People are going to say they believe them and that's going to be way better for their healing process."""" ",Sexual assault report numbers vary at UW,UWM

The poem described images of sexual assault victims without tongues finding their voices and moving through stages of shame and rage to awakening and empowerment.Connell emphasized the importance individuals have in creating the world they share.""""I feel blessed as a poet simply to create a work that reminds us that we are all connected, and reminds us about the responsibility we have to each other as a community, as a family, to take care of each other, to listen to each other, to respect each other,"""" Connell said.According to Connell and Rice, the move from depicting a person as a victim to a survivor begins by talking, opening up and getting rid of any taboo  associated with sexual assault.Rice, who was sexually assaulted by her daycare provider and her father, said it is important to believe every survivor and to treat them with respect.She said by speaking at events she now hopes to help people and create fulfillment in their lives and her own.Rice said she is proud to speak about her past rather than keep quiet. According to Rice, if she is able to help one person in the audience realize they are in an abusive relationship and empower that person to do something about it, then everything is worth it.""""You are only a victim if you look at yourself as a victim,"""" Rice said. """"You are not a result of the things that happened to you in your life; you are a result of how you react to those things.""""Rice said she considers her opportunity to share her stories of sexual assault on national television through the filming of """"The Real World"""" one of the things she is most blessed with in life.""""You really can turn that horrible [experience] to the thing that makes you the strongest person you could possibly be,"""" Rice said.","'Real World' star, poet speak on sexual assault",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/04/helping-victims-through-tragedy,"April 18, 2011 | 1:00am CDT","The issue of sexual assault and the challenges victims face are often discussed, but the role of those who assist them tends to go unnoticed.Nurses and victim advocates combine efforts to provide safety and services for sexual assault victims while educating the public about the issue. But this only scratches the surface of what Madison's Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners and Rape Crisis Center advocates confront every day.When the RCC receives a phone call from a victim, its advocates accompany them to the hospital. And when the victim reaches Meriter Hospital, a SANE nurse offers a medical exam and together they determine the victim's medical care plan.SANE nurses and RCC advocates balance compassion for victims with the professionalism necessary to do their jobs well, according to Meriter Hospital SANE coordinator Kim Curran.No matter how much training the nurses and advocates receive, each case requires an individualized approach.""""Even the highest trained advocates can't prepare [for] … being present with parents whose two-year-old is getting a sexual assault exam because they've been molested,"""" RCC executive director Kelly Anderson said.At the same time, Anderson said it is imperative that advocates maintain their professionalism.""""You're not any good by joining them in their pain,"""" Anderson said.According to Curran, the stress that accompanies this work can become overwhelming at times.To alleviate that stress, nurses and advocates may choose to attend monthly meetings in which they share testimonies and thoughts to remind each other that no one is alone.""""Some nurses journal and write out their emotions on paper,"""" Curran said. """"When I need to de-stress, I exercise and make sure I have a day off every now and then.""""The SANE nurses at Meriter Hospital are available 24 hours a day to help victims understand their options.Reporting to law enforcement and seeking a medical exam are among victims' choices, and victims ultimately decide whether to receive medical attention.""""I always encourage victims to have an exam for their own well-being, however not all victims want an exam,"""" Curran said. """"It's their right as an individual to refuse it.""""Although the nurses at Meriter and the advocates at the RCC are a large part of the victims' journeys in coping, their work has a greater focus as well, according to Anderson.""""When you get over 385 people [coming] in and all you do is take phone calls, it gets disheartening over time,"""" Anderson said. """"It's important to know and feel in our soul that we're a part of … a broader movement that's not just providing services, but also creating change.""""If it wasn't we would burn out a lot faster.""""The nurses and advocates use these pieces of reality to build solutions not just for the victims, but also for community members who they encouraged to participate.The RCC offers resources for both relief and community education through its offices on Coho Street on Madison's south side and the UW-Madison campus. Resources include self-defense classes, volunteer opportunities and its Imagine program, which helps increase awareness of sexual assault among high school students.Ultimately, Anderson said, through it all, the Rape Crisis Center will continue to provide services.""""Rape Crisis Center has been here since 1973,"""" Anderson said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/04/in-defense-of-porn,"April 15, 2011 | 1:00am CDT","The advice given [last week] to the [person] disgusted by [their] partner's pornography collection was the most ignorant, ill-informed bit of guidance I have ever seen. Ever.  Even if the collection was not illegal, if it was material that is degrading, such as [example of material I find degrading], the [person] has every right to be both angry and repulsed.—S.F.Certainly. And in addition to feeling angry or repulsed, they have every right to keep this material out of their relationships—as I clearly stated last week. But their right to do that ends at controlling whom will be their partner, not at controlling what their partner is permitted to enjoy.- - - - - - - -PORN IS INHERENTLY DEGRADING TO WOMEN!!!!—M.S.Interesting. I think it's degrading to women to say porn is inherently degrading to women. Of course, not all women choose porn out of desire or free agency, and especially during Sexual Assault Awareness Month, we should be cognizant of this fact and the institutional factors that make it so. But many women consume and/or participate in porn actively and frequently, with enjoyment and discerning ethics.Discounting our participation erases our sexual agency and restricts our free sexual expression.I also think it's degrading to read all these e-mails assuming last week's letter applies to a delicate ladyflower letter-writer and her big rapey porn-watching boyfriend. Because feminism is best advanced and defended with a healthy dose of gender stereotyping and heteronormativity, right?- - - - - - - -[Last week's] column telling """"PORN"""" that [they] should just keep quiet about [their] boyfriend's disgusting pornography collection was a disgrace to women in relationships. You basically said that [they] should keep [their] mouth shut while [their] boyfriend masturbates to material that requires the mistreatment and degradation of women. You said that [PORN] can set boundaries in [their] relationship, but there's no way [to] set boundaries if you can't talk about it.—M.C.Let's examine what the letter-writer said last week, shall we? In PORN's own words, """"I found some porn [on my bf's computer]. I didn't like it at all … this particular material was such a turnoff."""" That gives no indication whatsoever about kind of material PORN found, so why don't we cut the assumptions about it, eh?Yes, it certainly could have been violent. Or maybe it depicted a completely consensual activity PORN happens to find unsexy. Maybe PORN had some homophobia surface after finding gay porn. Perhaps PORN was appalled that the actors were not using condoms or barriers.If you're out there, PORN, I'm not accusing you of anything in the previous paragraph. My point is that we know absolutely nothing about PORN's particular circumstances, and any one of those totally non-violent scenarios is plausible. It's irresponsible and inconsiderate for readers and particularly for me as a sex advice columnist to flesh out writers' stories with details not included or specified in their letters.And, per my advice last week, it's irresponsible and inconsiderate for people to barge into conversations with their lovers—especially conversations which will likely and perhaps inevitably result in one party feeling shamed for their sexual desires and enjoyment—without considering their words and aims carefully first.Finally, even if the porn was violent, that still doesn't necessarily legitimize these kinds of sneering reactions. First, """"violent"""" and """"nonconsensual"""" are not synonyms. Some activities, in porn and in real bedrooms, which may be perceived as violent to an outsider may be consensual and in fact desired and enjoyed by all parties in a scene.Second, there is a boundary between fantasy and reality. Without a doubt, there is pornography out there that dehumanizes people. But this starts to occur precisely when consumers begin to unquestioningly conflate these images with reality—assuming that's what all sex should look like, that that's the best and most/only pleasurable way to fuck or be fucked. Thus, those who seek to dismantle these kinds of degrading attitudes are better served by drawing sharp distinctions between pornography and """"real life""""—not by further blurring the lines between the two.If we choose to enjoy porn, we can also choose websites and production companies that clearly demarcate the division between fantasy and reality as well as demonstrate unequivocal respect for the ways in which performers are treated behind and in the scenes—no matter what the scenes depict. We can also demonstrate this kind of respect for consent and pleasure with our own partners.Porn isn't for everybody, and even people who enjoy porn generally don't indiscriminately enjoy all kinds of porn. That's fine. Nobody should be required to observe or participate in a sexual act that makes them uncomfortable. I mean, duh.But seriously. Andrea Dworkin is dead. Let's move on. Comments? Questions?

Despite the misconception that only a stronger partner can be abusive, she said, the assumed lack of gender dominance in homosexual relationships does not prevent abuse.""""Power and control is available to anyone,"""" Herrmann said.She said some LGBT victims who have yet to come out are hesitant to seek help out of fear that their abusers might reveal the victims' sexual orientation. Compounding the problem, there are fewer legal protections for the LGBT community.Herrmann said most victims report abuse to trusted family members or friends, but feel uncomfortable reporting abuse to agencies. Less than 2 percent of LGBT victims report to shelters, according to Herrmann.She said since LGBT victims report abuse less often than heterosexual victims, agencies fail to recognize the number of abusive relationships in the LGBT community.",LBGT workshop tackles same-sex partner abuse,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/04/an-invisible-problem,"April 11, 2011 | 1:00am CDT","Although sexual assault is often viewed as violence perpetrated by a man against a woman, the same trauma experienced by those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning often goes unreported.""""There's such a small amount of research out there on that that I don't think anyone is well-versed on statistics or how often it is happening,"""" Robin Matthies, interim director of UW-Madison's LGBT Campus Center said. """"And there's a lot of stereotypes that this doesn't happen within the LGBT community and especially within relationships. It's sort of an invisible problem.""""She said researchers tend to leave out the LGBT population when studying domestic violence and sexual assault, thereby setting the community apart and rendering them invisible.""""For the most part, this is something that is not researched enough and it's a shame because people are suffering from being victims of intimate partner violence and sexual assault within the community,"""" Matthies said. """"And there's different means to address some of the issues that LGBT people would face versus heterosexually identified people.""""Overcoming barriersMatthies spoke generally about potential barriers that prevent someone from the LGBT community from reporting a sexual assault to the police both on and off campus.She said people who identify as LGBT may be more timid about going to police because stories in the media at times perpetuate the image of unfair treatment of the LGBT community by officers. Matthies said she would like to say the UW Police Department is doing its best. However, she still noted an """"overarching uncomfortability"""" around police, specifically for victims who do not fit into societal gender norms.Lieutenant Peter Ystenes of the UWPD said the protocol for assisting all sexual assault victims is the same regardless of gender orientation.""""If it is brought to our attention by the victim that there was a sexual assault we do everything in our power, and our first concentration is the safety and well being of that person,"""" Ystenes said. He added that UWPD might try to connect an LGBT student to other support groups in addition to advocates on campus.This method is not uncommon at UW-Madison, where the Dean of Students Office also offers the same options to all victims of sexual assault. Still, informal connections throughout campus allow those like Tonya Schmidt, an assistant dean in the Division of Student Life, to seek additional help for students outside the counseling or student judicial process the university offers.""""If I'm serving as the resource assistance person to a male who is not out, I don't have anything to offer him in that area,"""" Schmidt said. """"I can't tell him what it's like to be a gay man. I can't tell him what it was like for me as a gay man to come out to my parents or friends. I need to make sure I get him connected with somebody else who knows.""""Schmidt said students who are out and have good support networks do not always need this form of help, though it may play an important role for students who are not out and do not have that support.Larry Davis is the associate residence life director who works with diversity programs in university housing. He is also a gay administrator on campus who has assisted a number of male students after they were sexually assaulted.He said whether LGBT students report a sexual assault may depend both on if they have come out and if they are worried about how they may be treated as members of the LGBT community.""""I think sometimes people assume that if you identify as LGBT that that automatically means you're sexually active and sexually promiscuous and all of that stuff and that's clearly not the case,"""" he said. """"So I think students are sometimes worried about the assumptions people will make if they are sexually assaulted."""" Keeping this in mind, he said, the university may involve UWPD officers, counselors or housing staffers who identify as LGBT to help victims decide how they would like to move forward with the case.Looking ForwardStill, Schmidt said there is room for improvement in the resources offered on campus.""""The sexual assault field is filled with women. We're typically the victims,"""" she said. """"It's not to say that there can't be male victims. It's not to say that there can't be female victims that identify as a lesbian or trangender, but it's mostly women. So there are lots of resources [for women].""""Educating the campus about sexual assault within the LGBT community is not written explicitly into any job description, but rather requires the time and effort of various people around campus in addition to their other commitments.Last year a group of UW employees, including Schmidt, offered a day-long training on working with students from the LGBT community who were sexually assaulted.""""We didn't do it again this year,"""" Schmidt said. """"Some of these trainings are a committed four or five people really who think the information is important and have time to do it.

The diocese prohibited Clauder from the public ministry after further investigation into the allegations.The charges stem back from an incident that dates to 2004, King said.In 2009, the diocese said the woman, who at the time was a minor, claimed Clauder had made inappropriate sexual contact with the woman in 2004.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/01/despite-off-field-past-roethlisberger-will-be-a-formidable-opponent,"January 26, 2011 | 12:00am CST","As soon as Todd Collins entered Sunday's NFC Championship Game at quarterback for the Chicago Bears in the third quarter, it was obvious what would happen—and no, I'm not talking about the Packers winning. It became immediately clear Jay Cutler would get trashed by the Bears' faithful fans and any number of media outlets (Chicago outlets in particular) for not trying to tough it out and finish the game.It's interesting to me because now, even after an MRI revealed Cutler suffered a sprained MCL, the vitriol from the fan-base hasn't subsided as much as I would have thought. Maybe it's pent-up frustrations with the quarterback play in the Windy City finally spewing out, and maybe as football fans we just have unrealistic expectations in regards to playing through injuries.Either way, I've been saying for the last two years that we've seen enough of Cutler to know that he just doesn't have the make-up of a franchise cornerstone. The dude has a major-league arm, but for whatever reason, he just hasn't put it together.The Bears aren't alone in their search for the ever-elusive ‘franchise quarterback.' Many teams have spent years hoping to strike gold on a signal-caller. Cutler certainly has the talent, but other things about him—namely reputation and a sense of disconnect when he plays—seem to have gotten in his way. The bottom line is that it takes more than one area of excellence to be considered a franchise-making quarterback.Another guy I would omit from a list of franchise quarterbacks in the NFL is the Packers' next opponent, Steelers field-general Ben Roethlisberger. Yeah, he became the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl in 2006, and yes, he has a chance to add a third world title before his 29th birthday. The problem is last summer's sexual assault allegations (regardless of what came of them). The problem is the off-seasons motorcycle accident over the 2006 offseason that included serious injuries and no helmet.Big Ben has repeatedly said he's a new man, but it will take more than that for me to believe it. If I was starting a football team, I would take Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Matt Ryan and Phillip Rivers before Roethlisberger. There is at least a chance that Matthew Stafford, Sam Bradford and Josh Freeman could add their names to that list in the next three or four years, though they do not make the cut today.Here's the big difference between Roethlisberger and a guy like Cutler, though. It scares the daylights out of me to have to go up against Big Ben for one game, with everything on the line.For all the questions I have about his maturity and decision-making that might keep me from making him my first long-term solution, he has the guts, moxie and play-making ability to make him the most feared single-game opponent in football. Bar none.He puts ridiculous numbers in the clutch.This past regular season (12 starts, after being suspended the first four games), Big Ben posted a 110.3 passer rating in the fourth quarter. That number was even better on third down (114.2). In situations when the Steelers were ahead or behind by eight points or fewer, Roethlisberger tossed eight touchdowns, ran for another and only threw one interception.Those kind of numbers are not unique to 2010. Roethlisberger has 19 come-from-behind wins in 99 career starts (for reference, Peyton Manning has 35 in 210). His career record in the postseason is 10-2, whereas Manning is 9-9.More than anything, though, Roethlisberger just has an aura about him and a knack for making memorable plays in key moments. The throw he made to Santonio Holmes in Super Bowl XLIII in the final minute had such pinpoint accuracy that it appeared to be a once-in-a-lifetime strike, except that he made a nearly identical throw to beat the Packers in the following regular season. Even when the Ravens jumped out to a 21-7 lead against the Steelers in the AFC Divisional playoffs two weeks ago --  did you really think Big Ben would go down quietly?Between him and Rodgers, this Super Bowl is almost sure to be decided by two quarterbacks who are masters of improvisation. Aside from Michael Vick, these two might be the most dangerous quarterbacks once a play breaks down. With the way each defenses put pressure on the passer, both will have to continue to have success on the run in order to hoist the Lombardi Trophy on Feb. 6.Rodgers is one game away from his first championship and in charge of an organization that looks poised to challenge for more in the yearsahead. Roethlisberger is already there, though, and despite his past personal problems, he is a formidable opponent in Super Bowl XLV.Where would you rank Big Ben on a list of NFL quarterbacks?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/12/stories-that-went-under-the-radar,"December 9, 2012 | 10:34pm CST","The Daily Cardinal Editorial Board covers a lot of stories in its infinite wisdom. These are the stories that didn’t make the cut, but are still important.Occupy Madison refocuses purposeFlying under the radar this year has been the Occupy Madison movement.It has been over a year since the Occupy movement began. When thousands of anti-Wall Street protesters poured into New York City’s Zuccotti Park, it captured the attention of everyone. It inspired those who wanted to fight against injustice, but it also angered those who saw the movement as a socialistic waste of time. Nevertheless, the movement spread everywhere, including our humble city.The Occupy movement has noble goals of ending wealth inequality, fighting corruption and, at least in their view, making America a better place. But it is hard to get behind a movement that seems so aimless.Fortunately for Occupy Madison, those things cannot now be said about the group. Mired in awkward controversy last year, the group has had a resurgence. Like a student who finally picks up his or her grades, focus seems to be the factor that brought Occupy Madison to the status of a legitimate group.Instead of focusing on abstract concepts, the group is highly focused on homelessness. It is an issue that is hard to tackle. It involves societal failures as well as personal issues like drug abuse and mental illness. Instead of just picketing and chanting, Occupy Madison has lobbied city Council and worked with authorities. It seems if Council, Occupy Madison and other homeless activists keep the good work up, Madison may be able to make positive strides in this issue.The city needs to continue addressing issues that are at the root of homelessness, and mediating structures like Occupy Madison are in a good place to help by providing temporary housing, positive influence in government and surprisingly good publicity.For many, Occupy has been good fodder for jokes (watch sitcoms and you’ll see) but Occupy Madison is anything but a joke. It is helping the city, but more importantly it is helping those who need it the most.Crime culture growsAlthough there was a significant amount of coverage about various crimes happening throughout Madison this semester, the sheer rate of increasing crime—and the severity of what that means for our community—seems to have gone under the radar.According to our interview with Ald. Scott Resnick, District 8, the majority of threats to student security on campus come from the gentrification of student areas into nearby neighborhoods, a general increase in gun culture, and the continued threat of sexual assault that is present on most college campuses. Recognizing the threat to safety, there have been several city initiatives this year which attempt to increase lighting in poorly lit areas, as well as push for better building design in new developments to prevent break-ins.However, it is clear that what the city has been able to provide is not enough to ensure safety on our campus. Stories of robberies at gunpoint, sexual assaults and break-ins are increasingly frequent, staring back at students from the front pages of the city’s newspapers and magazines. Fear is becoming more and more prevalent in the campus atmosphere, and it needs to change.Not only do we need better lock-change policies and regulations on new buildings being built, it is imperative that landlords agree to change locks on old buildings much more frequently as well. We need more police on the streets later at night, maintaining high visibility and patrolling campus areas past bar time—when many students are at their most vulnerable.Of course, we do not hope to push the crime that is occurring in the campus and downtown area to other areas of Madison—with well-thought-out preventative measures, it is possible to decrease the rate of crime throughout the city. Guardian Angels, a volunteer-based organization that works to keep the city safe by providing self-defense and safety seminars as well as organize street patrols, is an excellent example of how citizens and the city government can reclaim the community and make it safer. Putting more money, time and effort into preventative measures will hopefully quell the rising tide of crime in the city, and make it a welcoming place for students and community members alike.Student group tests SSFC funding rulesNearly every year, an occasion arises that calls into question the legitimacy of the means through which student groups receive funding through segregated fees. This year, many individuals across campus are criticizing the leaders of the newly formed Medieval Warriorcraft League for allegedly manipulating the funding streams to highlight the flaws in the system.While group leaders say they are seeking funding because the group provides legitimate services to students, such as warrior trainings, individuals involved in creating the group, like former Student Services Finance Committee Chair Matt Manes, are knowledgeable in GSSF funding and have expressed concern over the current system in recent years.Some students across campus argue that group leaders are trying to demonstrate that any student group can manipulate its funding eligibility information in its favor to receive segregated fee funding, while groups that provide genuine services to students, such as the Multicultural Student Coalition, are denied simply because of subpar eligibility presentations.While we believe the point allegedly being made is a valid one, it is being done at the expense of students. The group is slated to receive over $95,000 in funding through student fees. Around half of this money will go towards purchasing medieval weaponry and safety equipment.We believe that however valid the argument is, every cent of a student’s tuition is valuable and should not be spent on purchasing expensive equipment for the sake of making a point.Walker’s health care decision pettyOver the summer, the Supreme Court upheld the majority of the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act. Emotions were high, as should be expected, since it was one of the biggest decisions of the year. But the court decision was just the beginning. Now work needs to be done.Part of the law requires so-called health care exchanges to be implemented in every state. These are a set of health insurance plans the federal government approves of and may subsidize. Gov. Scott Walker decided not to implement the exchange; he instead will allow (or force) the federal government to do it for his own state.This board disapproves of that decision.In an age where people are obsessed with the partisanship that permeates through the State Capitol and Washington, D.C., refusing to work with the federal government shows a new level of pettiness. The exchange needs to be set up; it is the law. Instead of doing the work for his own citizens, Walker is passing the buck to the feds. He even had the option to work with the federal government, but did not take that opportunity.Beyond being bad politics, passing up the opportunity is not the best policy. Wisconsin has a history of improving health care access in the state, and the state knows best what its citizens need. If Walker would have worked to set up viable exchanges, it would give Wisconsin citizens visibility to health care plans they need, and the state would be less subordinate to the federal government than it will be now.Walker’s decision to pass the buck on the health care exchange is another example of the partisanship in government today. We understand that Walker is against the Affordable Care Act, but his disapproval is not an excuse to work in bad faith.SSFC right to give funding to AHAOf all of the decisions the Student Services Finance Committee has made throughout its existence, the committee’s ruling this year to fund the student group Atheists, Humanists and Agnostics has elicited some of the most national attention the committee has ever received.AHA is set to receive funds through student segregated fees totaling almost $70,000, the highest any non-theistic student organization has ever received nationally.Perhaps it is the high amount of funding the group is receiving that led reputable news sources such as The Washington Post to report on the committee’s decision, but in our minds SSFC ruled properly in granting the group eligibility for funding.No matter how controversial a group’s stances on issues may be, SSFC is prohibited from considering the viewpoints of organizations applying for funding when determining if they are eligible or not. The committee held to their vow to remain neutral in making funding decisions when ruling in favor of AHA.While the decision seemed to be controversial on a national level, funding AHA through segregated fees is no different in principle than funding groups such as Badger Catholic, which historically has had a hefty budget on the UW-Madison campus.In maintaining viewpoint neutrality, SSFC does not fund Catholicism or Atheism when allocating student fees to these organizations, but rather the services that the groups provide to the student body, such as counseling.In our minds, SSFC had no option but to fund AHA. The group met all requirements for funding eligibility, leaving little room for debate about whether the committee made the correct decision.",Stories that went under the radar,UWM

We feel that this existing campus-wide policy is unknown and we are reaching out to the student body to clarify the existing policy and what it is we are working on. The current Responsible Action policy has guidelines that encourage responsible action in the case that a student requires medical assistance for alcohol-related injuries.  We believe that protecting the student body and making the university a safe place are both very important roles of the ASM.To be clear, this policy allows for a student who chooses to call on behalf of another impaired individual to not be subjected to disciplinary sanctions. As long as the student cooperates with authority, they will not be given a citation. This policy applies only to University of Wisconsin-Madison police officers, at the moment.  The Responsible Action policy also protects victims of crimes, such as sexual assault, from disciplinary or criminal action due to illegal intoxication. Students should always feel safe reporting unsafe situations without the concern of their own personal disciplinary actions if they are under the influence.We encourage you to contact us with your questions in regard to this policy or attend one of our Legislative Affairs Committee meetings, Mondays 7 P.M. in the SAC.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/10/police-say-freakfest-as-safe-as-any-other-saturday-night,"October 25, 2012 | 2:34am CDT","While Freakfest was plagued with riots and violence in 2006, officials say the city’s annual Halloween bash is on its way to becoming as safe as any other weekend night on State Street.Madison Police Department Lt. Dave McCaw said because of the police presence, Freakfest is “more safe than any other day on State Street, any other Saturday night,” which is a major transformation from what the street used to look like on Halloween.Before former mayor Dave Cieslewicz implemented Freakfest, McCaw said Halloween on State Street was a dangerous event with riots, looting and overcrowding.“It’s certainly [showed] a downward trend of Halloween being some unsafe event,” McCaw said. “If anything, it’s becoming a much safer event.”In 2011, the Madison Police Department arrested and cited 32 people, which was a decrease from 2010 when there were 43 arrests and citations, according to MPD spokesperson Joel DeSpain.While Halloween on State Street may be safer, there are still arrests and citations for open intoxicants, violations of the city’s glass ban on State Street, and disorderly conduct.McCaw said special events team officers are trained to recognize possible problematic scenarios early on, which is key to maintaining a safe atmosphere on State Street.“The issue that we stress with our special events team is detecting these things before they become arrests,” McCaw said.When looking for arrests at Freakfest, special events team officers are aware of incidents that will lead to violence, such as people throwing objects, fighting in the streets, and behavior that could be classified as sexual assault, as well as destruction to private property.Police also keep an eye out for people who put themselves in danger, such as an intoxicated individual who is passed out alone in the streets, according to McCaw. But McCaw said police rarely cite an individual who is extremely inebriated.“It’s a rare beast that I’ve ever put a ticket in a passed-out person’s pocket on the way to the ambulance,” McCaw said.Although many students equate Freakfest with the annual Mifflin Street Block Party held in May, Ald. Scott Resnick, District 8, said Freakfest’s focus on live entertainment and not on alcohol consumption greatly differentiates it from the Mifflin Street Block Party, at which police reported 393 arrests and citations in 2012.“One of the biggest issues is that the current [Mifflin block party] is perceived as only alcohol, whereas for Freakfest...there is a lot more going on than just drinking.”McCaw also said the lack of alcohol at Freakfest makes it an easier event to monitor.“The [police] department’s opinion is that the alcohol-fueled events are the ones we can’t control,” McCaw said.",Police say Freakfest as safe as ‘any other Saturday night’,UWM

The name was changed at the author’s request.I looked down and all I could see were pink, fuzzy blurs.They were my socks. The only thing still left on my body. They were the socks my ex-boyfriend had given me for Valentine’s Day the year before. Hideous things. But hell, they kept my feet warm on cold Madison nights. So I wore them out to the bar underneath my boots.I looked left. There was a belt on the floor. Not mine. I looked up. The door was wide open. I looked down. An unstrapped bra. Unzipped pants. Both mine. And then, pain. I screamed.My roommates, my best friends in college, woke up and called the police. The next thing I knew, two officers, one male and one female were questioning me in my room.They would have to confiscate almost everything in my room for evidence, they said. Never to be returned unless I formally filed a suit against my perpetrator. My comforter, my sheets, my pillows, my jeans and shirts, and even my pink fuzzy socks—they took it all. Damn it, I miss those socks. My room was stripped bare.What happened next seems eerily familiar to the account written by Angie Epifano from Amherst College last week. Her anecdote quickly spread across the Internet, causing uproar among students and staff at her own college, but also among thousands of others around the country who caught a glimpse into the life of someone who had been raped.My rape incident happened to me in the least expected of places—at UW-Madison, a university that I had grown to call home. It happened in my apartment—a place I had lived comfortably for three years. It is true what they say. You never think it is going to happen to you until it does. And then, it is all you can think about. Sometimes for weeks, or in my case, for months.I do not have the exact same story as Angie, but I share her frustration. The interactions Angie had with campus officials and police officers at Amherst match those I had at UW-Madison. Coincidentally, Biddy Martin was my chancellor at UW-Madison when I was raped, and now presides as president at Amherst College.I was taken by the police officers to the Emergency Room at Meriter Hospital on the outskirts of campus. I waited several hours for the nurses to take me to the exam room where they performed a Rape kit. It was during these hours that my roommates had to call my mother, who happened to be in Chicago that weekend, to rent a car and drive to Madison.After returning to my apartment room on Gorham, where I slept on a bare mattress, I had to decide what I was going to do. Would I file a complaint? Or would I just let it pass?The detective called me the next day. She said she was going to talk to the boy who I thought was my perpetrator. I didn’t go to class that day. I waited by the phone. I wondered what he would say. Would he admit it? Would he be taken to jail?Finally. She called back.“I talked to him,” she said. “He said you had been drinking that night at the bar.”“Well, yes,” I said. “I am over the age of 21 and I was at a bar. I had a few drinks.”“He seemed to be really upset about the matter,” the officer said. “He said he heard you say ‘stop’ but didn’t know that you actually wanted him to stop.”Oh great, he feels bad. That makes everything better. And what the hell else does stop mean, then? I thought.“So, where do we go from here?” I asked the officer.“Well it seems like this is all I can do from my end. If you want to file a formal complaint you will have to do it through the police department on campus.”The next day I went to visit counselors on campus who work with victims of sexual assault. I had launched a series on the crime for The Daily Cardinal during my time at the paper, and had spoken with several of these women for interviews before. I trusted them. But when I walked into the room, I felt anything but comfortable.A woman sat across a long table from me. A box of tissues separated us. She began to speak. It was almost like a speech. She didn’t even look me in the eye. She encouraged me not to proceed with the trial because it was my senior year, and would I really want to spend it in a courtroom? And besides, she said, the DA rarely picks up these cases unless there is enough evidence. And it is just going to be my word against his. And who knows how that would turn out, she said.It was during this time of vulnerability, the first few days after being raped, that I needed support from university counselors and officials. But instead, I was deterred from going back to the counselors, and from filing a formal complaint. I have spent almost every day since wishing that I had.But it was easier then to push it aside then. It was midterms. And I needed to focus on school. I needed to find a job for after graduation. And I needed to buy some new socks. (I bought purple fuzzy ones the next day).In 2010 the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism assembled a website documenting and analyzing sexual assault numbers throughout the UW System. According to its report, national research suggests there may be about 750 rapes or attempted rapes a year at a school the size of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with about 21,600 women. But according to the UW-Madison 2010 Campus Crime Statistics, the university had a reported 16 forcible sex offenses on campus that year.It is a well-known fact that sexual assaults are one of the most underreported crimes in the nation. And I contributed to that trend. But I never thought that university officials, or police officers, would play a part in that process. I never thought they would play a part in that discouragement. I wish every day that I had reported the crime formally. Maybe my report would have strengthened the fight against sexual assault and rape, at least on the UW-Madison campus.I have spent the last two years pushing my rape to the side and pretending that it didn’t happen. It was easier to focus on my career, and to move on as quickly as possible from that pain. Until I read Angie’s testimony, I never had any intention of speaking up about what happened to me at Madison. But for one reason or another, Angie’s words motivated me to speak up about sexual assault at UW-Madison—a campus that has experienced at least one high-profile case of rape within the past five years.What I know is that rape happens every day to both men and women around the world. I recently moved back from overseas where I heard testimonies of heinous sexual assault and rape. My story barely compares to these. But rape is rape. And no matter what way we put it, rape matters. It should matter to universities like UW-Madison. It should matter to university officials that students on campus understand how widespread the issue actually is. And how often that statistic is distorted.University officials need to do more to help victims of rape on campus. They need to provide services that will allow victims to choose which path to take—to file a complaint, or to stay silent. Whatever the choice, it should be the victim’s, not the university’s.Please send feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.Update: Dean of Student Lori Berquam, UWPD Chief Susan Riseling and UHS Director Sarah Van Orman posted the following response to the article on the university's website: http://www.news.wisc.edu/21192",Alumna recounts sexual assault at UW,UWM

Kyle Quagliana said he felt uncomfortable funding the position at it’s full request.“The vibe that I got was that this individual would be solely there for tweeting and facebook,” Quagliana said. “I feel like that could be a volunteer, honestly.”The group reduced the marketing director role to only five hours per week.The committee had similar worries with M.E.Ch.A’s budget, which was approved at $90,153.Members felt uncomfortable funding the group’s full travel request for all its staff members to attend a national conference.Rep. Sarah Neibart said she felt a reduction would be a good way to ensure that members who do attend the conference must come back and share what they learn with the rest of the M.E.Ch.A staff and campus community.Also in the meeting, the committee heard Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment’s budget proposal.According to PAVE representatives, the group is asking for a funding increase of 4.2 percent due to the growing importance of their Communications Director, who works to ensure campus is properly informed when discussing sexual assault and violence.SSFC will decide on PAVE’s 2013-2014 funding level at its next meeting Monday.",SSFC passes group budgets,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/10/letter-domestic-violence-affects-all-students,"October 2, 2012 | 11:44pm CDT","When it comes to sexual violence, particularly domestic/dating violence, it is easy for students to dismiss the issues believing it an issue that does not affect them. Unfortunately, students are more at risk than many believe. According to domestic violence expert Dr. Sandra Stith, about 30 percent of college students have been in relationships involving physical aggression and even more have been in emotionally abusive relationships.Beginning today, Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment (PAVE), a student organization on campus, will be recognizing Domestic Violence Awareness Month throughout the month of October. DVAM is a nationally recognized time of both observance and action. PAVE is taking a stand for the University of Wisconsin-Madison by creating awareness about domestic violence’s existence on campus.Domestic/dating violence is an ongoing pattern of controlling and coercive behaviors by one person in a relationship. This may include physical, sexual and psychological attacks, as well as controlling finances, perpetrated by adults or adolescents against their former or current intimate partners.Control and coercion distinguish appropriate disagreements and arguments from an abusive relationship. When the two individuals no longer have equal power in the relationship, it becomes abusive.Domestic violence can affect any individual regardless of sex, gender, race or sexual orientation. Domestic violence is not a “women’s problem,” but rather a problem for entire communities, such as the UW-Madison campus.Some students may think, “Domestic violence only happens to married couples, so this issue doesn’t really affect me at all since I’m not married and just a college student.”Unfortunately, domestic/dating violence affects all types of relationships—marital or not. Domestic/dating violence is common even on college campuses like ours. In fact, 18 to24 year olds make up 11.7 percent of the general population, but accounted for the majority (42 percent) of violence by their boyfriend or girlfriend.This means, contrary to people’s beliefs, even our fellow UW-Madison students could possibly be survivors of domestic violence or involved in an abusive relationship.When it comes to domestic/dating violence, there is oftentimes no physical evidence. For victims, it might be easy to cover up any physical evidence such as bruises, but the effects of domestic/dating violence are nearly impossible to be erased.In addition to physical violence, there are also behavioral warning signs of domestic/dating violence such as extreme jealousy, controlling who the partner can spend time with, ultimatums or threats.If you believe you may be in an abusive relationship, it is not your fault. Remember that you are not alone. There is help for anyone in an abusive relationship and you can get out of it, even though it might seem impossible. The city of Madison community as well as the university offer plenty of outlets for assistance.It is unfortunate that chances are even if you are not experiencing some of dating/domestic violence, someone you know is. There are ways for you to speak out against this issues and become an ally for domestic violence victims. Be an advocate.The National Day of Unity, a day started by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) to connect advocates against domestic violence together. A day of awareness raising turned into an entire month, and that is how DVAM is now celebrated throughout the entire month of October.If you believe you are in an abusive relationship, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-723 for assistance. Locally, you can call Madison’s Domestic Abuse Intervention Service’s hotline at 608-251-4445.PAVE is a student organization dedicated to preventing sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking on the UW-Madison campus through education and activism.  PAVE’s general member meeting will be held at 7 p.m. on Oct. 18 in the PAVE office, room #3147 of the Student Activity Center.

Mike Verveer, District 4, who represents the area including Mifflin Street, said Rosenow deserves to be incarcerated.“I’m pleased that the court sentenced the attacker to real prison time,” Verveer said. “I think it’s only by perhaps sheer dumb luck that the student victim was not murdered that afternoon.”A second stabbing also occurred at the 2011 Mifflin Street Block Party in addition to injured police officers, fights, sexual assaults and a high number of intoxicated party attendants.“[The stabbing] cemented for me the notion that it is impossible to make this a safe event,” Verveer said.The violence, especially the stabbing of a UW-Madison student, led to stricter enforcement laws at the 2012 party and will continue for this year’s inevitable event, according to Verveer.Mayor Paul Soglin met with police officials for the first time last week to discuss their initial planning for the 2013 block party, although no official steps have been taken.But Verveer said city and police officials have suggested moving the event off of Mifflin Street to a safer location such as a park or city parking lot.“For that to happen we need an entity to come forward that would agree to come forward and organize the event and move the event to another location,” Verveer said.Freakfest 2012, scheduled for late October, is currently the priority of city and police officials, according to Verveer.",Court sentences man responsible for 2011 Mifflin Street Block Party stabbings to two and a half years in prison,UWM

Student groups must devote 51 percent of their time offering direct services to receive eligibility.“While there are other health services that provide moderately similar functions, [PAVE] has demonstrated that their service is much more tailorable and requestable,” SSFC Rep. David Vines said. “They provide peer to peer counseling, which I think is not insignificant.”SLP, a student organization devoted to increasing leadership skills in individual students and student organization leaders, also gained approval to submit its funding request.Some SSFC representatives voiced their concern over the similarities between some SLP workshops and other programs provided by the university, however SSFC approved the group’s eligibility because more than 51 percent of SLP service hours directly serve students.","SSFC grants funding eligibility to leadership, sexual assault awareness student groups",UWM

Dave McCaw said additional officers and sergeants will be on duty Saturday to effectively monitor and shut down out-of-control parties.Regent and Langdon Streets and Breese Terrace are popular areas for tailgates and house parties before Badger football games.“[Deploying more officers] is an initiative that happens every fall when we find out we’re dealing with new students who have recently moved from dorms into apartment life,” McCaw said.Police are concerned about this Saturday’s 7 p.m. kickoff time because it allows students to consume more alcohol before attending the game.McCaw said detox fills up much more quickly with later kickoff times, and police often encounter drunk students making “illogical” decisions like laying in front of cars on Regent Street.MPD officers begin patrolling at 8:00 a.m. regardless of the game’s start time and will be monitoring these areas closely on bike, on foot and by car, according to McCaw.McCaw said the increased police presence is a result of the recent escalating crime downtown including the attack on Badgers’ senior running back Montee ball on Aug. 1 and an out-of-control house party on Sept. 9 on the 600 block of East Johnson Street.House parties like the one on Sep. 9 where four men beat up two other men at the party are an example of how situations can quickly escalate when the hosts do not know those in attendance, according to McCaw.McCaw said property damage and theft are common occurrences at parties like these in addition to more serious crimes that “tug at cops’ hearts” like sexual assaults.If you do intend to host or attend a party on Saturday, McCaw said to “keep it small.”“You have to keep control early to...have the party you want,” McCaw said.Loud music, calls for service and underage drinking are sure signs that cops will bust your party, according to McCaw.When students are cited or arrested, the MPD will notify the University of Wisconsin-Madison dean’s office, according to Assistant Dean of Students Bryan Bain.The dean’s office will review the police report and determine consequences based on UW-Madison’s non-academic misconduct code.“I think inherent in all our conversations is [students’] safety,” Bryan said.Bryan said while many students feel at home on UW-Madison’s campus, students should be aware crime does happen.“The reality is there are people out there ready to take advantage of students,” Bryan said. “...We don’t want to see anyone become a victim.”",Police to increase football gameday presence,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/09/navigating-rack-city-implications-of-tygas-new-ventures,"September 13, 2012 | 9:11pm CDT","If you’re reading this column, you must possess an understanding of the glimmering piece of art that glows in the limelight of strip-clubs and on-campus apartments nationwide (and potentially worldwide). It is this minimalist megahit that involves money, a type of territory and how they flow in an effortless tangent of twerkable genius.This piece of art is called “Rack City” by Tyga. And it is art, no matter how you define it or choose to exclude it like strip-club anthems have never existed.This is not the first of its type and it will not be the last. Tyga, government name Michael Ray Nguyen-Stevenson, is not the first artist to dabble in multiple forms of entertainment. But Tyga (an acronym for “Thank You God, Always”) has delved even deeper into his persona to introduce another format of seedy exploitation to his repertoire: RackCityXXX. com. Yes. You can now fire knuckle children courtesy of the guy who made “Coconut Juice” as the protagonist. I bet you forgot that “Coconut Juice” existed. I also know that you forgot he’s Travie McCoy’s cousin, but I digress.The players are the usual suspect porn stars so sensitively dubbed “Rack City Bitches”. There’s “Rack City, Bitch” merchandising as well: T-shirts right now, but maybe he’ll bring snapbacks back? $99 a year gets you the plane ticket to Rack City and by then it’s too late: you’re enslaved to the familiarity of the DJ Mustard synth line and Tyga’s SAG card is still processing. Then the usual pornography fare occurs and you mute your computer so your House Fellow doesn’t hear since quiet hours started two hours ago.It’s not unique, but in some ways is, and I think Tyga will merely become another martyr for our sexual insecurities. Thus, the blame game continues.It only took the site’s initial 110-second trailer to cause my hidden internal feminist to overflow into a torrent of “What the fuck? Why, God? Is this reality?” responses. I’ve swan-dived in the deep blue sea of faux-misogyny humor too many times to count in both public and private settings. And in these settings, among men and women of varying social orientations, that damn “Rack City” art piece has been the proverbial red herring time and again. It’s dispensed as a meaningless sentence enhancer among the intelligent and tolerant. But I honestly wanted this to be a Funny or Die assault on our heartstrings. Or an Onion side joke. Or a rouge for Tyga’s upcoming Adult Video News Awards performance.But, nah. This shit exists. And it’s not the actual pornography or Tyga that caused my feelings; it’s our collective hypocrisy toward the topic and how it furthers the constant divide.Porn and hip-hop intersect more frequently than many understand. Snoop Dogg (Lion omitted) won two Adult Video News awards in 2002 for his “Doggystyle” tape being a top seller with a top-notch soundtrack. You know who else has done so? Everyone has, including Ice-T, Too $hort, Mystikal, Uncle Luke, DJ Yella, Kool Keith, the entire G-Unit and (no matter how much you don’t want to claim him) Brian Pumper. Even Kanye mentioned he’d want to go for it, which would probably end up involving a phoenix, a Murcielago, an exotic sofa and John Legend’s eyebrows. This is nothing new, and Tyga’s marketing ploy is just as convenient as it is provocative. We already use “Rack City” as a conversational red herring, we already reinforce the context, and humans love sex. When has morality appeared in your subconscious when you go to Brazzers? Oh. It’s a golden ticket to the Chocolate Factory. Or Tyga’s mansion. Pick a door, chap. (Oh God, unintentional double entendre.)But here’s where the plot thickens/twerks harder: We can blame Tyga or Snoop or Pumper (#BlamePumper) for being practitioners of the sexist systems in place, but they are not the originators. And until we (consumers, thinkers, political figures, and sexual beings) come to grips with the fact that we provide the market for this trade to continue, we have absolutely no right to be upset. But can we ever stop? I don’t know if we will ever come full circle with our insecurities. Life is contradiction and we are the fallible condemned to our imperfections. We can write theories on sexism and misogyny by day, but we’re still hormonal, New Glarus-slurping scoundrels by 1:26 a.m. when the party hits its peak and The Weeknd hits another off-pitch note about snorting another line of coke.They will write pieces on this. Feminists will condemn him for utilizing his star power in this conceptually-screwed industry. Fanboys (and maybe fangirls) will defend RackCityXXX. com as its own think piece and champion Tyga for his strategy. And every confused, flawed, in-betweener hip-hop head will wander through this maze of human hypocrisy like we have been for centuries attempting to bring a better balance to the world through our own choices. I just hope you can take a few steps with me as we navigate these cities of racks aimlessly.And if you choose to step with me, by all means… make it nasty.Do you think Tyga takes too much heat for his new enterprise or do you think RackCityXXX. com is the root of all evil?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/09/new-sexual-assault-program-relates-better-to-students,"September 11, 2012 | 7:27pm CDT","University Health Services has taken it upon itself to create a brand new sexual assault awareness program titled Tonight. The program is an interactive video that asks students to evaluate situations and reflect on how they would react.Most of the concepts are pretty rudimentary and everyone in college has probably seen a video that teaches similar things by this point. However, Tonight incorporates a few things that other videos lack: slightly better acting, updated scenarios and an interactive format, all of which make it a beneficial resource.When the characters in a sex-ed video sniff out sketchy situations like Fred and Velma from Scooby Doo, you know you have a problem. Sexual assault exists, but people are generally not searching for offenders, and videos come off as extremely gimmicky when the actors pretend they do.Tonight is more compatible with this idea. The first potential assault is noticed in passing, giving everyone time to think through what is going on and assess whether or not action is necessary. The acting isn’t perfect, of course, but the people seem more like people and less like actors, making it more accessible to students.The problem of unrelatable characters is remedied by putting the students in normal clothes, filming them walking down an identifiable Madison street, and showing them entering the basement of a typical house party. While not all the dialogue is believable, the majority of the scenarios are plausible, meaning it is applicable to new students. The program hits into the heart of real student life, showing freshman what they can actually expect and giving them something to refer to when they encounter a similar situation.Really, the only problem with the Tonight program is that it’s mandated for new students. Talking about consent at this point feels a bit like beating a dead horse, and though the video is wonderful it seems like it would better serve its purpose if it were optional or shown in conjunction with certain classes.For example, joining Tonight with a FIG that focused on something like Women’s Studies or Sociology would allow it to reach an audience that was really interested in the material and promote discussion about the material. The way it is now, UHS may find many first years clicking through the scenes, volume muted as they watch the latest episode of Glee.Kate is sophomore majoring in English and Spanish.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/09/preventing-violence-should-be-a-priority,"September 11, 2012 | 7:09pm CDT","Those with the power and responsibility to look after the public’s safety are faced with a task of epic proportions. The job is never done, and any progress seems to eventually roll back down the proverbial hill.So seems the last year of crime in Madison. After fending off a heroin epidemic, Madison has seemed to hit a patch of other violent downtown crimes, with five incidents occurring last weekend. Crime happens often and will never be fully stopped, but that does not mean we should not look at its root causes and most effective mitigating solutions.This board believes curbing violent crime should be a priority for the city in general, and not just when there is a looming heroin epidemic. After an aggressive campaign over the summer, it is not necessarily evident this is the case. While eliminating the nuisances from State Street is beneficial, we would hope that Mayor Paul Soglin and the Common Cuncil would be more vocal with crime-deterring efforts.This is not to say Common Council is doing nothing. Ald. Mike Verveer, District 4, recently led efforts to add more lighting on University and Frances Streets. And Verveer also lauds the Downtown Safety Initiative as particularly effective, and it should be continued, evaluated and, if possible and necessary, expanded in the future.We suggest the ASM Legislative Affairs Committee work with the city to advance the needs of our students’ safety. It has been fairly evident that the committee’s state and national-level lobbying efforts are not particularly useful. But past lobbying to the city has been; see the change it helped get made for the Mifflin Street Block Party.But what should ASM and Legislative Affairs be trying to do?For starters, its members should be continually putting pressure to light areas of downtown. Lighting, as Verveer told The Daily Cardinal, is a good crime deterrent. Are there other equally useful actions? They should find out.ASM should also be directing students toward crime prevention programs, including the new UHS Tonight sexual assault course. The more that students know and understand crime, the safer and more helpful they will be in sticky situations.But students should also start stepping up to protect themselves. If you feel up to it, take a self-defense course or the Tonight course. As always, students should be smart, safe and with a group when they go out on the town, especially when drinking; most crimes are committed against people who are alone late at night. Know the SAFEWalk boundaries, which lie west of the Capitol. We do not want to sound like your mothers, but just remember to make wise decisions. It is an unfortunate thing that we need to alter our behavior to avoid criminal activity, but students can afford the hassle to keep themselves safer.Crime in Madison seems to be rising and, to put it simply, there is too much of it. This is especially true in areas heavily visited by students, like Langdon Street and downtown. The city should continue its efforts surrounding lighting and police engagement. ASM Legislative Affairs should be pressuring them to expand those efforts. With the city budget possibly leading to less police, it is a necessity to keep a watchful eye on this situation, lest all the efforts made in this never-ending task roll back and cause even more problems.Do you know any helpful tips or tricks students could use in order to stay safe on or off campus?

Jeremy Levinger asked police officers if there were any areas on campus where sexual assaults tended to happen more frequently so police could focus in on those specific places.But Humerickhouse said Levinger’s question is difficult to answer, because statistics have shown assaults are underreported.“There’s not a single area that I would be able to point to except where there is alcohol,” Humerickhouse said.According to Humerickhouse, one difficulty police face in protecting a university campus from dangerous incidents is the constant cycling in of new students.“We have to continue to educate that frontline student to say not everyone out there is in your best interest,” he said.Buell said the tour made him realize that students are not adequately informed about sexual assault awareness.“It’s not necessarily one specific issue on campus, or issue in the Langdon Street neighborhood that we need to be focusing on,” Buell said. “It’s more [about] educating students and making them aware that there’s a lot that they can learn from the police if we collaborate with them.”ASM Chair Andrew Bulovsky said the recent surge of violence on campus sparked the idea for the Sexual Assault campaign.“It’s a way to continue to educate students so they know ‘this is what you’re supposed to do, this is what you should not do,’ so that students are at least moderately informed of how to be safe on campus,” Bulovsky said. “Really, it should be a campaign every year.”",Walking tour sheds light on campus safety for student leaders,UWM

One of the men pushed her to the ground and sexually assaulted her.Madison Police Department spokesperson Joel DeSpain said the two suspects, both 20-years-old, ran south on North Brooks Street after the woman yelled and used her knee to hit the suspect in the groin.Both suspects were white with short brown hair, six feet tall and approximately 180 pounds, according to the report. The victim told police the second suspect was not involved directly in the attack.While a very serious incident, sexual assaults by strangers are infrequent occurrences and do not happen regularly in this area, according to DeSpain.“Stranger sexual assaults are very rare,” DeSpain said. “In off-campus areas south of Regent, we often see residential burglaries and thefts.”The night after the sexual assault, a 19-year-old Madison man was long-boarding on North Brooks Street at Fahrenbrook Court when he tried to pass by a group of men who appeared to be “clean cut college-aged people,” according to DeSpain.Police said one of the men pushed the victim off his long board, causing him to crash and go unconscious.DeSpain said when the victim became conscious, he discovered the men took all the money from his wallet. He was treated for a chipped tooth and face and hand injuries.The MPD is taking steps to provide information to residents in this off-campus area to ensure students are aware of how to prevent themselves from being victimized, including sending South District community police door-to-door Wednesday with safety information for residents, DeSpain said.UW-Madison sophomore and Brooks Street resident Lauren Krupp said despite the crime in the area, she has felt safe in her apartment.“I’ve only been here for two weeks, but I’ve felt safe,” Krupp said. “I have friends in the area, so I feel safe because I know I have people I can walk with.”","Sexual assault, robbery on consecutive nights on North Brooks Street",UWM

Scott Resnick, District 8, the block party needs “grassroots support” and student planners to facilitate cooperation between various stakeholders for the party to continue.“It is a realistic nature that two weeks before finals students are going to want to have a celebration on the UW-Madison campus,” Resnick said. “I believe there are options to look at to be able to have an event that will be student-driven and student-focused.”Finding a suitable site could be a positive solution, Resnick said, but there are many options the city is glossing over, such as a sponsorship or partnership, to make a cost-effective and safe end-of-the-year celebration a reality.",Police chief calls for changes to Mifflin,UWM

The $120,000 program was funded entirely through mandatory student segregated fees.The Student Services Finance Committee, which makes recommendations on the distribution of student segregated fees on the UW-Madison campus, restored SAFEride’s funding in April, but UW Transportation Services decided to end its involvement with the program.“We informed [the Associated Students of Madison] that due to the uncertainty and lack of commitment, Transportation Services would no longer administer the cab service,” Commuter Solutions Manager Darwin Ward said in an email.SSFC originally voted to cut the cab service’s funding in March due to its declining use, but reversed its decision and restored the program’s funding shortly after many students spoke out against termination of the service.ASM Vice Chair Maria Giannopoulos said the lack of administrative involvement from Transportation Services left ASM with no choice but to discontinue the service entirely.“Transportation Services said ‘we’re not going to run the program, and we’re not going to put in our portion,’” Giannopoulos said. “So that’s where the disconnect comes in because they’re unwilling to do their part.”Giannopoulos said ASM is increasing its commitment to educating students about nighttime safety following the removal of the SAFEride cab service.“We’re looking more holistically at safety on campus,” Giannopoulos said. “We’re trying to educate people about where to walk, to stay in groups, and we’re also doing our sexual assault awareness campaign.”Ward said Transportation Services remains committed to nighttime campus safety and is looking into future improvements to its current services.“We are studying the campus bus route system for possible future improvements, and included in that study are various options for improving nighttime travel across campus as well as travel for mobility-impaired individuals,” Ward said.Transportation Services will continue its other nighttime services, SAFEwalk and SAFEride buses, in the fall.CORRECTION: The headline was changed from ""SAFEride cab program ends due to lack of funding"" to the current headline to more accurately reflect the article.",SAFEride cab program ends due to lack of administration support,UWM

Dave McCaw said the MPD will evaluate the number of arrests and citations from this weekend before calculating the final crime statistics.Ald. Scott Resnick, District 8, said he believed the environment was safer than prior years because of the police department’s zero-tolerance attitude toward ordinance violations like open intoxicants on the street, which resulted in a large number of tickets and citations.McCaw also said this year’s party was significantly less violent than last year’s event, particularly since there had been no reported sexual assaults as of Wednesday afternoon.“We’ll wait a little bit until we say we haven’t had any [sexual assaults],” McCaw said. “If we maintain this, I’ll be very pleased.”In addition to three sexual assaults at the 2011 block party, there were two stabbings and three injured police officers.McCaw said police did not use the new Nuisance Party Ordinance to break up any parties on Saturday.The ordinance, passed in late February, provides a set of guidelines police can use to use to stop and break up extraordinarily disruptive parties.Despite welcoming the safer environment, Soglin said the financial costs of the event were high because of additional police staffing and the number of citations police issued to people.“I’m satisfied with the reduction in violence and assaults,” Soglin said. “But we need to do an evaluation of the expenses.”But Resnick said the city will discuss how the event should continue in the future.“I still believe that there is still merit to the event and to having a safe event toward the end of the year,” Resnick said. “Whether that’s the Mifflin Street Block Party or something new, those are conversations that we’re going to be having for the next year.”",Soglin: Too soon to decide Mifflin’s future,UWM

Scott Walker, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and four state Senators.Activists angry over Walker’s policies, namely the massive cuts to public education and the elimination of collective bargaining for public workers, began collecting signatures late last year calling for the removal of six Republican politicians from office. By Jan. 16, they had gathered around two million petitions, initiating recall elections.Tuesday was the beginning of the end for the months-long process, as millions of voters turned out for primaries. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, winner of Tuesday’s primary for the gubernatorial race, will now face Walker June 5 in what is sure to be a heated, and expensive, election.The general elections are still a month away, but the Walker recall race is already the most expensive election in Wisconsin history; the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel estimates $42 million has already been spent.—Tyler Nickerson  2:Despite threats from Mayor Paul Soglin to cancel the Mifflin Street BlockParty over unprecedented amounts of violence at the 2011 event, the party continued this year with about 300 more arrests.Although approximately 5,000 people attended the block party this year, about 20,000 fewer people than in 2011, arrests were ten times as common.Another major change from last year is that open intoxicants were not allowed in the streets. Police also took a zero-tolerance approach to party attendees breaking city ordinances.Additionally, this year’s party was not sponsored. As a result, food vendors, entertainment groups and portable restrooms were not allowed on city sidewalks, and the street was open to traffic.The May 5 date of the event also led to students adopting the unofficial “Cinco de Mifflin” theme, resulting in custom T-shirts and costumes viewed by some, including newly formed student group “Badgers Against Racism,” as culturally insensitive.—Abby Becker  3: Ward’s funding decision leads to debateWhen Chancellor David Ward sent the final decision on the Multicultural Student Coalition’s funding to student council, many student leaders said he overstepped his bounds in his administrative role.The Student Services Finance Committee’s denial of funding for the group last fall sparked debates on campus surrounding the student group funding process, and when the group made the final appeal to Ward, group and committee members alike held their breath awaiting a decision.Ward sent the decision to student council alleging SSFC violated “viewpoint neutrality” in their initial decision, a claim the Student Judiciary and committee members refuted.Council ultimately granted MCSC funding, although SSFC members alleged the group had intentionally violated university policy.—Anna Duffin  4: Chadima allegations spur policy reviewCampus officials, including Chancellor David Ward, pledged to reevaluate UW-Madison’s off-campus alcohol policy following an alleged sexual assault by a senior athletic department official during this year’s Rose Bowl.Former associate athletic director John Chadima put his hands down a male student employee’s pants against the student’s will, according to the alleged victim.The alleged incident followed a night spent drinking with other athletic department staff in Chadima’s hotel room prior to the Rose Bowl game. The athletic department used donor funds to purchase the drinks that Chadima then offered freely to student employees, many under 21.Following the allegations, UW officials began investigating the “lack of clarification” for off-campus alcohol policies and procedures, Vice Chancellor for University Relations Vince Sweeney said.The push to examine policies came at the recommendation of investigators who reported on the allegations and called on the university to consider developing clearer guidelines regarding alcohol service to students. —Alison Bauter5: Racial motives suspected in frat incidentIndividuals on the porch of Delta Upsilon Fraternity yelled racial slurs and threw a glass bottle at two female African-American students on March 16.In the aftermath of the incident, the fraternity, one of the campus’s largest and most visible, was placed on emergency suspension by the Division of Student Life and has lost membership to the Interfraternity Council, the governing body of the university’s Greek system, for the duration of the university’s investigation into the incident.The incident, which allegedly involved fewer than five members of the fraternity, prompted a reevaluation of the university’s system for receiving and investigating reports of alleged prejudice-motivated incidents.  —Ben Siegel 6: Ward makes controversial adidas decisionThe question of how UW-Madison should handle alleged labor violations by its primary licensing partner, adidas, provoked protests, finger pointing and anger among students and administration earlier this semester.The issue began in January 2011 when a factory contracted by adidas and owned by PT Kizone abruptly shut down without paying its 2,800 unemployed workers $1.8 million in severance fees.In response, a university committee composed of student representatives,faculty and administration recommended to UW-Madison Chancellor David Ward in December that the university give adidas a 90-day ultimatum to pay the workers.But Ward surprised and disappointed the committee, called the Labor Licensing Policy Committee, when he decided to enter a 60-day period of negotiation with the company rather than give it 90 days’ notice as recommended.  Ward said mediation would give UW the best opportunity to come to an agreement with adidas and ultimately get the workers paid.The university is currently in the beginning stages of mediation.  While Ward admitted process has not moved as quickly as he would have liked, he said both parties have agreed upon a process for selecting a mediator from a panel of available retired judges.UW expects mediation to end in mid-June. —Alex DiTullio7: Courts overturn Voter ID, redistrictingWisconsin courts obstructed two major pieces of Republican legislation, annulling the voter identification law and substantially altering the state’s redistricting map earlier this semester.This spring, a Wisconsin judge froze parts of the Voter ID law, legislation that Republicans said was necessary to prevent voter fraud and Democrats rebuffed as both unnecessary and an impediment to citizens’ constitutional right to vote.The law, frozen before the state’s historic recall elections, would have required voters to show photo identification at the polls, among other stipulations.The courts also ordered Republicans to alter their second major 2011 legal maneuver, a state redistricting law that Democrats and state judges said unfairly favored Republicans in several Latino-dominated Milwaukee districts.—Alison Bauter 8: Equal Pay, abortion-related bills passAlthough budgetary and economic issues have largely dominated the discussion in the statehouse since Gov. Scott Walker took office last year, several contentious social issues briefly took center stage during the 2012 session of the state Legislature, resulting in what Democrats labeled a “war on women.”In March, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill requiring patients seeking drug-induced abortions to individually consult with a doctor before receiving the procedure. Due to uncertainty with the new law, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin decided to stop providing non-surgical abortions.Walker also signed a bill into law in April that eliminates several key provisions of the state’s Equal Pay Enforcement Act, which was enacted in 2009 in an attempt to prevent workplace discrimination.Democrats have charged that these measures are part of a larger Republican attack on women’s rights, but the GOP has argued the “war on women” is nothing more than political posturing from the Democrats ahead of the June 5 recall elections.—Adam Wollner9: Transportation cuts inspire campus debatePotential changes to transportation on campus for next year sparked heated discussion throughout the university.Students vocally opposed the Student Services Finance Committee’s decision to eliminate funding for SafeCab, a decision which the committee later overturned.Still, Transportation Services said it will no longer manage the program, leaving the university to find a way to facilitate the program.Transportation Services also is planning a 10 percent cut to campus bus routes to help it balance its budget, which is currently in a deficit.Campus community members have also opposed the bussing cuts, saying it could make campus less safe and more difficult for individuals with disabilities to maneuver.—Anna Duffin  10: After dispute, bird flu report publishedA study led by a UW-Madison researcher attracted national controversy earlier this year when a government review panel attempted to censor some of the study’s findings on the grounds of national security.The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity targeted elements of the study—illustrating the transmission of the avian flu—that described how mammals could become susceptible to the H5N1 influenza and lead to a global pandemic.In his research, Yoshihiro Kawaoka of UW-Madison’s School of Veterinary Medicine indicated that some strains of the flu found in nature need as little as four mutations to become more threatening to humans than previously thought.The study was eventually published in its entirety May 3.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/05/the-dirty-bird-farewell-and-keep-it-class-badgers,"May 2, 2012 | 6:41pm CDT","I started writing the sex column first at the Badger Herald and then at The Daily Cardinal. I was an undergrad. It was 2008. I started writing because I thought I had a lot of training and knowledge I could share on subjects about which training and knowledge weren’t always readily accessible. I wasn’t sure how well the column would be received, and I certainly didn’t expect to be writing for several years. The reason I did is because of you. Students wrote in with their own questions and issues. Some weeks, I had more e-mails than I had time to answer. I made referrals, sent private e-mails and published some columns for the paper. I like to think I made a difference, and I like to think people learned from me.But really, what kept me checking my inbox is what I learned from you. I learned about sex, I learned about people and I learned about myself. I’ve thought many times that the sex columnist should be someone younger (I’m 25, which may or may not seem old to you, but trust that when you’re this age and you see/hear all the undergrads gearing up for Mifflin, you will feel old as hell), sexier, more in touch with campus, but I just couldn’t give it up—you all are so interesting, so inspiring, so amazing.I learned sex is important. Of course, I always knew this, and that’s why I started writing—but you crystallized just how much sex matters. When we have sex (or when we choose not to), we can learn, teach, give, receive, love, lust, express, explore, laugh, cry, open, close, release, validate, respect, subvert, enjoy, connect, share, create, stop.Tell me that’s not important. Tell me that doesn’t matter. Tell it to the women who’ve never had orgasms who write to me worried something is wrong with them. Tell it to the men who have found out their partners have histories of sexual assault, who write to me worried they aren’t supporting them the way they deserve to be supported. Tell it to the students questioning their sexual identities, their sexual desires and their sexual relationships, who write to me telling me they’ve never told anyone this before.I learned to pick my battles. The vast majority of correspondence I receive is positive, curious and authentic. I love checking my e-mail. However, sometimes I get feedback from people who are “very, very against” my “ignorant, ill-informed” column, which is responsible for the “moral decline” of campus (and probably the universe) into the “ugly feminist” throes of “abortion, homosexuality and pornagraphy.” Slutty, slut, whore, bitchcunt, slut.This used to really bug me. But you know, there are two types of people in the world: reasonable people and Glenn Grothman. I realized the time I spent dealing with the Grothmans of the world was time I wasn’t spending doling out fornication advice to slutty unmarried homo abortionists. And if no one had time to teach the sluts, then the terrorists had already won.I learned what I believe in. Even though I learned to ignore the rare BS that did show up, I found there are some things that I can’t let go. That’s why, sprinkled in with blowjob pointers, STI info and anal tips, you’ll also find disgust for Pro-Life Wisconsin’s lies about emergency contraception, critique of elected officials who pass legislation harmful to the health of Wisconsin citizens and outrage over the campus climate surrounding sexual assault. You taught me what matters, what I believe, why I believe it and how to defend it.I learned how to be a better lover. I don’t always know the answers to the questions people ask. Often, I have an idea of where to start, but then I start thinking, “Hm. I wonder if this would work.” And then it’s time for research. Sometimes that research comes from a book, a class, an expert or sometimes from my bedroom. I don’t keep a lab notebook next to my bed, but you prompted me to think, experiment, problem-solve and try new things. I practiced asking my partners (bless their ever-so-patient, understanding hearts) to experiment, problem-solve and try new things. I practiced communicating about desires, boundaries, expectations and pleasure.In short, dear readers, you have inspired me to do all of the things I hope I have inspired you to do. So thank you, my fellow Badgers, for joining me on this crazy, sexy journey. Whether you regarded my column as frivolous entertainment, useful advice or distasteful garbage, reading and writing for you has been a humbling honor and a genuine pleasure.

The conversation about this pervasive problem has been constructive and enlightening, and it would be a shame to see this open kind of discussion go away once the issue is out of the limelight. April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, but dedicating one month to sexual assault is not enough to mitigate the problem, and this campus needs to find a way to keep the conversation going year round.Local and student organizations like Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment have done an amazing job at educating students on sexual assault, but that responsibility should not be left entirely up to them. The university has an obligation to address sexual and gendered issues as well, and on a broader scale than they have thus far. It is for this reason this Editorial Board is in favor of a Gender and Women’s Studies course requirement for all UW-Madison undergraduates.Some time ago, the university decided rightly that a well-rounded education would be incomplete without the study of minority and underrepresented groups and the challenges they face in society. The ethnic studies requirement has certainly not eliminated the problems of discrimination on campus, but it was a proactive step forward in bringing race into the conversation and exposing students to groups and issues they would not have otherwise considered within disciplines they already study. Our hope is that a Gender and Women’s Studies requirement would function in the same way.Like the ethnic studies requirement, we hope that the university will use this as a first step rather than an end in itself. This campus has a wealth of resources for the study of gender and race in society and some of the top scholars on those subjects. It would be a shame to limit that educational experience to a few departments. Each academic department should also take it upon itself to incorporate diverse perspectives into their curriculums when it is possible.The university never fails to react to issues of sexual assault or discrimination on this campus when there is an incident; where it lacks is in the prevention of such occurrences from happening in the first place. It may not eliminate these issues in our community, but one course can make the difference in enlightening undergraduates on gendered issues and changing the perspectives of otherwise apathetic students.What do you think of adding a gender and women’s studies requirement?

In an address to the crowd, Karen Johnson, the regional director of NOW, applauded Men Stopping Rape, which sponsored the rally, for their work.Another member of NOW said they wanted to show respect to the men for their actions. Geared toward changing men’s attitudes toward rape, many of the rally’s speakers expressed their thanks for the women’s support. At the rally, various speakers discussed the goals of the organization, which include increasing community awareness of rape and sexual assault, and expressed hope for change. Issues included coping not only with rape, but with sexual harassment of both men and women. Several speakers also referred positively to the changing attitudes of people, and condemned Gov. Tommy Thompson for vetoing a sexual assault education bill. As bystanders looked on, the group marched, chanting, “No more date rape.” Upon returning to the Capitol, the organizers handed out candles and settled in a circle for the speak-out in which female and male survivors of rape and sexual assault shared their experiences, some shedding tears. Sam Day, a long-time Madison civil rights activist, who attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said things are in fact changing. He added that when he was a student at the UW, rape and sexual harassment were accepted, and not  uncommon between professors and students who wanted “to make the grade.” As the end of the march, participants stood in a circle, holding hands, and ending with the line, “We are 50 people working and living to end rape.”",Delving into the archives: Rally against rape held,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/04/still-not-crazy-about-running,"April 29, 2012 | 8:38pm CDT","For those of you who read my column on a weekly basis (and I thank all three of you kindly), you may recall my voicing a passionate disdain for physical activity. To directly quote my eloquent self, “Exercising sucks balls. Jogging is for masochists and people who hate themselves.” I am unsure of what this says about me—whether I suffer from self-esteem issues or have simply undergone a change of heart—but this weekend I took part in Madison’s annual Crazylegs Classic. The five-mile race was going to be tough for a number of reasons. The first: I am by no means a runner, and while I have made a point over the last two months to spend more early mornings jogging around town, I have yet to reach the point where running feels effortless, let alone enjoyable, though I am unsure that second possibility exists. Additionally, I woke up on Saturday with a sore throat and stuffy nose. An obnoxiously clingy bug has been making its way around the Cardinal office since the editorial staff’s return from spring break, and apparently the morning of my first race was when it decided to slap me across the face. Still, I had paid $35 to essentially get in my day’s workout, so I was not going to let what little money I have go to waste. Having said that, I had a hard time reconciling with the fact that my dollars were not going toward some noble effort like cancer research or hunger relief, but instead the UW Athletic Department. Seriously? Of all the corners of campus, I have to assume the one that has the easiest time getting its hands on some cash is the athletic department. I tried not to dwell on this unfortunate reality for too long. Motivating myself to run five miles was already hard. Motivating myself to run five miles for the benefit of a department whose director publicly doubted the claims of a sexual assault victim was even harder.   My friends and I made our way up to the Capitol just before the race’s 10 a.m. start. It was there we learned the worst part of Crazylegs was not the running: It was waiting around for the damn thing to start. As you likely noticed, Madison was cold and rainy on Saturday. While those dreary weather conditions are less than ideal for running five miles, they are even less ideal for waiting in anticipation of running five miles. You know your circumstances are bad when running five miles seems preferable to standing around. While we joined our heat at 10, we would not hear the words “Your Crazylegs starts now!” until 10:45. When we finally were put in motion, things seemed to be going well. Robyn was singing me on, my friend and fellow runner was setting a doable but challenging pace and running up Observatory did not result in my immediate collapse—always a plus. But then there was the halfway point. As Kelly Clarkson’s “Stronger” blasted through my earbuds, I felt what I assumed was a raindrop of especially noteworthy girth fall onto my sweatshirt sleeve. I looked down to check, and found that it was not water than had fallen from the sky, but feces. Literally, I cannot make this shit up. A bird decided while hovering right above me that now was the opportune moment to relieve itself. Perhaps I was drawing too much attention with my bright yellow sweatshirt, but the droppings actually managed to distract me from what a miserable time running is, and for that I am truly grateful.     As the markers for miles three and four passed by, the finish line somehow felt further and further away. As I ran past my apartment in the final mile, it took everything I had not to throw my hands up and proclaim, “Forget this. I’m making myself some cocoa!” Still, as I crossed the finish line and felt the Camp Randall grass beneath my feet, my senior nostalgia overrode any type of exhaustion I could muster. It was one more accomplishment I had made throughout my college career, likely one of the last ones I will have. I have yet to fully sway from my position that jogging is the brainchild of Satan, but when you come in 7,612th place, you have to be at least a little proud of yourself.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/04/opening-the-sexual-assault-conversation,"April 26, 2012 | 2:35am CDT","During Sexual Assault Awareness Month, this three-part Daily Cardinal series delves into the numbers, spotlights available resources and expands the conversation to reflect the real impact of sexual assault at UW-Madison.In 1992, Jaclyn Friedman attended an undergraduate campus party. She tried to keep up as her friends took shots and pounded beers. Soon, she was much drunker than she planned, and went back to her room to go to bed. A male acquaintance followed her, entered her room and raped her.According to a report from UW-Madison’s Dean of Students office, cases like these—involving alcohol and an acquaintance—describe the majority of the 123 sexual assaults reported by students between 2010 and 2011.But statistics and stories like these capture only the basic elements of a crime that impacts the entire campus community.The Dean’s Office report does not list the victim’s gender, but Assistant Dean of Students Tonya Schmidt reported at least a small percentage of disclosures come from male victims, as well as those identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.Suddenly, the story becomes more complex, and experts like Schmidt say barriers to an already underreported crime multiply and important conversations become constrained by gendered language.‘Both realities are true’Twenty years after her assault, Friedman is a speaker, author and activist who lectures on college campuses nationwide about ending sexual violence and the underlying cultural assumptions that facilitate it. Many laud her as an expert whose views challenge accepted thinking on sexual assault.For Friedman, it is easier to center the difficult, nuanced discussion of sexual violence on familiar scenarios—male aggressor, female victim—but she acknowledges this approach does not always provide room for different “realities.”“We have to talk about the social phenomenon being gendered while also making sure we make space for the reality that anyone can be a victim of sexual violence and anyone can be a perpetrator,” Friedman told The Daily Cardinal following a recent UW-Madison appearance.According to Friedman’s presentation, almost 99 percent of perpetrators are male but only 85 percent of victims are female.The statistics are approximate, Friedman cautioned, because the barriers presented by sexual assault against men makes the issue uniquely taboo.“Male victims of sexual violence are sexualized as female,” she explained. “The idea is that not only has their body been violated in this profound way, but their masculinity has been violated.”Each year, about one case of male-against-male sexual assault is addressed through the Dean of Students office, according to Schmidt.Feelings of emasculation and vulnerability pose barriers to reporting assaults, Schmidt said, because it forces men to confront a difficult question: “How do I tell somebody that I’ve been victimized? I’m male. I should have been able to stop this.”Friedman summarizes it as the “additional admission that ‘I’m supposed to be strong and invulnerable in this culture, and yet somebody did this to me.’”Additionally, male victims who identify as straight may fear being labeled or stigmatized as homosexual. For victims who do identify as gay, lesbian or transgender, these complications increase.‘A lot of emotions, a lot of anger’A few years ago, two roommates threw a party in their dorm room. At the end of the night, both were heavily intoxicated. One of the men was exploring his sexuality and tried to engage with his roommate, but went “too far.”“The roommate came forward because he was so traumatized by what happened to him,” said Schmidt, who received the report at the Dean of Students Office.Schmidt described the situation as “a really difficult phase” because while the perpetrator was struggling with questions about his own sexuality, he got in trouble for “going too far with it.”“There was a lot of emotions, a lot of anger,” Schmidt recalled. “There was a lot at stake, there was a lot lost.”For victims of assault who identify as LGBT or question their sexuality, fear of being “outed” or confronting difficult personal questions creates a “double-bind,” according to Friedman.“[LGBT individuals] are taught from a young age that everything we want in our sex-lives is icky and wrong and taboo,” she explained. “When someone does something to us that feels wrong, sometimes it’s hard to name that because we feel like everything is wrong. Queer desire is supposed to be wrong.”Robin Matthies, assistant director at UW-Madison’s LGBT Campus Center, said victims should consider the Center a safe space to share stories and start finding resources they need, although staffers are not trained to counsel victims.Matthies described LGBT sexual assaults as “going somewhat invisible on campus,” adding that media and the campus community should “spread awareness… by getting the word out there that this is something that needs to be addressed.”‘A big project’Last fall, Jon Hersch sat down in Social Work 672 with 20 fellow fraternity members to talk about issues surrounding campus sexual assault. The class, “Greek Men for Violence Prevention”, was more “intimate” than a lecture or discussion section; it provided a chance to “just talk about the issues.”“That’s when I started to really realize how violence prevention… should not be viewed as a gendered effort,” Hersch said. “It’s not a woman’s fight—it’s a cultural travesty.”Now PAVE’s finance and office coordinator, Hersch encourages male involvement through the campus group and from within the Greek community.“It’s really important for more men to become engaged and really try to challenge their fellow man to come to the realization that they’re not entitled to own women,” he said. “Or to own each other, for that matter.”Expanding community engagement and education surrounding all sexual assaults is “a big project,” said Friedman, and creating space within that conversation to break down barriers and include all realities of sexual assault starts by changing basic perceptions.“We have to undo the assumption that there’s a particular way the power dynamic should go and there’s a particular gender to that, and that will undo all of these taboos.”",Opening the sexual assault conversation,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/04/with-initiative-campus-groups-come-together-to-support-sexual-assault-victims,"April 24, 2012 | 1:44am CDT","Every Tuesday afternoon, the Campus Women’s Center closes its doors to the public so survivors of sexual assault can come together to heal.The center is just one participant in campus-wide initiative End Violence On Campus, which works in coalition with student and community groups to end sexual assault, dating violence and stalking on campus.Campus groups part of EVOC are also working to prevent sexual violence to foster a climate where victims feel more comfortable disclosing and reporting sexual assault.Gethsemane Herron, the center’s support services coordinator, said when groups coordinate together it is easier for survivors, whose experiences are so different, to find solace where they feel most comfortable.“There are so many ways to be a woman. Not only can very different groups come together but they can work together for a common goal and find commonality with this diverseness,” Herron said.If a victim discloses an incident of sexual assault to a university employee, the employee is required to anonymously report the incident to the Dean of Students. The details and people involved in the incident are not disclosed.But it is fully the victim’s choice whether or not they want to take further legal action by filing a report with the Dean of Students or the City of Madison Police Department.“When a student has been victimized, our role is to help give them some power back,” said University Housing Associate Director Kay Reuter-Krohn. Helping survivors come to their own conclusions about what they need is part of that.Reuter-Krohn said it is even more important for student groups like PAVE and the Campus Women’s Center to be present on campus because disclosing can be difficult for victims. They help victims know it is okay to be unsure of what actions they should take.“It’s a journey making the right decision.  Nobody can tell the victim what the right decision is,” Reuter-Krohn said.PAVE, in addition to helping survivors decide on whether or not to report, offers a safe space for students to discuss sexual violence. Through programming often in conjunction with groups like CWC or Sex Out Loud, they raise awareness about the nature of sexual assault and the misconceptions that surround it.For PAVE Chair Val Kowis, the UW community can best address preventing sexual assault by understanding it affects all members of campus.“Sexual violence is a community problem, so we all must shoulder some responsibility and be involved in the process for change to happen.”Neither PAVE members nor house fellows are trained to counsel victims that disclose to them. Individuals in both groups can help victims connect with services they need.The work EVOC is doing is not limited to student groups. The initiative also helps streamline how administrative offices, like the Center for the First Year Experience, frame public safety information to incoming students.After studies showed students usually did not retain violence prevention messages from Student Orientation, Advising and Registration, Carren Martin, the orientation’s assistant director, said they are trying more effective ways address students.In years past, a University Health Services employee and UW police officer lectured students about safety on campus. This year, SOAR student leaders will weave violence prevention topics into broader discussions about building positive communities.“Students hearing things from other students can have a really powerful impact,” Martin said.Martin emphasized they will be focusing on “extending” orientation throughout the year using social media to complement events.“If you’re not following [SOAR programming] up with a lot of careful things throughout the Fall … you potentially missed a lot of people and a lot of opportunity,” Martin said.Martin said she hopes collaboration throughout the university community shows students they can have a part in ending sexual assault on campus.“Because this is a large decentralized campus that’s why connections … are so important to try to help people understand that it is a bigger campus issue and movement rather than the responsibility of one place,” Martin said.","With initiative, campus groups come together to support sexual assault victims",UWM

It has steadily spread to countries all over the world such as Australia, India, Canada and most of Europe.“Take Back the Night” has been at UW-Madison since 1989.This year’s event largely focused on sexual assault survivors and their continued struggle to end the violence. According to Julia Gutierrez, the Take Back the Night planning committee chair, 1 out of 6 American women have been victims of attempted or completed rape in their lifetime.As the sun set, participants formed a circle and some of the women came forward to share their own, relatives or friends’ experiences at a candlelight vigil and speak-out held atop Bascom Hill. As the vigil progressed, the circle grew larger and more people joined.“I want to remind us all that we are here doing ‘Take Back the Night’ to honor survivors, to give a space for survivors to speak out,” Violence Prevention Communications Coordinator Stephen Montagna said. “We have this movement because of survivors.”Keynote speaker Molly Herrmann also discussed the perils of sexual assault within the LGBT community and the myths surrounding it. According to Herrmann, the violence takes place more often than people realize, because many within that community fear speaking out will cause additional harm.“Sexual assault often involves shame and fear for survivors,” she said. “This is no different for LGBT people. LGBT are unlikely to tell mainstream providers for fear about how disclosure of sexual orientation or gender identity will be handled.”While the event focused on victims of sexual assault all around the world, UW-Madison junior Sarah Lensmire said it happens on campus more often than most students realize.“[Sexual assault] does happen. And it happens to your friends and it happens to your sisters and that there are things that we can do,” Lensmier said. “There are steps you can take and there are ways to help.”",‘Take Back the Night’ brings awareness of sexual assault,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/04/letter-sexual-assault-an-unseen-war-in-the-military,"April 18, 2012 | 6:01pm CDT"," Currently, there are over 1.5 million people in the U.S. Military who are on active duty.  It is their job to fight for our country to keep us safe from harm.  However, it is now time that we step up for the safety of our armed forces.Sexual assault is a growing problem in the military with no end in sight.  In a 622-page report published by the Department of Defense, a staggering 3,158 total instances of sexual assault were reported—but that is just the beginning.  The DoD believes that number only makes up 13.5 percent of the actual number of sexual assaults in the military in 2010.  A better, more accurate estimate would be closer to 19,000 sexual assaults. To put that number in perspective, that is about half of the UW-Madison student body and a little more than the population of Middleton.With April being Sexual Assault Awareness Month, this issue has been brought under especially bright lights during the last couple of weeks, but it should be an issue we think about and address all year long.  Civilians looking out for the safety of our military personnel cannot be reserved for one month of the year.It is for that reason I am happy to say this phenomenon has increasingly been at the forefront of news coverage, with many veterans speaking up about what they experienced or witnessed during their service. It was also the topic of a recent Sundance film, “The Invisible War” by Kirby Dick. Some of the film’s featured statistics help to paint a vivid picture of what is really occurring in the armed forces:A female serving for the United States of America is more likely to be sexually assaulted by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire. This is unreal. When soldiers enlist, they know they are taking a risk and putting their safety in jeopardy, but it is supposed to be the enemy, not your fellow soldiers, making that the case.Citing glaring statistics like these, the intention of “The Invisible War” was to make an impact on law enforcement system.  Only 8 percent of known sexual assault cases in the military are prosecuted.  Over 90 percent of the sexual assaults reported are result in no form of punishment for the perpetrator. Additionally, only 2 percent of known sexual assault cases result in convictions. Finally, of the 19,000 estimated cases of sexual assault that happened in the armed forces in 2010, only 62 led to the punishment of an offender.At this point in history, it is estimated that 500,000 people who are or have served in the military have been sexually assaulted. They may not be able to convict their attackers, but that does not mean there is nothing to be done. We can bring this issue to light. We can make it known that there is a battle our soldiers are fighting not against the perceived enemy, but within their own military communities. This battle is sexual assault.PAVE is a student organization dedicated to ending sexual assault, dating violence and stalking in the UW-Madison community through education and activism.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/04/reported-sexual-assaults-up,"April 17, 2012 | 1:21am CDT","During Sexual Assault Awareness Month, this three-part Daily Cardinal series delves into the numbers, spotlights available resources and expands the conversation to reflect the real impact of sexual assault at UW-Madison.Since 2009, the number of sexual assaults reported by UW-Madison students nearly tripled. According to Assistant Dean of Students Tonya Schmidt, that increase is a good thing.“It means that the victims are getting help for themselves, and that’s the most important thing,” Schmidt said, but added the numbers do not necessarily tell the “real story.”As Schmidt explained, increased reports do not mean more sexual assaults are occurring, but that more students are disclosing a typically underreported crime.“This isn’t about numbers, this is about victims getting the support they need after a very traumatic incident,” she said.Schmidt credits the increased reporting to the efforts of campus groups working in coalition with Ending Violence On Campus, an initiative designed to combine local resources to end instances of sexual assault, dating violence and stalking on campus.EVOC works with campus groups to dispel myths preventing students from reporting sexual assault, including the misconception that they could be charged for underage drinking and the tendency for victims to blame themselves, rather than the perpetrator.When the initiative began in 2009, students reported 45 sexual assaults on campus. In 2010, that number more than doubled to 112. In the past year, the Dean of Students Office said there have been 123 instances of sexual assault reported by UW-Madison students.Still, Val Kowis, chair of student group Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment, agreed the increased reports do not tell the whole story of sexual assault at UW-Madison.“When I look at it, I think about the fact that one in four women will experience sexual assault during her time at college,” Kowis said. “We’re not seeing nearly close to those numbers being reported.”Kowis hopes the relative uptick in numbers means students are more aware of campus resources available and are not falling for the “myths” she said prevent many from reporting.“It’s that whole mindset that you could’ve done more,” Kowis said. “All those victim-blaming questions: Why did you drink so much? Why did you walk alone? Why did you go to a party with him? The societal attitudes are some of the biggest barriers by far.”Carmen Hotvedt, a violence prevention specialist for EVOC, has been working to dispel myths like these for over 15 years.According to her, societal attitudes lead victims to blame themselves, rather than their assailant, especially if the perpetrator is an acquaintance.According to the Dean of Students Office, 71 of the 123 victims in 2011 knew their assailant.While the term “date rape” was once used to describe such assaults, Hotvedt said this generation of college students rarely dates in the traditional sense of the term. “Acquaintances” are usually just that, a friend of a friend or even someone loosely connected to a friend.“’Acquaintance’ is something that’s loosely defined. But there’s still a sense of trust when someone brings you a drink or you have a 20-minute conversation,” she said.EVOC, PAVE and UHS emphasize to victims they should not blame themselves even if the perpetrator was an acquaintance, date, friend or even a significant other or individual with whom they had been sexually intimate previously.Whether or not the victim knew their assailant, students are significantly less likely to report assaults if they had been drinking, Kowis said, calling it a “huge barrier” for victims to overcome.Fifty-six of the reported assaults in 2011 involved alcohol, according to the Dean of Students Office. Historically, about half of reported cases involve drinking.Both Schmidt and Kowis said many students are wary of using campus resources because they fear retribution for drinking underage. But as Schmidt explained, that assumption is “a misnomer.”According to the university’s Responsible Action Guidelines, if a student discloses drinking underage while reporting an assault to anyone on campus, including the University of Wisconsin Police Department, the drinking ticket and disciplinary process will be waived, and no mention of alcohol-related misconduct will go on the student’s record.“There’s a bigger crime out there, and underage drinking isn’t it,” Hotvedt said.Most importantly, both victims and those in the community commonly misconstrue what the crime of sexual assault actually is, she said.“Sexual assault’s really defined by consent. Did the perpetrator get consent or not?” Hotvedt explained. “It’s not defined by the perpetrator’s use of force, which is how I think our culture wants us to think about it.”Throughout the coming month, PAVE will work to dispel myths and raise awareness about sexual assault on campus.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/04/profits-self-policing-can-save-mifflin,"April 15, 2012 | 9:09pm CDT","Compared to the 2009 and 2010 Mifflin Street block parties, which were hazily remembered but mostly calm affairs, last year’s celebration was out of control. Although there were fewer arrests last year than in 2010, there were more than 20 trips to detox, three injured officers, three sexual assaults and two stabbings. I love reveling alongside my fellow students but Mifflin needs to be a party where everyone can go have fun and not get stabbed, so some changes need to be made.Given the variety of interests involved in Mifflin, it is hard to separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of ideas to help the party. Since trying to quash the party would be nearly impossible, and moving the event also seems unlikely, Mifflin is even more complicated. Some people have suggested bringing in socially active speakers or non-profit booths, but making Mifflin boring is the most limp-wristed approach possible and any type of pacifying effect will be temporary.This year, the Mifflin police force, with some more horseback units than years past, will be strictly enforcing the laws. But over-enforcement will reap no long-term benefits either, and it will only anger the students who are still standing after they receive their tickets. Mayor Paul Soglin has said the city needs to “thread the needle” in terms of Mifflin. He is correct, but restraining the party hardly indicates the deftness of his metaphor.I have many fond memories of Mifflin, and I think that the party is important to a campus that is extremely proud of its work-hard-play-hard reputation. So what should be done to save the beloved party? Mifflin will only be saved by the love students have for it, and that love needs to be expressed through new ideas before Madison police and residents slowly kill it off. Here are a few ideas.Mifflin needs to be treated as more ordinary, and people will act more ordinary. To start, Madison should embrace the balmy anarchism of the party and let it get really weird by removing the vast majority of the police presence. Removing the cops will force students to keep their wits because there will be no cops to whisk them away if things get out of control. That means fewer inebriated belligerence and fewer stabbings. There is no certainty that increasing police presence can stop freak occurrences like the two stabbings last year. The only answer is having students police themselves, which is what happens the rest of the time when it is not the first Saturday in May. Since there still needs to be a police presence, why not use a system of either mounted or radio-controlled video surveillance supported by fewer officers on the ground? This vision of Mifflin is admittedly dystopian and possibly more dangerous for the first year, but forcing students to monitor themselves will stifle some of the assaults and trips to detox that Mifflin can produce in the long run.My second idea is inspired by a trip to Osh-kosh’s spring bar crawl. Although the bar-crawl is hardly comparable to Mifflin in terms of scale or environment, Madison could learn from the bi-annual event. The entire bar-crawl is oriented towards profit-maximization. The local bars, police officers on duty and police officers paid to do security worked in tandem to keep the event fun and fluid. The profit incentive has always been missing from Mifflin, so other than the occasional sponsor, organizations do not really have any interest in helping regulate the behavior of party-goers. This is why Halloween sees only a fraction of arrests compared to Mifflin. On Halloween, everyone is just trying to make a buck, and that means keeping underage-drinking, violence and over-drunkenness to a minimum. I don’t want to see Mifflin be turned into Halloween, but by bringing in beer-vendors, food-carts and other businesses, more people will have a vested interest in Mifflin as a whole, as opposed to just being interested in getting their drunk on.If these ideas don’t sound great to you, I urge you to think about how Mifflin can be changed for the better. And hopefully 20 years from now a bunch of Wiconsinites will still keep the first Saturday in May sacred by shotgunning nasty beer and swilling cheap vodka.David Ruiz is a senior majoring in English.

I would question a lot of what was said,” Alvarez told the State Journal.Alvarez’s comments came in response to a second report released by UW, detailing findings regarding the alleged sexual assault by Chadima. Alvarez apologized to Bayrd and the victim in a letter.“First, I’d like to apologize if I offended anyone—including the alleged victim—with my comments regarding the allegations of misconduct,” Alvarez wrote in the letter to Bayrd as reported by the State Journal.In her letter to Ward and Alvarez that prompted the apology, Bayrd criticized Alvarez for making fun of a victim who she said acted responsibly in a dangerous situation.“It is acceptable for Alvarez to have a personal opinion as to the accuracy of the accusation, but it is not appropriate for Alvarez to bully the alleged victim for ‘not being man enough’ by locking himself in a closet,” she said.Bayrd also said she felt Alvarez’s comments could deter future victims from reporting sexual assault because they would risk being mocked.“The message Alvarez sends to future victims is clear—don’t report a sexual assault or risk being made fun of.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/03/magnino-for-dane-county-board,"March 28, 2012 | 9:50pm CDT"," As John Magnino and Leland Pan face off for a seat on the Dane County Board, both claim they will bring the student voice to the little-known governmental body. The Daily Cardinal appreciates both candidates’ perceived need for student input at the county level. We want someone with practical ideas to champion campus causes. We need a representative to expand student input further than their one seat. And we want someone to do this while promoting a positive student image. Magnino is that candidate.Magnino recognizes what are truly student issues. As a UW tour guide, Magnino said the biggest concern prospective students and their families voice is student safety. With muggings and sexual assaults headlining our paper every week, this issue’s importance is undeniable. While mainly a city issue that is out of the county’s jurisdiction, Magnino identified where the county can assist in making our campus safer. Noting the infamous murder of student Brittany Zimmermann,  Magnino believes one way the board could help is to improve the current county-run police dispatch system that is often accused of failing to help Brittany. Magnino also noted the importance of the drug court as a way to prosecute non-violent crimes in a humane, effective manner.While we admire Pan’s idealism and fiery activism, his platform issues do not align with his goal to “empower the student voice.” As a member of the Dane County Board, Pan said he would focus on the environment, protecting undocumented workers and anti-privatization. While Pan’s goals are well-intentioned and thought out, they are more aligned with public sector unions, WISPIRG, Student Labor Action Coalition and other leftist student groups, but not the student body as a whole.Magnino has concrete plans to institutionalize the student voice within the county board by creating a Joint City-County-Campus Committee. The committee, consisting of city alders, student representatives and other campus stakeholders, would serve as an open forum to address student issues. Furthermore, Magnino would promote the student voice by having more student voices on county committees.If both candidates want the student voice taken more seriously at the county level, they must also be taken seriously as individuals. Pan has a track record of posting vulgar Facebook statuses about campus officials and setting a profile picture of himself holding defaced campaign signs while making suggestive gestures. Although Pan regrets his past actions, we worry he is not mature enough for the position. If we wish to instill a serious student perspective on the board, we cannot risk electing someone who may trivialize students by lashing out at a disagreeable board member.In a race where seemingly no students even know what the sought-after position does, one major step to empowering the student voice is by clueing them into why the Dane County Board matters in the first place. Magnino plans—and has already started—to reach across campus to engage a diverse population of students from the Greek community to College Republicans to the Queer Law Society. With plans to work extensively with WISPIRG and other campus activist groups, Pan would mobilize no more than the campus’s usual suspects.Considering his pragmatic approach to tackling student issues and his right personality to promote a healthy public discourse, The Daily Cardinal endorses John Magnino for Dane County Board, District 5.Who do you think deserves a seat on the Dane County Board?

The incident sparked a small, but passionate, student-led protest on ZBT’s property, at which eight students were eventually arrested.Twenty-four years later, Multicultural Student Coalition Executive Member Althea Miller said Langdon Street continues to be a hotbed for racist incidents, pointing to a recent report of students yelling racial slurs from a fraternity balcony and throwing a bottle at two African American students.The most recent incident at Delta Upsilon came eight months after residents of a Langdon Street apartment hung a black Spider-Man doll from a balcony, an act some students said resembled a lynching. Miller said she sees the two incidents as part of a trend.“There’s a really huge issue with Langdon Street because things keep happening on Langdon Street,” Miller said. “Quite frankly I’m getting sick of it.”While former interfraternity council vice president and Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity member Tom Templeton recognizes a pattern of racial issues within Greek life, he said such problems are not exclusive to fraternity row.“I think it is easy to target and label Langdon Street and the Greek community because of our self-affiliated labeling and the fact that we are kind of a tight-knit community,” Templeton said. “But at the same time there have been racial issues across campus since the same time outside of the Greek community.”Still, Templeton said he recognizes a need for change. He said he views the recent incident at DU as an opportunity to shed light on the reoccurring issue, hoping it will lead to the Greek community working with programs or initiatives to prevent such problems from happening in the future.With a similar goal in mind, Miller suggested diversity training for Greek life affiliates, an idea that Templeton said is conceivable.“We do new member education programs for alcohol related issues and sexual assault,” he said. “I think diversity is another one that all new members in the Greek community would benefit from.”African American Studies Professor Michael Thornton also said he sees a trend in racist occurrences on Langdon Street, a trend he attributes to high alcohol consumption within Greek life.“When you have a lot of people in fraternities for example, you have a lot more people in concentrated areas,” Thornton said. “And if there’s drinking, they’re more likely to have the potential for acting inappropriately.”But Templeton said it is unfair to single out Greek life when most students outside of Langdon culture drink as well.","Fraternity member, multicultural student leader look to end racist incidents on Langdon Street",UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/03/the-dirty-bird-safety-tip-for-spring-break-dont-be-a-rapist,"March 21, 2012 | 8:19pm CDT","I’m not a UW student, but I have a daughter who is… I have read some of your pieces and have been impressed by both the intelligence and bravery evident in your writing… My daughter is going on a spring break trip this year, and I would like to see a hip, common-sense guide to spring break safety that she and other girls can depend on… I think you would be a good person to write such an article, and that’s why I’m sending this email… Thanks for continuing to write your articles. I’m glad UW has resources like this available for its students.—Badger MomBadger Mom, yours is a lovely email both in its intention and in its wording. However, while I am flattered and grateful, I don’t think I can do what I think you’re asking me to do. I get the distinct sense that what you’re looking for is the kind of “Watch your drink! Don’t go home with strange boys! Wear sunscreen!” article that tends to come around every year around spring break. But let’s be real. Those are really unhelpful safety tips (except sunscreen, sunscreen is very important and everyone should wear it all of the time). Every girl knows she should watch her drink, walk with a friend and blah blah blah. No “safety tip” I could possibly provide would be anything that any of us hasn’t heard a bazillion times before, and if those helpful tips were all it took to prevent rape, well, shit, that would be awesome.But it isn’t. There are no inherent differences between the chick who has an amazing spring break having a shit ton of hot sex with the gorgeous stranger she just met and the chick who drifts in and out of consciousness while the rapist who deliberately got her that drunk in the first place assaults her. The first girl is not smarter, the second girl is not less socially savvy. Maybe the first girl watched her drink, maybe she didn’t. Maybe the second girl did, maybe she didn’t. The difference is the rapist.Think about the drunkest you ever got. Since I have no sense of boundaries or propriety, I’ll use myself as an example. I wasn’t on spring break, but I found out I got into med school on a Saturday. As a foolhardy undergrad, I went to the place nearest my house that had a lot of cheap liquor—Wando’s. Fishbowls were consumed. Random people bought me shots and congratulated me. If you must know, I was wearing jeans, a cute purple top, and for reasons I can no longer recall, pearls. I stumbled out at bartime, ebullient about my sparkling professional future, slurring and maybe crying a little bit about how I was gonna be the BEST DOCTOR EVER.I didn’t watch my drinks for most of the night. I accepted drinks from strangers. I hugged and high-fived boys I didn’t know. I smiled and laughed and told them all about myself. I went to the bathroom alone multiple times. I walked home on a dark side street with my male Ochem lab partner howling, “OMG I’m so DRUNK how did I get this DRUNK. FUCK.” I got what I deserved that night: A couple hours snuggling with the toilet bowl and a hangover that kept me in bed until 7 p.m. the following day. I dare you to tell me I deserved anything else. I dare you to tell any person who is raped—and did exactly the same things you, I or any one of a thousand other people who didn’t get raped that night did—that they deserved it.This is why “safety tips” are a sham. Safety tips get trotted out as an example of how people who are assaulted deserved it or did it to themselves. Safety tips are used to justify sexual assault, as though the appropriate punishment for having too much to drink is getting raped. Safety tips get held up as a kind of rape life preserver when we want to believe it won’t happen to us. Every day of spring break, there will be people who do everything “wrong” and are still not assaulted. Every day of spring break, there will be people who do everything “right” and are still assaulted. Except when we rely on “safety tips” and are assaulted anyway, there is always something that we could have, should have, and should have not done to have prevented it.When we rely on “safety tips,” it is impossible to do everything right. So, my spring break safety guide consists of this: Don’t fucking rape people. If you have sex with a chick who is too drunk to say no, you are not “scoring,” you are not “getting lucky”: you are a rapist. If you use alcohol in order to get people to do things you think they might not do if they were sober, you are not cool or slick or clever: You are a rapist. If you don’t bother to get consent, but you figure this person would “totally want it anyway” because you are hot or an athlete or in law school or whatever, then you’re a rapist. And you suck.E-mail Erica at sex@dailycardinal.com.","The Dirty Bird: ""Safety tip"" for spring break: don't be a rapist",UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/03/new-details-on-claims-against-chadima-emerge,"March 19, 2012 | 12:46am CDT"," The university revealed the details of two sexual misconduct accusations against former Associate Athletic Director John Chadima in a second reportFriday, involving a former football player and a second student employee.Former Dane County Judge Patrick Fiedler investigated the allegations made after his independent, university-commissioned report on the first sexual misconduct allegation against Chadima was released January 23.The first report investigated allegations of Chadima’s attempted sexual assault of an Athletic Department student employee during the 2012 Rose Bowl weekend.“Upon review of the second report — and further review of the first report — it is clear to me that our decision to remove Mr. Chadima from his workplace and conduct independent investigations was the prudent course of action,” Chancellor David Ward said in a statement Friday.Though no additional accounts of sexual misconduct were found, all accusations made against Chadima involved encounters where the victims were alone with him, the report said.   A former student employee of the Athletic Department made the first of these allegations. He was first approached at an employee party held in Chadima’s hotel suite during the Badgers’ participation in an unspecified bowl game in the 2000s. According to the report, Chadima approached the student and groped his “inner buttocks.”Chadima continued to pursue the student in Madison, making both sexually inappropriate physical and verbal advances in and around Camp Randall Stadium, the report said.A former UW-Madison football player made the second allegation, claiming that Chadima made several sexually explicit comments to him when he visited Madison in 2010 for a football game.The player had been drinking throughout the day, according to the report, and had spent time with former players and Chadima in a room off of the team’s locker room where “alcohol and mixers were available.”Chadima offered to give the former player a ride when the group decided to head to the bars. Rather than ending up downtown, however, the ride took him to Chadima’s house. According to the player, Chadima was driving  “too fast” for him to escape the car. When Chadima complimented the player’s buttocks, the player went on “high alert,” according to the report.The player locked himself in Chadima’s bathroom once asked to stay the night, and escaped after discovering him passed out on a bed.Fiedler and his assistants interviewed 30 people in the second investigation, including Athletic Director Barry Alvarez, head football coach Bret Bielema and a number of other individuals associated with the three allegations and the athletic department.Many spoke highly of Chadima in the report, describing him as a friend and as committed to the university. None of the individuals questioned had ever heard anything about his alleged sexual misconduct or abuse of power.Chadima’s attorney Charles Giesen responded to the nature of the anonymous accusations in a statement following the report’s release Friday, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.“It is regrettable that the university has given the weight it did to these anonymous allegations…It is implausible to believe that a 20-something former college football player would cower and lock himself in a bathroom because of a claimed fear of a 5-foot, 9-inches tall, 170-pound 45-year-old man who was supposedly intoxicated,” Giesen said in an e-mail to the Journal-Sentinel.Chadima issued his first response to the entire ordeal Friday ahead of the report’s release, according to the Journal-Sentinel.“The words [of support from family and friends] have fueled my commitment to seek help through counseling, in particular for alcohol, stress management and especially faith-based guidance,” Chadima said in Friday’s statement to the Journal-Sentinel.The university will conduct an internal review of campus alcohol policies in light of the second report, Ward said in Friday’s statement.",New details on claims against Chadima emerge,UWM

It also includes hour-by-hour details of what transpired after former senior associate athletic director John Chadima allegedly made inappropriate contact with a student employee earlier this year.Additionally, investigators submitted the final report on two subsequent allegations of misconduct by Chadima to the chancellor Monday.In the file describing the initial incident, which allegedly occurred following a Dec. 30 Rose Bowl party in Pasadena, university officials and campus police first briefed Ward around 10:05 a.m., Jan. 6.At approximately 11 a.m., the chancellor called Alvarez, who had worked closely with Chadima for years, saying, “UW will assume responsibility in investigating the matter and … Athletics should not lead, run a parallel or interfere with the investigation.”The chancellor then told Alvarez to put Chadima on unpaid leave, and stipulated that the associate athletic director should not be on campus or have contact with the alleged victim. After being placed on leave, Chadima resigned that same day.According to the investigators’ file, Ward also warned Alvarez, “There should be no retaliation against those who have reported [the incident].”According to the student employee’s allegations, Chadima asked him to stay late in his hotel room after a party. When the two were alone, Chadima reportedly reached down the student’s pants, at which point the student abruptly left the room and reported the alleged assault to his supervisors.Since that time, two additional allegations of misconduct have been made against Chadima. Investigators submitted the final report on the most recent charges to Ward Monday.In accordance with Wisconsin public records law, the university notified Chadima Monday about the anticipated public release on the latest investigations.The former associate athletic director will have 10 days to file a court motion objecting to the release of the findings.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/03/david-reports-from-sxsws-film-fest,"March 12, 2012 | 10:34pm CDT","South by Southwest’s film portion runs from March 9-17 this year, and the Cardinal’s own film columnist David Cottrell is in Austin taking it all in.Day 1: Gloom and DoomRain, gloom and a chill in the air. Not exactly the welcome I expected from the Longhorn State. Texans certainly do movies differently. Five of the festival's film venues are located in the Alamo Drafthouse theaters.Each Alamo theater has rows of standard movie theater seats, but each row also features a bench-like table spanning the entire length. That's because Texans love to eat and drink, and during movies is no exception. Waitstaff run surreptitiously, hunched over to maintain sight lines, filling orders written out by patrons on white slips of paper, delivering the sustenance or inebriant right to the seat of its summoner.As Madisonians who have patronized summer movies on the terrace or any other WUD Film screening in the Unions know well, beer and movies were a match made in heaven. But Texans certainly know how to turn it up a notch—now you don't even have to leave your seat.Despite my perpetual dampness resulting from several long waits in outdoor lines in rainy Austin, all was forgotten during my first midnight screening of the festival: the self-dubbed ""post-feminist"" tale of revenge, ""Girls Against Boys.”The flick follows a beautiful, naive college girl working her way through school as a bartender in NYC. Repeatedly hurt, betrayed and abandoned by the men in her life, then sexually assaulted, she is pushed to the edge and then dragged over it by a mysterious stranger who offers to help her work out her frustrations. The two girls then embark on an odd, meditative-yet-surreal killing spree through New York, exacting revenge from the gender they feel has given them nothing but misery.Given the deliberate attractiveness of the deviants, the flick gives new meaning to the oft-used phrase ""torture porn,” though it packs much more thematic density behind it.Day 2: Documentaries and PersonalsToday I got to sit in a dark press screening room with four other writers and see an early screening of “We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists,” one of my most anticipated films of the festival, which premiered Sunday. It was an enthralling documentary presenting the story of Anonymous and the digital political protest movement redefining the paradigm of social and political movements in the early 21st century.I enjoyed the documentary thoroughly, but feel like there might be a bit of a learning curve for the unfamiliar that could have been smoothed out with a bit more explanation of certain matters.My first time in Austin’s ancient, beautiful movie palace from the early 20th century, the Paramount, was seeing the Aubrey Plaza/Mark Duplass time-travel comedy “Safety Not Guaranteed.” The film featured a witty script inspired by a real-life personal ad placed in a newspaper requesting “Somebody to go back in time with me... Bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed” which became a viral meme on the internet and an unexpectedly poignant performance by Mark Duplass.Duplass expertly weaves his character out of equal parts hilarity and sad reality, as the man who would place such an ad, believing he really can go back in time.The film becomes a light-hearted meditation on regret and missed opportunities, but ends up as a crowd-pleasing chuckle-inducer. Aubrey Plaza plays her usual deadpan, sassy self and was absolutely mobbed outside the theater by fans and camera flashes after the screening. In the land of the techie, pop-culture geeks, she’s certainly found her fanbase.Plaza’s “Parks and Recreation” costar Nick Offerman also has a flick at the festival called “Somebody Up There Likes Me” that I hope to catch later in the fest.Day 3: MumblecoreI had to sit front row today for the world premier of the Duplass brothers’ (“The League,” “Cyrus”) new movie, “The Do-Deca-Pentathalon,” but the strain in my neck was worth it.Two brothers, estranged since their teenage years when they competed in a 25-part homemade Olympic Games that ended in controversy, reunite twenty years later at a weekend family gathering and secretly compete once again in “The Do-Deca-Pentathalon” to determine once and for all who is the superior brother.The story feels like it could have been a much larger studio picture with a multi-million dollar budget, but as always the Duplass brothers Mark and Jay make it work on a shoestring budget, shooting most of the film at their parents’ house with a crew of their friends.The characteristic improvisation the Duplass brothers are known for in their productions is on display here, eliciting some hilarious scenes from the cast with the naturalistic dialogue characteristic of the mumblecore style of filmmaking.During the Q&A after the film, the Duplass brothers explained that the “Do-Deca” was a real competition created by two brothers that grew up down the street from them in Louisiana, and that they are hoping to have the real-life brothers compete once again to be documented and featured as an extra on the DVD release in the future.—David Cottrell",David reports from SXSW's Film Fest,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/02/military-women-victims-of-rape,"February 20, 2012 | 10:10pm CST"," Last week, the Pentagon opened 14,000 military jobs to women in uniform. The new roles include positions that are closer to the front lines, but one-fifth of military jobs, such as combat tank units and commando units, remain male-only. There is no international consensus on female roles in the military. Certain countries remain very strict in policy, but even countries with liberal policies may fail to enact them. Here in the U.S., the issue has drawn attention when the resurgent Rick Santorum issued statements regarding the matter.Santorum thinks women's new role will create ""a very compromising situation, where people naturally may do things that may not be in the interest of the mission because of other types of emotions that are involved."" He later elaborated on this statement, suggesting that men's natural protective instincts around women would disrupt combat missions.Santorum's comment is offensive to the highly trained members of the United States military. Portraying men as Neanderthals who can't act judiciously around females is not only offensive to men everywhere, but also wholly ignores the 865 women injured and more than 140 women killed in active duty since 2001.The suggestion that society should work to prevent men's ""protective instinct"" is horribly ignorant of the real situation. The Department of Defense estimates that in 2010, 19,000 service members were the victims of rape in the military. More than 20 percent of female veterans report being raped, with estimates of sexual assault as high as 41 percent. Women in the military are the victims of institutionalized sexual violence on a massive scale. For Santorum to suggest that men's protective instincts are of concern is grossly out of touch. Santorum has also stated that, if elected, he would re-enact Don't Ask Don't Tell. He believes that social values (he referenced the repeal of DADT as a ""social experiment"") should not interfere with military organization. Santorum must not realize the hypocrisy in this statement as he tries to force his own crooked social vision of women and gays onto the military.The senator's comments are actually more tolerable than Fox News contributor Liz Trotta's, who opts for tasteless victim blaming. Responding to the 64 percent increase in violent sexual assaults in the military since 2006, Trotta asks, ""What did they expect?"" She also blames ""the feminists"" who are trying to be ""warriors and victims at the same time."" Trotta must not be familiar with the 19,000 service members who already are both warriors and victims. She should ask them directly what they expected.How can the conservative half of American politics be expressing both uneducated victim-dismissal along with ugly and antiquated victim-blaming? I think that the discourse around sexual violence has come to a standstill. In this stasis, conservatives are regressing into indefensible views of gender relations. Since victim blaming has been thoroughly filleted, although it refuses to die, academics and social workers have struggled in their efforts to advance the fight against sexual violence. Materials such as ""stop date rape"" flyers that are addressed to potential rapists never really functioned beyond being a rhetorical device addressing the idiocy behind victim blaming. A new public campaign is hoping to inject some new ideas into this issue.Last month, the Men Can Stop Rape organization launched an exciting campaign aimed at college-aged men. The ""Where Do You Stand?"" campaign targets male bystanders to sexual violence. Text-heavy posters encourage men to fight sexual harassment by confronting the would-be assailants and harrassers that they know. One of the posters reads, ""When Jason wouldn't leave Mary alone, I said she's not into you any more, let it go."" MCSR also offers bystander intervention training. A nation-wide and well-funded campaign of this type could change how Americans confront sexual violence. This community approach is laudable, sustainable, and shows a new way to combat a crime as old as civilization. Without bringing community attention to the milieu of hypocrisies and double standards involved in gender relations, sexual violence will continue to be a problem in the American military, and in American society.David is a senior majoring in English.

Three of Alex’s Facebook friends saw the post and immediately followed Alex there.Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment, a student organization dedicated to ending domestic violence, stalking and sexual assault, created Paverson’s page, resembling a typical UW student’s account, to raise awareness about the relationship between stalking and technology on campus.According to PAVE, the campaign was created to educate students on how easy it is to be located through online posts. They are not advocating for students to stop publishing information on social media sites but rather to show how stalking has changed with technological advancement.In an age dominated by Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare, one in four victims reports being followed through some form of technology, according to the National Stalking Resource Center.For one week UW-Madison students followed the Facebook page and were invited to find “Alex Paverson” checking in at places like Ian’s Pizza, the Student Activity Center and Redamte Coffeehouse.For college students, running into friends on a campus happens daily. Since they have set schedules and live in relatively isolated environments, it can be hard to recognize stalking when it happens.Carmen Hotvedt, a violence prevention specialist from University Health Services, said stalking is any repeated behavior that can cause a reasonable person to feel fear, and can range from unwanted phone calls to following someone. “Is sending flowers stalking? No, not all the time. But it is when it sends a clear message over time,” Hotvedt said.Life Sciences Communications Professor Dietram Scheufele broadly described stalking as following people in inappropriate ways.  It’s “not your traditional ‘hanging outside someone’s home’ or ‘following them around in a weird creepy way,’” Scheufele said.Scheufele said certain behavior can be considered stalking even if it might seem socially acceptable.“In the case of stalking, social norms are irrelevant,” Scheufele said. “If 20 people say you’re not being stalked, but you think you are, you are right.”Scheufele said students should consider if they benefit by adding a person they just met to their social media pages.“Do you really need the 1,001 friend?” he asked.Hotvedt said stalking would still occur without technology, because the behaviors existed before.“[It] is really just another effective tool for stalkers to better access where the victim is,” Hotvedt said.Sharing a location will become a daily part of life and the methods will be perfected as technology further advances, Scheufele said. “There are going to be many more applications, and they’re going to make our lives easier,” Scheufele said. “But that also means if this is going to be a big chunk of our lives, we better learn how to use it responsibly.”Scheufele said it is important to be aware of what is actively shared online and what information is unintentionally revealed through global positioning systems on social media sites.“Picture the friend you like the most, and the friend you like the least,” Scheufele said. “Somewhere, everyone in that group will see everything you post.”The usage of the term “Facebook stalking” and other jokes that make light of the issue have made it harder to consider stalking a serious crime, Hotvedt said.   “We make so much fun of stalking in our culture that when it really happens we don’t see it,” Hotvedt said. “Victims don’t think they need help, or deserve help, or even think that it is stalking.”Hotvedt said blame is often placed on the victim for sharing the information in the first place, but stalking is never the victim’s fault.Scheufele said it’s never the problem of the victim, but rather the person who stalks is at fault. “This is a free country and a free society,” Scheufele said. “Anybody can do whatever they damn well please but that doesn’t give anybody the right to commit a crime or to make their lives miserable.” Half of stalkers faced with an intervention stop their behavior, according to Hotvedt.“Asking for help and acknowledging that it’s happening is usually a good first step,” Hotvedt said.Hotvedt recommended stalking victims seeking help to go to the Dean of Students, UW police, UHS or a friend.“Any kind of getting help is okay,” Hotvedt said.  “You don’t have to report if that doesn’t feel right for you, but many places on campus are well trained and well equipped to help.”",Social media blur the boundaries of personal privacy,UWM

According to the Wisconsin State Journal there were, ""two stabbings, three sexual assaults, three substantial batteries, four strong-armed robberies and numerous reports of property damage during and after the event.""Because of these events, this editorial board has no right to completely scoff at Mayor Paul Soglin and the Madison Police Department's attempts to end the party just because we want to drink all day, play dizzy bat, do a few beer bongs, order and eat an entire Domino's pizza, pass out and wake up in that detox center off the Beltline.But how do you shut down an event that students unofficially organize every year?You don't.You locate the problem areas, address the issues and modify the party in order to best circumvent the horrors that ensued last year. Fortunately, this is exactly what the Associated Students of Madison's Legislative Affairs Committee is trying to do.Over the course of the year, Legislative Affairs has been meeting with Soglin to discuss ways to ensure the party's survival, because there absolutely cannot be a repeat of last year. The party is a novelty and tradition for this campus, but we cannot deny the fact that it needs some tweaks. So here are our suggestions:First, the party can't be sponsored or commercialized. By allowing Capitol Neighborhoods Inc. and The Majestic to sell beer, the city is just asking for more out-of-towners to mar the streets. Vending beer and allowing open containers creates an ""everything goes"" attitude that non-Madison attendees already embody in the first place. After all, out of the 162 people arrested last year, 125 of them weren't UW-Madison students. Beer gardens only encourage drinking, especially for out-of-towners who may not know anyone living on Mifflin Street.Second, in order to curb the number of individuals flooding in from different cities, we see reason to patrol the dorms the same way they are patrolled on Halloween. If we prohibit students from having guests over Mifflin weekend, we might see a drop in the number of visitors attending the event. This could help lower the violence and damage usually caused by attendees with no respect for the city.Third, we strongly support Soglin's idea to promote safety through social media. Student's living on Mifflin should talk to one another and look out for each other during the event. It might not be such a bad idea to turn into those students who gate off their yards with orange, plastic fencing or limit drinking to the house or backyard. In order to limit violent activity and out-of-control behavior we should encourage Mifflin residents to communicate with each other before the event about who to allow in their homes to nurture a safer drinking environment.Students and guests need to remember they are being watched this year. It's important we show the city that the party can continue without violence or extreme damage to the town. While Mifflin is a treasured tradition, it is a costly one. Showing Soglin that it is worth the investment will ensure the party's survival for our children and our children's children. While we'd like to say to the city, ""sorry for partying,"" in this case, that just won't cut it.",Solutions for mifflin Street Block Party,UWM

Williams, 18 of Milwaukee; and Bruce H. Beckley, 18 of Milwaukee for alleged second-degree sexual assault for an incident in Witte Hall, 615 W. Johnson St., last September, according to Sgt. Aaron Chapin.Wisconsin State law defines second degree sexual assault as sexual contact or intercourse with threat of force or without consent. Penalties for the crime include fines, prison time or both.Allen, Williams and Beckley are UW-Madison freshmen living in Witte Hall, according to a friend of all three suspects.Chapin said the suspects knew the female victim, who does not attend UW-Madison. According to Chapin, the suspects are in Dane County Jail and follow-up continues in an open investigation.Allen and Williams, as part of the Pre-College Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence, were receiving a full-tuition scholarship.PEOPLE is a pre-college program designed for students of color and low-income students who are typically the first in their family to attend college. Once admitted to UW-Madison, students receive a full academic scholarship as long as recipients maintain a 2.0 GPA and take at least 12.0 credit hours.A UW-Madison Sellery Hall resident and PEOPLE program recipient who met Allen and William during the summer at a PEOPLE program said he was speechless at the news.“Me and Prentice have been friends for a long time...he’s a good kid,” he said. “I honestly did not expect this, and I kind of have a hard time believing this.”UW-Madison freshman and Witte resident Joe Illg said his dorm floor had a meeting around the time of the incident where his house fellow stressed taking safety precautions such as not letting people into Witte without an ID card and locking doors.Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment media advocate and Daily Cardinal staff member Jacqueline O’Reilly expressed her condolences for the victim and said assault happens frequently on college campuses.“It’s important to remember when something like this happens...that this isn’t a crime that happens every time you see a headline,” O’Reilly said. “It’s a crime that’s constantly happening, and it’s constantly happening to UW students.”",Three UW-Madison students arrested in alleged sexual assault,UWM

Fielder also headed an investigation concerning December’s allegations.After Ward briefly discussed the situation at a faculty senate meeting Monday, senate member Sarah Goldrick-Rab thanked the chancellor for updating faculty first hand.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/02/letter-tech-leads-to-victim-blaming,"February 6, 2012 | 8:06pm CST","A problem is much harder, if not impossible, to solve if the core of the issue is misunderstood. This holds true in all areas of life, but specifically the issue at hand this Stalking Awareness Month.Because of how it is portrayed in the media, people often write stalking off as a crime perpetrated by a creepy stranger, one that peers into women's windows in the middle of the night. While this form of stalking does happen and should be addressed, it is by no means the norm, especially on a college campus, making it difficult for people to truly understand the issue and how to help a victim when one comes forth.According to the Stalking Resource Center, 3.4 million people over the age of 18 are stalked in the United States each year, with people age 18-24 experiencing stalking at the highest rates. While there is little data specific to Madison, it can be inferred that not only is stalking happening on this campus, but that it is a big problem that demands our attention.What makes this phenomenon more likely is perpetrators' recent utilization of technology. One in 10 victims report being stalked through the use of some kind of technology, including text messaging and the Internet. Additionally, 10 percent of victims report being monitored with global positioning systems like those used on social media sites to post location updates.Knowing that most, if not all, students use at least one of these tools, it seems terribly likely that this is the form stalking often takes on the UW-Madison campus. However, because the specifics of this trend are confused, people often advise how they think students can best protect themselves.Just like women are told to never walk alone at night, not to drink too much or dress modestly as a means to prevent sexual assault, people are told to never post their location online, refrain from using applications like Foursquare and keep all online information private to protect themselves from stalking. If these are techniques that make a person feel reassured, then they should be taken. People should take whatever steps they need to in order to feel safe. Still, what comes from pushing these methods as a solution to stalking is often victim blaming.Instead of asking, ""How are you doing?"" or ""How can I help you?"" after a person has been victimized, we ask, ""Well was your profile set to private?"" or ""Why did you say where you were going anyway?"" This way of thinking shifts the blame away from the perpetrator and onto the victim. Additionally, like the techniques pushed to prevent sexual assault, the ways people are told to protect themselves against stalkers assume the perpetrator is a stranger, when in fact 75 percent of victims are stalked by someone they know, with 30 percent being stalked by a current or former intimate partner.To demonstrate the dynamics of stalking and technology, including how people are so easily moved to victim blaming, PAVE will host a Facebook scavenger hunt this week. In partnership with local businesses and organizations, PAVE has created a profile under the name Alex Paverson. During the week of February 6, it will function much like the average student's Facebook page does, including updates about where on campus ""Alex"" is. When friends of the account see these updates, they are invited to come to the location mentioned, with the first few winning a prize.The purpose of the project is not to stir up fear within the student body or to have them track the account, but rather to help the campus community understand how easily one could take advantage of Facebook's inherently social features if he or she had bad intentions.If we are going to truly eradicate stalking from the UW-Madison campus and beyond, these dynamics must be understood and victim-blaming attitudes put to bed. It is not difficult information to understand, but people must be willing to educate themselves to make that difference.PAVE is a student organization dedicated to ending sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking on the UW-Madison campus through education and activism.

""I don't think there's a quick fix.""Ward said he plans to begin discussions about the university's alcohol policies with the Faculty Senate's executive committee, the academic staff and student leaders.In discussing how to implement university alcohol policy changes, board member Adam Gamoran said using gift money to fund underage drinking, as in the Rose Bowl incident, should not happen.""Clearly there's no ambiguity at the present time about the advisability of using gift funds associated with the university to provide alcohol to underage people,"" Gamoran said.One of the student representatives on the board, Nicholas Schmuhl, said it is important students are involved in the review process.""Not only was this particular issue an issue of student welfare, but I think that students have a perspective that they can provide that would be really valuable,"" Schmuhl said.

Quickly forgetting the fact that senior athletic officials, including Athletic Director Barry Alvarez, knew of other parties, the athletic department and university handled the situation well. An investigation was completed and released in a timely fashion, and offices are considering multiple alcohol policy changes.These changes need to come from top officials. Chancellor David Ward put together an investigation, and this will hopefully bring about justice for the student victim. But if officials like Ward and Alvarez do not actually create and enforce new policies, it will be doing the UW-Madison community a disservice. Officials have given every indication that their intent is to reform, but we must wait until these changes go into effect to judge any further.However, the university's competent crisis management should not be the take-home message from this incident. No one should simply write off what happened as an issue specific to athletic departments-though it is hard to not notice the high-profile sexual assault scandals that have happened at other athletic departments at Penn State, Syracuse and The Citadel. We all need to understand that sexual assault is a problem that exists everywhere, not just in athletic departments.Our university has a reputation as a party school. Drinking does not only happen over Rose Bowl weekend and neither do assaults. As Ward explained, overzealous, poorly monitored partying is ""not an athletics issue, it's a social issue."" The UW-Madison community should not sit around and congratulate officials for handling the athletic department well , especially when issues still exist on campus.Sexual assault is not an uncommon crime on university campuses. One in four women are sexually assaulted in their lives. Of those, 95 percent of the victims knew their attacker. According to the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault, 15 percent of victims in 2011 were male. This is a crime that can affect anyone.Furthermore, 90 percent of victims will not report their assault. That is why it is important to note how courageous the student employee was to tell a different authority figure of Chadima's alleged unwanted advances. If we want to congratulate anyone for handling the situation well, it should be that student.Chadima's alleged assault is one of the largest scandals in recent UW-Madison history. But university officials, students and the rest of the community should look at the incident not as a passing incident, but as an opportunity to address similar problems on campus.Our campus has various groups that could help student sexual assault victims. Groups that aim to eradicate a culture that perpetuates sexual assault are Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment (PAVE) and End Violence on Campus (EVOC).

In the wake of allegations against Chadima, UW officials are investigating the “lack of clarification” for off-campus alcohol policies and procedures, Vice Chancellor for University Relations Vince Sweeney said Wednesday.The policy examination push comes at the recommendation of investigators who reported on the allegations and called on the university to consider developing rules or guidelines regarding alcohol service to students.“University staff with whom we talked were unaware of any university regulations that would provide guidelines for such events at off-campus facilities,” investigators noted.The report, released Tuesday by an independent investigative team, said a long night of drinking at an annual party in Chadima’s hotel suite preceded the alleged incident of sexual assault.The athletic department used donor funds to purchase the drinks that Chadima, a UW official, then offered freely to student employees, many under 21.“Chadima’s parties, in effect, were university events,” the report stated.Using donor funds, rather than taxpayer dollars, is common practice when buying alcohol for university events, according to Sweeney.But due to what Sweeney termed the “lack of clarification of policies and procedures for alcohol off-campus,” it is unclear whether the parties violated university policy in other ways.Regardless of official policy, Sweeney said, the university “ought not be hosting a party that involves or encourages underage drinking.”Vice Chancellor for Administration Darrell Bazzell will lead the alcohol policy examination, Sweeney said, emphasizing that Bazzell will be looking at policy campus-wide, not only within the athletic department.The university is not “pointing the finger at athletics and saying, ‘You have to review your policies,’” Sweeney explained. “These are campus policies.”Currently, there is no deadline to complete the alcohol review process.Sweeney said the timeline depends on what officials “unearth” in the course of their examination.",UW to review alcohol policies after sexual assault,UWM

University legal services will lead the investigation, according to Vice Chancellor for University Relations Vince Sweeney.The alleged incident occurred Dec. 31, when student “John Doe” reported to his supervisors that Chadima unfastened Doe’s pants and grabbed his genitals after a Rose Bowl party in Chadima’s hotel suite.Doe told his supervisors he did not want them to take action until their return to Madison for fear of disrupting the football team’s Rose Bowl preparations.Given this request, investigators felt the response process by the supervisors was “nearly a model” of how they would hope all such cases could be handled.  But investigators also noted the supervisors were uncertain how to immediately respond after Doe made the allegations.The investigative team reviewed reminders concerning proper sexual assault reporting procedure that university offices sent to faculty and staff last fall. While the large volume of information impressed investigators, they found it confusing at times, and suggest the university create a simplified reporting procedure for cases of sexual assault.Investigators also suggest the university clarify terms of confidentiality concerning parties involved with a sexual assault case.  During their testimonies to various officials, the supervisors reportedly became confused whether their names would be released publicly.Jacqueline O’Reilly, a representative from Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment and editor at The Daily Cardinal, said the group was pleased to see the complex situation handled well.“The way different [victims] handle their assault varies from case to case and ultimately what matters is that the people around them respect how they want to proceed,” O’Reilly said.  “In the case of the student, that appears to be the case and that is very comforting to PAVE.”",UW to review policies after sexual assault,UWM

Then, molestation accusations against Bernie Fine, an assistant basketball coach at Syracuse. And now, new details about what led John Chadima, an associate athletic director at Wisconsin, to resign earlier this month.”Twenty-four days after a drunk John Chadima allegedly forced his hands down a student employees pants and threatened to fire the student if he reported it, 18 days after Chadima was placed on administrative leave and resigned from his position, and a few hours after the university released its report on the incident, there it was. Wisconsin had become the next stop on the shameful tour of sexual assault scandals in college athletics, the latest program to be bunched in with Penn State and Syracuse on the nation’s roll of imfamy.But amid all of the shock and anger at someone like Chadima, who abused his power as a senior athletic department official to threaten his victims, Wisconsin students, fans and college sports observers in general should be relieved to see how the program has handled the allegations against Chadima.There was no years-long cover-up, nor has anyone tried to discredit the allegations against Chadima, regrettable decisions we saw at Penn State and Syracuse. Instead, when that student reported the alleged assault, it was dealt with in a timely and professional manner that emphasized getting to the bottom of what happened.Of course, the athletic department will have to answer for why it allowed Chadima to host parties and drink with students, some of whom were under 21, for years. But while this doesn’t excuse it, giving booze to underage college students—when not connected to sexual assault, as it should be obvious—is not likely to raise too many eyebrows.I don’t praise the Wisconsin Athletic Department out of blind student loyalty, either. There have been times when the program has wrongly sought privacy over transparency in handling scandals, and perhaps when faced with wrongdoing by an even more prominent figure the university could fail itself and its fans. And, of course, there could be another shoe waiting to drop if this report leads more students to come forward and say they were assaulted by Chadima or anyone else.But from where we stand today, the athletic department and univeristy handled the allegations in an honorable and refresing way. Wisconsin acted the way we would hope our institutions would act.Not long after the Penn State scandal began to subside last fall, I wrote about how something similar could happen at Wisconsin, or anywhere. The programs in State College and Madison aren’t all that different as institutions—they have brands to protect and public reaction to worry about, meaning they have the same incentives to cover up scandals rather than be transparent and forthright about them.Those incentives are still there, as is the reality that (no matter how much people like to pretend otherwise) this school and program we love is more than capable of being flawed and corrupt. That didn’t disappear overnight because Wisconsin did the right thing this time.But this week, as we recoil at what John Chadima allegedly did in a hotel room a few weeks ago and praise his victim for finding the courage to report the crime, we should recognize the university for its actions. We should thank the people in whom we invest our trust for showing they are worthy of it.How could Wisconsin better handle the John Chadima scandal?

The party included between 25 and 30 people, about half of whom were students and several Athletic Department staff members.After nearly seven hours during which guests consumed alcohol provided by the Athletic Department, an allegedly intoxicated Chadima requested the remaining student, named John Doe in the report, also intoxicated, stay to have another drink.Seated at a corner table, Chadima reportedly told Doe he and other student employees ""thought [Doe] might be gay."" Doe told investigators he watched in shock as Chadima then removed Doe's belt and put his hand down Doe's pants, touching his genitals.After Doe slapped Chadima's hand away, Chadima allegedly retorted, ""I thought you liked it,"" asked, ""What are you going to do about it?"" and told Doe, ""I could have you fired.""Soon after, Doe told supervisors about the incident, but said he did not want them to take immediate action out of fear of disrupting the football team's Rose Bowl preparations.After returning to Madison, Doe's supervisors reported the incident to UW-Madison Police, which encouraged him to contact the Dean of Student's Office. The supervisors chose to contact Athletic Department officials instead.The supervisors then met with several Athletic Department officials before the department turned its investigation over to the chancellor's office following the University Legal Counsel's advice.The same day, Chancellor Ward and Athletic Director Barry Alvarez placed Chadima on administrative leave as they continued investigations.The report concluded that Chadima's parties were ""in effect, university events,"" because the Athletic Department purchased the alcohol served in a university official's hotel suite.In response to the allegations in the report, Chadima released a statement Tuesday expressing regret and apologizing to his co-workers, friends and family.""I make no excuses and have come to the realization that over the past few months, alcohol had controlled and consumed my life,"" Chadima said in the statement. ""I take full responsibility for my lack of judgment and actions that evening.""In addition to the allegations involving Doe, investigators discovered a series of text messages between Chadima and a different student employee, in which Chadima demanded the student come to his hotel suite and threatened to fire him if he did not comply. According to the statement, the student was unwilling to talk with investigators.Investigators said many interviewed for the report were ""shocked"" by the allegations as they, including Doe, described Chadima as friendly, supportive and highly respected.",Report: John Chadima sexually assaulted student on Rose Bowl trip,UWM

It is the only “adult sex crime” Wisconsin does not pursue as a felony.The DA’s office dismissed the sexual assault and false imprisonment charges Monday. However, Aghdam pled guilty to disorderly conduct, a noncriminal offense, Monday.The Wisconsin State Journal reported Thursday that Aghdam, who had been on paid leave since the charges were filed, was cleared to return to his post at the university Oct. 11 but only after an investigation deemed him a nonthreat to others.Aghdam maintained his innocence throughout the case and said the woman fabricated the story, according to the State Journal.",District Attorney drops sexual assault charges filed against UW-Madison employee,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/12/students-push-forward-plan-addressing-conceptions-of-sexual-assault,"December 9, 2013 | 4:59pm CST","A sexual assault survey students will receive in their inboxes over winter break will launch the next step in a campaign aiming to improve how the campus perceives and prevents sexual violence.A focus group through the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Campaign created the survey. The group is composed of representatives from Associated Student of Madison University Affairs Committee, Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment and the School of Public Health.The survey will ask questions ranging from how students identify concepts such as rape culture to assess their familiarity with policies surrounding sexual assault, said outgoing University Affairs Committee Chair Kayla Van Cleave. The final goal, she said, is to “identify the perception of what students have experienced on campus as well as the perception of what services are available.”Van Cleave said the campaign’s response to the data will likely be education to target knowledge deficits, which might include artwork to tackle emotions surrounding sexual assault. In addition, the campaign may push for prevention measures such as self-defense classes.Four University of Wisconsin-Madison students spearheaded SAPR in response to what they perceived as injustices in treatment of students both in the Wisconsin system and nationwide.“When we started to realize there was something wrong, we said to ourselves, we could do something,” group member Catie Rutledge said.The students took the idea to ASM, where representatives voted to pursue the campaign.UW-Madison’s campaign overlaps with the work of the UW System student organization United Council, which targets Wisconsin Chapter 17, a policy that dictates disciplinary procedures for non-academic issues including sexual assault. Some have criticized it for creating an overly complicated process of convicting students of sexual assault.Although the campaign originally considered addressing the policy, Van Cleave said there is a chance Chapter 17 may change in the near future. At the moment, she said, SAPR plans to focus on creating less intensive changes, which may include looking at other university policies.As a whole, Van Cleave said SAPR is not created in response to a specific issue, but an uncertainty about how students perceive sexual assault.“It’s more just a general unknown, general silence around sexual assaults that needs to be delved into,” Van Cleave said.",Students push forward plan addressing conceptions of sexual assault,UWM

The resulting government shutdown, waged over party lines that blurred as the 16-day affair played out, soured politicians and the general public to Congress’ ability to make legislative progress.The Democratic Senate and the Republican House of Representatives,were caught in astalemate after the far right members of the House refused to pass a budget without a significant unraveling of the Affordable Care Act. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., refused the House Republicans’ requests and both legislative houses spun their wheels up to and past the Oct. 1 deadline.The shutdown put approximately 800,000 federal employees out of work and cost the nation’s capitol approximately $200 million a day.After 16 days and a drop in Republican popularity, legislators voted to end the shutdown and push major fiscal decisions to Feb. 7. Armed robberies puts campus on high alertAlmost immediately after students returned to campus this semester, WiscAlerts of armed robberies in the area filled university inboxes. For several weeks, it seemed safety was on everyone’s mind and the libraries were desolate soon after the sun went down.That is, until Oct. 24, when police arrested 21-year-old Kendredge Dillard in Illinois for his alleged role in an armed robbery on the 500 block of West Mifflin Street.Police suspect Dillard played a role in an estimated 20-30 armed robberies prior and that he had accomplices. His arrest brought an end to the nearly two-month-long armed robbery spree.Ald. Mike Verveer, District 4, said on Oct. 24 “the news today is not only welcome, but I think a huge relief.”Dillard’s jury trial will begin Jan. 23.Still, Associated Students of Madison Secretary Carissa Szlosek said Nov. 4 “I hope that everyone is still engaged in this, regardless of whether the crime rate is up or down.”State Street to change drastically in near futureThis semester brought about multiple changes to the future of State Street. Madison’s Common Council approved a downtown development Aug. 6 and the Comedy Club on State owner bought The Orpheum Theatre Oct 25.The Hub project, a 329-unit mixed apartment and retail complex will replace the University Inn on the 500 block of State Street and displaced several restaurants. They include Husnu’s, Kabul, Buraka, Roast, Jimmy John’s and Campus Candy, which all vacated their buildings Oct. 31.Core Campus, the Chicago developers, began demolition in November and hope to complete the project by fall 2015. Ald. Mike Verveer, District 4, likened the housing complex to that of Lucky Apartments.New Orpheum owner Gus Paras said he intends to restore the theater’s historic marquee. He is also allowing Frank Productions, which managed the Orpheum under the authority of Monona State Bank after the bank foreclosed on the property in fall 2012, to produce booked shows through February.Biennial state budget creates two-year tuition freeze, controversial future provisionsThe 2013-’15 state biennial budget, which passed this summer despite heavy Democratic lambasting, saw both sides of the aisle join together to support a provision to freeze University of Wisconsin System tuition through the 2014-’15 school year.The tuition freeze developed from a much-debated discovery of approximately $648 million in unrestricted UW System funds. Legislators saw the large reserve as an affront to students, who had faced a 5.5 percent increase in tuition for the past six years. The initial freeze applied only to in-state students, but the UW System eventually extended it to all UW students.Walker signed the budget June 29, saying it would lower taxes to benefit citizens. However, his decisions to change state Medicaid coverage in the face of Affordable Care Act implementation and to expand the statewide voucher school system have been controversial with Democratic legislators.The state is scheduled to continue implementing the budget provisions as the year progresses.Affordable Care Act deadline extended on state, federal levels after problematic rolloutPresident Barack Obama pushed through an unprecedented health care reform bill that would allow children to stay on their parents’ health care longer, make premiums cheaper and stop insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions.Millions of optimistic Americans logged onto healthcare.gov Oct. 1, hopeful they could sign up for health care through the federal exchange.Not only was the website unusable, but citizens who had been promised by Obama they could keep their health care coverage if they so wished, were getting kicked from their insurance plans.In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker declined federal funds to expand the state’s medicaid program, BadgerCare.After the federal government extended deadlines for people to sign up for insurance, Walker called Wisconsin’s Legislature back for a special session to align the state’s deadline with the federal deadline.The Assembly approved a bill extending the deadline, but leaving a coverage gap for 83,000 childless adults.UW System President Kevin Reilly announces retirementUniversity of Wisconsin System President Kevin Reilly announced July 2013 he will step down from his position at the end of this year.Reilly became president of the 26 UW campuses in 2004. During his tenure, Reilly appointed over 31 chancellors, increased enrollment by 8.9 percent and established himself as the second-longest president of the system.At Reilly’s last Board of Regents meeting Friday, multiple regent members commended the outgoing president on his nine years of service, highlighting his continuous integrity.“I just feel very privileged to have played a role for nine years in helping to advance the university and the quality of life for all,” Reilly said.Board of Regents Chair Michael Falbo said the search for a new system president has been overseen by a search and screen committee comprised of both regents and notable UW figures.The committee will narrow down the applicant pool and will potentially make a recommendation to the board Jan. 10. Commencement moves to Camp RandallSince 1991, the University of Wisconsin-Madison has held spring commencement away from Camp Randall, but this May, the graduation ceremonies that attract nearly 6,000 graduates and 40,000 guests, will once again be consolidated into one ceremony at Camp Randall.Traditionally, there are four ceremonies over the course of the three-day weekend. The switch was made by Chancellor Rebecca Blank and representatives for the class of 2014.Part of the reasoning behind the change was likely to attract a larger commencement speaker, because often times, speakers are unable to commit to all four ceremoniesFollowing the announcement in October, concerns about weather and length of the ceremony arose from different groups. However, campus leaders have insisted the ceremony is still expected to run approximately two hours and will be held rain or shine.Dean of Students Lori Berquam said students will have a chance to hear their names and receive diplomas at smaller ceremonies held by individual departments and colleges.Madison Police Chief retires after nine yearsMadison’s chief public safety official stepped down Sept. 27 after nearly nine years at the head of the Madison Police Department.Noble Wray, born in Milwaukee in 1960, said one of the biggest challenges he faced as the police chief was upholding first amendment rights while keeping the public safe during the 2011 protests.The most important thing Wray said he learned during his 28 years at the MPD was to “take a moment to recommit” to the unconditional pledge of public service.“It’s unconditional because you know that at some point in time you may be put in a situation life or death and you can’t run away from it, you’ve got to run to it,” Wray said. “And we tend to lose that along the way.”Assistant Police Chief Randy Gaber is serving in the interim chief until the Board of Police and Fire Commissioners appoints a new chief, hopefully in early 2014.Classified staff becomes part of shared governanceClassified staff officially became part of campus governance in September.  The Board of Regents approved the UW-Madison Classified Staff Executive Committee Sept. 6, following in the footsteps of other UW institutions. The advisory committee will be part of shared governance, a system of faculty, academic staff and student groups that give input on campus governance and policy development.Classified staff make up 30 percent of campus employees. Classified positions are those that have similar descriptions as other jobs in the Wisconsin government and include custodians, accountants and administrative assistants.Committee Vice Chair Gary Mitchell told The Daily Cardinal in November the formation of the committee was a response to Wisconsin Act 10, which reduced the staff’s collective bargaining rights.Classified staff elected the executive committee in October, and it met several times over the course of the semester. The committee’s work was largely focused on creating bylaws and solidifying the structure of the organization.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/11/hooksteads-rape-culture-letter-shows-some-still-hold-gross-world-views,"November 6, 2013 | 9:35pm CST","The Badger Herald’s recent letter-to-the-editor “'Rape culture' does not exist” further proves the University of Wisconsin- Madison’s preeminent ego-inflamed, aggressively misogynistic, notorious “semi celebrity” David Hookstead unsurprisingly doesn’t harbor the capacity to understand the concept “rape culture.” There has already been an onslaught of backlash in response to his column—appalled voices furiously speaking against what is clearly a gross rhetorical misrepresentation of the truth on a core level. All anger toward this abomination is totally warranted. But my response here is not intended to insult or belittle Hookstead as a person (social media can take care of that). All I’m going to do is explain why his claim is wrong.Had Hookstead done the absolute minimum in terms of researching rape culture (reading the first sentence of the “Rape culture,” according to Wikipedia page), he would have discovered his murky definition to be completely unfounded and incorrect. “Rape culture,” according to The Free Encyclopedia, ""is a concept which links rape and sexual violence to the culture of society, and in which prevalent attitudes and practices normalize, excuse, tolerate, and even condone rape.”So if this isn’t a real thing, as Hookstead so vehemently believes, why did he find it necessary to share this on his personal Twitter account on Aug. 3, 2013? “Worst/Funniest pick up line I’ve ever heard: ‘How do I know we’re having sex later tonight? I’m stronger than you.’”If making a joke out of something that has ruined countless lives isn’t the outright definition of rape culture, I’m not sure what is.So, maybe saying “rape culture doesn’t exist” wasn’t precisely Hookstead’s point, since he doesn’t understand its true meaning. I think what he was actually trying to say was that regurgitating and being insensitive toward archaic actions such as sexual assault doesn’t actually cause rape. This is why he makes the statement, “Anybody who’s ever watched the news knows that rape is illegal, and yet the above paints the picture that our society is failing to educate young men on rape. Secondly, it implies that education can prevent true acts of evil … Once again, you can’t always stop criminals.” To me, it seems pretty obvious that continually tolerating a certain behavior—in this case, one’s ability to trivialize rape and sexual assault—will only cause that habit to continue. So, whatever he was trying to say, it’s wrong.The terms privileged and ignorant have been thrown around before to describe Hookstead’s warped world views (which are unfortunately still being published in a college newspaper all too willing to generate website hits at the expense of the one in four college women who will be subjected to rape). I think this is why he finds it so difficult to identify as a part of rape culture, and also why he seems to think people don’t get worked up about topics such as drugs or murder in disenfranchised neighborhoods, which they most certainly do.He mentions how men are also victims of rape and sexual assault. But instead of realizing this fact entirely deflates his thesis, Hookstead for some reason latches on to this fact as another reason to demonize women. He goes so far as to ask “Why aren’t we teaching our daughters not to rape?” Hookstead is, simply, afraid of empowering the opposite sex, or even treating women with fairness, in any way. Every argument of his somehow has to come back to males being better than females. And I think that’s why he felt so compelled to write this monstrosity in the first place.Oh, and then there’s this quote: “A woman drugged a close friend of mine, who was a superstar athlete, so that she could assault him. There was little outrage, but you could imagine if a superstar athlete drugged a random woman and raped her? It’d be on the national news by morning.” Apparently someone hasn’t heard of Stuebenville, Ohio, where members of a football team were involved in a rape that didn’t receive national attention until a hacker leaked information found on social media about the case. The story was covered up by people in the town and the victim was intimidated by those around her. There is no basis to this claim.It’s disturbing someone would find it acceptable to submit or publish such a poorly thought-out article on such a sensitive subject. But I’m glad Hookstead wrote this column—I really am—because it serves a reminder to us all that there are people outside of our immediate circle of influence who believe truly horrendous and erroneous things. It should make you angry. Be angry we are allowing this person to speak for us as a student body. I know I am.Do you agree with Andy? What do you think of David Hookstead’s tweets?

Tonight not only gives students a better understanding of how to avoid these incidents, but how to receive help after an incident occurs, according to the UHS website.In previous years, Tonight was optional, but this year all incoming students were required to take the program. Students took a pre-test and a post-test to become eligible for spring class registration.“We are hoping to see change from the pre-test to the post-test in terms of gaining some knowledge and skills,” UHS Graduate Assistant Molly Zemke said. Zemke asked the University Affairs members to give their input on the Tonight program.Many members commented that Tonight was useful in helping new students realize sexual assault can happen on college campuses. Since Tonight was created by UW-Madison students depicting the UW-Madison campus, members said they found it showed a better representation of what to expect on campus. University Affairs members suggested to Zemke that the program needs scenarios geared towards incoming students, true stories from assault victims and the male perspective.The University of Wisconsin-Madison is paving the way for other universities with this program, according to Zemke. She also discussed that due to the Violence Against Women Act, other campuses are required to create prevention education programs and they are looking at Tonight for inspiration.Members were curious to see if Tonight would spread to other UW campuses in the future.

The complaint then goes to the Department of Public Instruction, which holds a hearing and reviews the complaint before deciding whether to allow the school to keep the race-based mascot.The focal point of recent debate has been the Mukwonago, Wis. district, which uses the name “Indians” for its teams. The new bill would only make a nickname-based complaint, such as one over the ""Indians"" nickname, valid if a population equaling 10 percent of the district’s student population supports it. The bill would also change the reviewing agency to the Department of Administration.Democrats have said the bill represents blatant discrimination against the state’s Native American population, because the bill makes the complaint process difficult and ignores all 11 state tribes who have each come out against race-based mascots.State Sen. Dale Schultz, R-Richland Center, who joined Democrats in voting against the bill, compared the bill to only allowing a woman to file a sexual assault complaint after receiving approval from 10 percent of the electorate.State Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, who is an African-American woman, used the word “nigger” five times while explaining her point about the harm race-based nicknames inflict on tribal populations.“I hope it makes you uncomfortable when you hear me say nigger,” Taylor said while addressing the Senate body. “But I wish you would be as uncomfortable when I say savages, redskins or even Indians.”State Sen. Mary Lazich, R-New Berlin, who sponsored the bill in the Senate, stood several times to emphasize the bill did not concern discrimination or racism but only concentrated on “process.” Lazich said the current system puts automatic guilt on school districts using race-based mascots and does not leave room for the district to defend itself.“This bill is about a process for a complaint to come to attention,” Lazich said. “This bill is not about offensive mascots or racism.""

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/11/rape-culture-in-the-u-s-does-indeed-exist,"November 5, 2013 | 10:58pm CST","It looks like The Badger Herald has embraced the thoughts of the one Mr. David Hookstead again. And this one is a doozey!Let it be known Badgers, rape culture DOES NOT EXIST! Well, according to Hookstead it doesn’t, at least. For God’s sake, it does though. This is like asking the obvious question, is the Pope Catholic? We should not be having this conversation any more, but it appears we need to have a talk with Hookstead again and explain to him why rape culture does indeed exist.According to PAVE, University of Wisconsin-Madison’s peer-to-peer sexual assault awareness and victim advocacy group, rape culture—the one in which we live—views sexual assault (an umbrella term including rape) as an inevitable thing that is unchangeable. To expand on that, a rape-support culture is one that includes various cultural phenomena that either sympathizes with sexual assailants (i.e. rapists, stalkers, people who perpetrate intimate partner violence etc.) while putting the blame for such acts on the victim.This culture, the one that apparently doesn’t exist, is reinforced by Hookstead! The most recent Letter to the Editor systematically alienates one in five women on campus and other victims of sexual violence.Sexual assault and intimate partner violence (aka domestic violence) are incredibly prevalent as the statistic above shows and are often connected with other forms of abuse. Although other crimes do exist, it is important to spotlight forms of sexual assault, because many crimes can become interrelated. The sheer prevalence of sexual assault is reason for it to remain in the spotlight. Murder might be a high profile crime, but it is much less common than sexual assault. One quarter of the women on campus are not murdered during their time at UW-Madison, but one quarter become victims of sexual assault.Cultures do shape crime as well. Murder is more common in the United States than it is in many other developed countries because we do live in a violent society. I don’t mean this in the sense that we watch violent movies and the British don’t. Nor do I mean that we have a violent past and Russia doesn’t, but we live in a society in which violence is seen as a way to exert power and control, and resolve issues we have. Studies have looked into this and all you need to do is watch “Bowling for Columbine” to get a hint of this. That violence can be used in other ways too… like, oh, sexual violence. While people are not inherently good or bad, they are shaped by their culture to do good or bad things. Various cultural tools can be used to retain certain power balances whether those balances are based on race, religion, sexual orientation or gender.Rape culture exists all over the place in the United States. Some of it is in the media like Tyler Farr’s country song “Redneck Crazy” and the accompanying music video but much of it is on the street. This can range from using sexist language or language that demeans a person based on their sex or gender to joking about rape like it is not big deal. Going into a classroom and saying ‘Wow, that exam raped me’ undermines the experience victims go through and it makes the action of the perpetrators seem as mundane as a difficult exam.Rape culture is the culture that views female sexuality as being irrelevant. It claims ownership of other people and their bodies. It is telling somebody that if they didn’t want to get raped they shouldn’t have worn that skirt because it was too short or those heels because they couldn’t run or they should’ve had mace because they shouldn’t have the freedom to feel safe walking home from the bars at night.Such things are never invitations to perpetrate sexual assault. Nothing is an invitation to commit sexual assault and should ever be used as an excuse to commit sexual assault. And lots of young men are taught that rape and sexual assault are acceptable means to gain power over women. Please, tell me that the letter recently sent to members of a fraternity in Georgia telling them how to take advantage of women at a party for sex was not instructions on this? Please, tell me there wasn’t any pressure on these young men to have sex? Are we to believe that rape wouldn’t be seen as an acceptable option at some point?And for the record, men are not to blame for all assaults happening. Yes, men are the victims of sexual assault like women, sometimes at the hands of women, sometimes at the hands of men, but the fact of the matter is men are the perpetrators of around 95 percent of all instances of sexual assault. That is not to say all men are doing this. Only about 5 percent of men commit such acts, but this is still something that is a crime disproportionately committed by men against women. This is according to statistics from Sex Out Loud and PAVE.The unfortunate thing is we don’t even know the real scope of sexual assault, because many times it goes unreported. Sexual assault is not regrettable sex however, but the use of sex and sexual violence as a means to coerce, manipulate, degrade and disempower people. Women are not using this as a way to demonize men. This is people—more than just women—pointing out there is an entire culture around us that supports widespread sexual violence against them and that this must change. We do live in a rape-support culture, and it is up to us to change that culture, but we can do it.Not with the help of one Badger though, but he can shove off. For those of you who believe in the existence of the rape-support culture and want to help by supporting victims of sexual assault, bringing rape culture to an end or simply want to learn more I highly recommend getting in touch with PAVE. They, in addition to the Rape Crisis Center at UHS, are wonderful student resources for victims of sexual assault looking for support resources and potential allies.What did you think of David Hookstead’s letter published in The Badger Herald?

There are several aspects of the recent Letter to the Editor that Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment (PAVE) feels warrant response.We noticed a misinterpretation of what “rape culture” actually is. Rape culture is the way society comes to understand rape as unavoidable. This leads people to believe that rape and sexual assault are unstoppable phenomena, and often even acceptable. Directly in contrast to this is the idea that rape happens because people are inherently evil. Rape culture is not a result of bad people, but is a societal construct that perpetuates harmful victim blaming attitudes.We would also like to pause to define rape and sexual assault. People do understand that rape is illegal, but often people do not have a full understanding of what rape and sexual assault actually are. Rape is vaginal, anal and/or oral penetration without consent. Sexual assault is any sexual contact without consent. Consent is a free and clearly given yes, not the absence of a no, and cannot be received when a person is incapacitated by alcohol or drugs.Part of rape culture is perpetuating harmful myths that surround sexual violence, many of which were exemplified in the previously published letter. One such myth is the idea that sexual assault is often falsely reported and that every time a woman reports to the police, the perpetrator goes to jail. Sexual assaults are falsely reported at the same rate as other crimes such as theft. By falsely accusing women of falsely accusing rapists, you are taking away the credibility of real victims. Beyond this, only three out of 100 rapists will ever spend even a single day in prison—this number being out of the 40 out of 100 that are reported to police at all (Department of Justice).The false report myth is related to the idea that many women use rape as an excuse for drunken sex that they regret. Sexual assault survivors carry an enormous amount of stigma provided to them by rape culture, and coming out as a victim or survivor can be a traumatizing experience in itself. Disclosing a sexual assault is not exploitation for publicity, and only the victim is able to define their experience. Another myth perpetuated by this article is that rap culture is rape culture. Rape culture is not the product of a single identity, culture, or musical genre.There is also the myth that sexual assault is caused by drinking, which leads to the at titude that a woman who drinks is responsible if she is assaulted.These myths are harmful in many different ways. They contribute to rape culture by creating a structure that blames victims rather than supports them. This then works to silence victims, through communicating that their experience was invalid, or that they are in some way at fault. The people affected are not just statistics, and rape culture is not a fallacy—this culture exists, and silences your friends, family, peers and your own understanding of experience and trauma.We understanding that recognizing rape culture can be difficult. It is never simple to recognize the role that each of us plays in problematic behavior. No one wants to recognize that the language they use or the media outlets they support contribute to a culture that minimizes the experience of sexual assault survivors. However, this is no excuse for denial. If more people take responsibility for their own role in perpetuating rape culture, it is possible to stop the cycle. People reaffirming harmful beliefs, whether directly or through silence, contribute to rape culture.Lastly, thank you to those who have been speaking out in a positive way. Your voices count!

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/11/ethics-are-more-important-than-notoriety,"November 5, 2013 | 1:24am CST","A fundamental principle of journalism is the productive incitement of discussion that does not arrive at the harmful expense of readers. In publishing the letter “‘Rape Culture’ Does Not Exist,” The Badger Herald has done one of these things correctly: opened a floodgate of dialogue for students to weigh in and victims to share experiences. However, the catalyst to this discussion has been an unproductive means of reaching a productive dialogue.The campus outcry (primarily via social media) has provided a plethora of opinions as well as fact-based evidence on the issue of rape culture. In publishing the letter, the Herald has exhibited an unflinching neglect for the experiences of the very people that have laid eyes on the piece. There is a level of privilege in aimlessly publishing such a piece without warning those whom it may offend, and it has served as a trigger for victims of rape and sexual assault throughout the campus as well as in the depths of the Internet.An ethical dilemma lies at the center of this outcry: the role of the media in becoming the catalyst for controversy. We operate in an industry where we are responsible for showcasing the glory of the world juxtaposed with how ugly it can become. This does not function as a dichotomy, but a spectrum for anything and everything we deem newsworthy. This is not an unpublishable topic, but upon accepting this responsibility as a gatekeeper of opinions, there is a level of preparation and caution and accountability; The Badger Herald staff who led this piece to publication has made a fundamental misjudgement.While editors have a commitment to take care in publishing opinion columns, letters are from the public, not a newspaper’s staff members. This means letters cannot be edited for content. Still, editors have no commitment to publish these letters.However, editors can frame the context of these letters. This letter was printed in the paper without any warning or disclaimer above the article. With sensitive topics such as sexual assault, it is imperative that editors provide a context to readers that minimizes potential damage.In an attempt to do this, the Herald added a note indicating that the letter could invoke memories and emotions surrounding sexual assault later on in the day it was published. However, newspapers need to be proactive instead of reactive when publishing opinions on sensitive topics—this means having the foresight to anticipate negative reactions and address them before the harm is done. This Board feels that if this letter would have been published and presented differently, we would be having a different conversation.This Editorial Board understands the opinions expressed in the letter are not those of the Herald staff as a whole. Still, more care needs to be taken when addressing letters and columns that evoke strong emotional responses from specific groups of people. It is careless to place a letter of such controversial content in a public forum, with no regard to its context, its framing or its potentially traumatic consequences. For a newspaper to run a letter containing such polarizing, alienating ideas simply because its author is semi-(in)famous and would earn them “shares” or paid clicks on their website is nothing short of irresponsible.Furthermore, editors have the responsibility to minimize harm for the public. Although the Herald added a disclaimer to the article on its website as it began gaining attention, people who may have avoided the letter in the first place undoubtedly were exposed to its inflammatory and harmful content. As readers have commented, for survivors of sexual assault, the piece brought back trauma—trauma that is already pushed aside, hidden and shamed by the very culture the writer denies.These people do not merely exist in characters and typeface; real people, citizens of our campus community and beyond, have poured their stories in comments and responses. This productivity has created a double-edged sword of harming the very people who have experienced rape and sexual assault without the proper sensitivity or tact. Furthermore, the editor’s note added to the digital edition has done nothing but serve as a faulty attempt to bandage the wound. This was a grave miscalculation that should serve as a teaching moment: No one deserves to open the morning paper or load their social network and feel exposed at the hands of the very institution that is entrusted with the responsibility and accountability to discover truth through productive dialogue.Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Ethics are more important than notoriety,UWM

These students often have to learn how to acclimate to issues that affect the neighborhood such as sexual assaults, battery and homelessness, according to Kelly.Kelly also stressed that based on towns of comparable sizes, Madison is the fourth safest city in the nation. He said the community is hearing about crime more often because it is being spread through social media.“There is no real giant spike in crime lately, it’s just been more publicized,” Kelly said. “In a sense, it’s a good thing because people know what’s going on, but at the same time it’s kind of given the perception that things have gone downhill.”Still, he said taking precautions, such as having situational awareness and using the buddy system are ways to maintain safety at night.He said his main goal is to serve as the contact for tenants at the apartments and Greek houses on Langdon Street when a problem arises. He said he is looking to open up lines of communication with the community to help keep residents safe.In order to connect with students, Kelly said he is open to using technology, such as the department’s Facebook page, which in the past has not been updated regularly.“Community policing is something that has dramatically changed policing,” Kelly said. “I want to be out there in the community, making myself known, making contacts.”",UW Alumnus Shawn Kelly prepares to take over as new Langdon neighborhood officer,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/10/david-hookstead-needs-to-shut-up,"October 24, 2013 | 10:55pm CDT","In a recent Letter to the Editor published in the Badger Herald, University of Wisconsin-Madison junior David Hookstead outlined his feelings on the increased crime around campus. He proposes three steps to take to help lower crime: prioritize police attention, allow students with conceal-carry permits to carry guns on campus and for people to travel in groups specifically for women to travel in groups with a man. The latter two steps he offers are ridiculous proposals. Although I agree with him regarding the prioritization of police attention, his thinking on access to guns will likely create more problems than they solve and his assertion that travel in groups with men is what will protect us ignores the reality of circumstances around lots of crimes being alluded to.The problem with proposing students be allowed on campus with their weapons is that the university would be allowing guns into campus spaces when there is no conclusive evidence that conceal and carry policies actually are effective methods for lowering crime. The research that the National Rifle Association often cites as evidence that conceal carry laws lower crime have on multiple occasions been debunked by additional readings of the material. It has been shown clearly that conceal-carry rights neither decrease nor increase crime. This is reason enough to realize guns shouldn’t be allowed on campus. My feeling is that if society can’t trust people between the ages of 18 to 21 to drink than we can’t be trusted to wield guns. Hookstead goes on by advising student to travel in groups. Although there is an amount of validity in his proposal, it does nothing to solve crime at its roots; it’s just a risk reduction strategy. What this means is responsibility is put on the potential victims to not become victims, rather than looking for ways to prevent perpetrators from attempting to carry out crimes. I use this terminology specifically, because Mr. Hookstead uses highly sexist language in his letter. In addition to advising students to travel in groups, he suggests that female students need to travel in groups with at least one man to lower their risk of becoming victims of crime. At this point he blatantly reiterates the age-old stereotype of women needing men to get through life; it is the damsel in distress who needs the gallant prince to help her, or a stereotype that is far from reality and reinforces gender stereotypes. I can’t help but think Hookstead had sexual assault in mind when he referred to women being more vulnerable than men, but even the recent spike in crimes appear to be affecting men and women students equally.Not only does he offer no more than risk reduction, but he fails to see that potential victims of sexual assault are unlikely to be assaulted by somebody they don’t know on the street. This is because most sexual assaults occur at the home of either the victim or perpetrator, and the vast majority of victims know their assailant personally or they are at least acquainted. This is a valid point to bring up, because this argument at least inadvertently touches on quite a few points we Badgers need to continuously discuss. Whether this crime is coming from people outside of the UW-Madison community or from people within it, the search for solutions should be continuous. That doesn’t excuse the promotion of tactics that merely make us feel comfortable. These will do nothing to find the root cause of crimes. Hookstead obviously doesn’t see how various crimes intersect with each other. He publishes sexist thoughts and simultaneously advocates for increasing access to guns for students, yet it doesn’t seem he realizes guns are also tools for intimate partner violence with about a third of all UW-Madison students have reported experiencing it in some form. We also don’t want these crimes to allow us to justify extreme tactics to solve them.Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",David Hookstead needs to shut up,UWM

I nodded in agreement, and we entered the bar.Sgt. Scott Kleinfeldt, a Madison Police Department Community Policing Team member, allowed me to ride along with him during his 5 p.m. to 3 a.m. patrol of the State Street area Oct. 12. His first stop was Hawk’s Bar and Grill, which was jam-packed with people dancing, sitting and, of course, drinking.Kleinfeldt began asking for the IDs of several baby-faced drinkers. As Kleinfeldt expected, they were underage.Seventy people scuttled out of the bar after we entered, according to one of the officers at the exit. Hawk’s has a capacity of 99.“What does that say when over half the people leave a bar when they see a cop?” Kleinfeldt asked, scribbling down case notes. “We’ll definitely be coming back here.”The officers confiscated four fake IDs from fleeing individuals brazen enough to show them to the cops. Collectively, the number of underage drinkers running out of Hawk’s was too much for the officers to stop.“They were coming out in packs of sixes and sevens,” one officer reported. “There were several who ran into the bathrooms, and I didn’t bother chasing them.”One officer expertly summed up the night—which not only followed a Badger win against Northwestern, but was also Homecoming weekend—when he said, “You’d have to be sober to stand out in this crowd.”Kleinfeldt said his typical night involves tavern inspections, which includes officers entering bars to check if they are over capacity, making sure bouncers are checking IDs, seeing if the bartenders are over-serving patrons and checking for underage drinkers.The officers then present their findings to the bar owners and tell them to fix the problems. The bars could face fines and potential action from the Alcohol License Review Committee if they do not implement policies to prevent underage drinkers from entering the bar.“We aren’t looking to bust people,” Kleinfeldt said. “Our biggest concern is safety.”Kleinfeldt stressed that a student’s first concern should be safety, not worrying about a ticket.The police are not asking students to be perfect, Kleinfeldt said. He described a number of scenarios where overly intoxicated students were alone and were mugged or sexually assaulted.“If you’re with friends and being helped home, I’m not going to stop you,” Kleinfeldt said. “It’s when you’re stumbling alone that it becomes a concern.”Kleinfeldt proved his convictions when we drove past a group of students who were holding up their intoxicated friend. “Are you taking him home?” Kleinfeldt asked through a rolled-down window. The students holding their friend managed to stutter “Yes.” Kleinfeldt responded with, “OK, bring him home now,” and continued to drive, ignoring the possible ticket.Almost immediately after the sergeant finished describing a scenario of what could happen if students do not have friends with them while intoxicated, he received a call from outside Madhatters.Two squad cars and an ambulance were already at the scene. The incident involved an overly intoxicated girl being left by her friends in the middle of West Gorham Street because they could not take care of her.During the ride along there were only a couple F-bombs slurred toward Kleinfeldt, all after he asked them not to sit in the street. A majority of the inebriated State Street crowd was friendly, and there were several instances of students approaching Kleinfeldt and asking for directions, phone chargers or just to say “Hi.”Kleinfeldt explained how half of his job is establishing a rapport with students. He described a situation in which he went out of his way to give a ride to a drunken student who was alone and made sure there was someone at the house to take care of him instead of giving a ticket.“Little gestures can go a long way,” Kleinfeldt said. “Even something like talking with a student early in the evening might prevent them from doing something regrettable in the future.”",Out on the town with Madison police,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/10/letter-awareness-of-domestic-abuse-is-crucial,"October 6, 2013 | 10:12pm CDT","While October is a busy month for most students on campus with midterms approaching and football games in full swing, it is an even busier month for Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment.PAVE is a student-run organization dedicated to ending sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking through education and activism. This month is very significant to PAVE’s work because October has been nationally recognized as Domestic Violence Awareness Month since 1987 to increase public awareness and spur action to end domestic violence. PAVE’s work to end domestic violence (or intimate partner violence) on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus culminates in October. Many students, however, think that dating violence is not an issue that is relevant to their lives. However, statistics from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence show that one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime and women aged 20-24 years are at the highest risk.It is important to note that it is possible for anyone, regardless of sex, gender, race, class, sexual orientation, dis/ability, etc., to be affected by domestic violence. It is for this reason that PAVE and many other organizations offer a very broad definition of intimate partner violence. It is an ongoing pattern of behavior in a relationship where one person exerts power and control over the other. The term “intimate partner violence” is also more inclusive of the different relationships students in a college environment may identify with.It is also important to remember physical violence is not the only form of abuse. Emotional, verbal or sexual abuse can occur as well, and also have long lasting effects on the victim or survivor. The psychological effects of intimate partner violence are incredibly hard to expunge. In addition to worrying about all of the stresses of school, those experiencing intimate partner violence experience fear and blame, and many other distressing emotions.Next time you are sitting in class, look around. Think about how many of your fellow Badgers may be survivors of (or are currently involved in) an abusive relationship. While this is scary to think about, it is also why PAVE is so dedicated to this cause.If you are concerned that you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship, the following behaviors can be red flags: intimidation, destroying property, name calling, mind games, isolation from other friends, extreme jealousy, denial or minimizing of the abuse, controlling money, making all the decisions or coercian. Abuse can look very different in different kinds of relationships.PAVE believes that everyone should be aware of intimate partner violence and also know about the resources available to survivors and friends of survivors here in Madison. We hope that everyone knows that it is okay to ask for help in these kinds of situations and that we can all work towards creating a safer community for survivors of abuse.In recognition of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, join PAVE and other ally organizations on campus on Monday, Oct. 7th from 11:00a.m.-3:00p.m. at East Campus Mall as we aim to create a campus free from intimate partner violence. PAVE will be passing out pledges you can sign to show your support of survivors of intimate partner violence and of healthy relationships as well.You can also get involved with PAVE on Tuesday, Oct. 22, as Dr. Josie Lehrer, creator of the Men’s Story Project, will join us for an interactive discussion exploring the ways for men to get involved in ending intimate partner violence.If you think you or a friend might need help, you can call the Rape Crisis Center at 608-251-7273 or Domestic Abuse Intervention Services at 608-251-4445. University Health Services (608-265-5600) and the UW Police Department (608-264-2677) are also great resources for students looking for help.What do you think is another good way to work together toward the end of domestic violence on University of Wisconsin- Madison’s campus?

She said the bill could allow police officers to concentrate on more important problems than underage drinking.“They’ll be able to focus on more things like sexual assault and … dangers on campus instead of drinking problems all the time,” Laning said.At the meeting Chair Morgan Rae also gave an update on the F50 campaign, which hopes to give students more power over decisions about distributing segregated fees.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/09/blurred-lines-creates-dangerously-blurred-lines-for-sexual-assault,"September 11, 2013 | 2:16am CDT","The song “Blurred Lines,” by Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams, which has been at the top of the American charts for weeks, is a perfect example of how American popular culture promotes rape and sexual violence against women. The song has grown famous for its extremely offensive lyrics and a music video so sexually explicit YouTube has blocked it. Aside from this, the song features lines that objectify and degrade women, and suggest that women’s voices simply don’t matter.The song talks about one particular woman as if she is purely a sexual object who was only put on this earth to look hot, dance around and have sex with men.Take the most famous line in the song, “I know you want it,” for example. The lyrics are implying very clearly that even when a woman says “no,” it really can mean “yes,” so you don’t actually have to listen to her when she says “no.”This frame of mind that you can take a woman’s “no” as insignificant is not just wrong but also against the law. Rape is a simple concept. It is sex without consent. Sorry boys, but in a court of law, the excuse, “She said no, but I know she wanted it,” just isn’t going to go over very well with the jury.Aside from the degrading lyrics, the music video also features naked women prancing around the three men, Thicke, T.I. and Williams, who are of course, completely clothed. The music video portrays the women as sexual objects that belong to the men, and their only purpose is to please them.Portraying women as sexual objects suggests to women that their voices don’t matter and their only worth in society is in their attractiveness and sex appeal. It also teaches men that they can treat women however they want, thus promoting and condoning rape and sexual violence against women.Robin Thicke even admits in a GQ interview they are degrading the women in the music video, but that it’s okay because he really does respect women. “People say, ‘Hey, do you think this is degrading to women?’ I’m like, ‘Of course it is. What a pleasure it is to degrade a woman. I’ve never gotten to do that before. I’ve always respected women,” Thicke said.Thicke also said in the interview that because the three of them (him, T.I. and Williams) are married with children, the song’s message is not misogynistic at all, and they are “the perfect guys to make fun of this.” So apparently disrespecting women is totally justified if you’re married with children.Degrading women through music and media outlets, even if it is “just for fun,” is extremely dangerous. The population gets used to the idea that women are worthless and their voices don’t count, and rape is no longer taken seriously. Suddenly there are “blurred lines” in rape, and it is a woman’s fault if she is raped. It is because she dressed a certain way or seduced the guy or acted like she wanted it. In reality though, none of these excuses for rape are ever valid. Rape is something that needs to be taken seriously, because it is a serious problem, and “making fun” of it is something that will never be OK. Rape is one of those lines you don’t cross or even make blurry.Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",‘Blurred Lines’ creates dangerously blurred lines for sexual assault,UWM

The other approved campaigns pertained to topics such as tenants’ rights, sexual assault prevention and response as well as building relationships with officials at different University of Wisconsin-Madison schools and colleges. ASM Vice Chair Mia Akers, who will lead the campaign, introduced the Diversity Plan Campaign with Rep. Justin Bloesch, who serves on the Ad Hoc Diversity Planning Committee, Diversity Chair Jessica Behling and Rep. Courtney Jackson. According to Bloesch, the university’s former diversity plan expired in 2008 and was not replaced. Although UW-Madison has a program called “Inclusive Excellence” that addresses diversity, Bloesch said there are many reasons the university needs another comprehensive plan. For instance, he said many minority groups are still underrepresented on campus. The ad hoc committee, which is composed of UW-Madison students, staff and faculty, is still in the process of gathering student feedback about diversity on campus. Bloesch said they will hold events like “listening sessions” to hear input. ASM and other governing bodies will need to approve the Diversity Plan. Before ASM gives their okay, Akers said student government officials will create a set of items they want to see included that reflect the desires of the student body.Bloesch said within the ad hoc Committee, he is part of a group considering adding an academic requirement to the Diversity Plan. Two possible examples of this could be a revamped ethnic studies requirement or a group where students discuss the experience of being on campus with students from different backgrounds, according to Bloesch. The ASM campaign will gather criteria by encouraging students to participate in the ad hoc committee’s feedback process, as well as asking for input directly from students. Akers said it is crucial students’ voices be represented. “Hopefully every student here benefits from diversity and every student benefits from having a functioning diversity plan,” Akers said. ASM also unanimously passed a resolution encouraging Dane County Board members to restore funding to the Tenant Resource Center, which offers services such as free counseling about rental rights and responsibilities. In August, the Dane County Human Services Director recommended cutting funding to certain services. Student Services Finance Committee Chair David Vines, who proposed the amendment, said the Tenant Resource Center is an important resource for students. Student Council also elected Rep. Sarah Neibart as Shared Governance Chair. She replaces Sean McNally, who resigned from the position due to health reasons. Neibart formerly served as ASM Chief of Staff and as an SSFC chair. “I’m really excited,” Neibart said. “I think shared governance is really incredible… it gives students a profound opportunity to take responsibility and be active participants in their own governance.”At the next meeting on Sept. 11, representatives will discuss an affordability campaign they elected to postpone for a week.

SSFC makes recommendations about how the University should distribute certain tuition fees to student organizations. The second branch, the Student Judiciary, resolves disputes between ASM and other parties.Lastly, Student Council officially represents the student body by reviewing proposed policies, among other duties. Twelve committees are part of Student Council, including Diversity Committee, Legislative Affairs and the newly formed Sustainability Committee.Students must be elected to the general Student Council by the student body, but most committees, which spearhead grassroots campaigns, are open to all students to participate. ASM Press Office Director Grace Bolt said she considers committees “the core” of ASM.Last year, a Diversity Committee campaign led to the creation of a university policy that now allows transgender individuals and international students to change their names on class lists if they prefer a name different from their legal one.Two other campaigns introduced bills that are currently being discussed in the state legislature. One bill would protect students from penalties such as underage drinking citations if they contacted authorities to report an emergency and the other bill would give students more input in the selection of the student regent on the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents.The agenda for ASM’s next session has not yet been decided, but according to Bolt, possible campaigns may focus on tenant rights, mental health and sexual assault prevention.Legislative Affairs Chair Morgan Rae said her committee will tackle student loan reform in the upcoming year.

Blank also said she hopes to announce a more defined list of initiatives dealing with these issues by the end of her first year as chancellor.“UW-Madison is an absolutely first-rate school, which is facing the challenges that all public universities are facing—some of which are funding challenges, some of which are competition from the top [private universities], which are just raising gads of money, therefore being harder to compete with,” Blank said.A special committee of the University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents recommended Blank for the position after a search and screening committee chose four finalists. Blank was also a finalist for the position in 2008 when Martin received the job.University officials pointed to her experience in a variety of challenging positions as well as her leadership roles at larger institutions as important factors in her hire.Blank is presently the acting U.S. Secretary of Commerce and has a PhD in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Prior to her work in government, Blank was a visiting fellow at UW–Madison’s Department of Economics and Institute for Research on Poverty in 1985 before moving on to teaching positions at MIT, Princeton University, Northwestern University and the University of Michigan.

The board also works with state legislators to accomplish their goals.The UW System and Board of Regents were recently involved in widespread controversy after an audit revealed the UW System was operating with approximately $648 million in unrestricted surplus revenue.UW System President Kevin Reilly and the Board of Regents argue the large surplus was necessary to maintain the quality of the state’s universities. However, it drew heavy criticism from state legislators, who said the excess money proved the system was running ineffectively.A particular point of controversy for legislators came from approximately $414 million of the $648 million derived from student tuition payments, which the board argued was within their usual surplus amounts.—Megan StoebigASM Chair David GardnerPulling in two-thirds of the Student Council vote in a May election, David Gardner was elected as chair of the Associated Students of Madison for the 2013-’14 academic year.ASM is the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s student government and officially represents the student body.

Akers’ supporters included several Diversity Committee members and United Council Vice President Beth Huang, while Niebart was supported by former SSFC Chair Ellie Bruecker and former Shared Governance Chair Britt Moes.Akers said her goals for next year include ensuring different campaigns work collaboratively, sending large groups of students to conferences and conventions, in addition to reaching out to the student body.“I really just want to continue to fight for students, whether it’s student debt or whether it’s working with the campus diversity plan,” Akers said. “I want to make sure the student voice is still preserved and student autonomy is still being fought for.”Council also voted to appoint five other officers, including Rep.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/05/cramming-for-the-end-of-the-year,"May 5, 2013 | 11:02pm CDT","This editorial board went over some of the biggest issues this year and looked back to see if there were any lessons to be learned.Shared governanceWhen Chancellor David Ward went against the Student Services Finance Committee’s recommendation to freeze the Wisconsin Union and Recreational Sports’ budgets for this fiscal year, he inspired a snowball of debate among shared governance groups on campus that culminated in threats of a lawsuit between students and the chancellor. Shared governance provides the opportunity for discussion among students, faculty and staff on campuses throughout Wisconsin. This opportunity is fairly unique to University of Wisconsin schools, with only a few other schools in the nation providing students an official say in the inner-workings of their education. So while the chancellor does officially have the right to veto decisions made within the Associated Students of Madison, he or she should recognize they have the unique responsibility to discuss such matters with student leaders and value student opinions with significant weight.As the incoming chancellor of the university, Rebecca Blank needs to realize ASM and other shared governance bodies make the decisions they do for a reason. While she will likely not agree with all of these decisions, she still needs to respect the authority these bodies are afforded through shared governance. Overruling decisions they make should only be done after much thought and deliberation with all parties involved.This unique opportunity for shared governance unfortunately has the potential to pin university stakeholders against one another, as witnessed with the Union and RecSports budgets. Shared governance should be a benefit to the university, not a source of contention. In order for it to be so, however, all bodies must be willing to work together.Getting to know incoming Chancellor Rebecca BlankThe University of Wisconsin-Madison might be comprised of 40,000 students, but each one of us wants to know our university cares about us. This starts with the chancellor.We strongly encourage Rebecca Blank to think about ways to reach out to us, the students. It will be a challenge. It will take creativity. But it will make the Badger experience even more special and personal.If Blank wants an example of a great way to engage students, she should take a page out of former Chancellor Biddy Martin’s book. Everything from her name—we referred to her simply as “Biddy”—to her efforts to reach us through social media made it feel as though she was the chancellor of a university with 4,000 students, rather than one with 40,000.Blank can effectively use social media, especially Twitter and Facebook, to reach out to us. We are all connected online as Badgers, and it is especially important our chancellor connects with us as well. We don’t just want Blank to feel like our chancellor, we want her to feel like a fellow Badger. We want to feel like she is as passionate about UW-Madison as we are.Getting to know us is also as simple as showing up to events. Go to the All Campus Party. Go to Diversity Week. Go to Bascom Hill on snow days (and please call snow days. We will love you for it).It comes down to this: We want to know you.Having an engaged chancellor is good for our image. People often wonder what it means to be a Badger. Being a Badger means having pride in this institution. It means not being able to imagine going anywhere else for college. We want Blank to show us she shares this passion.It is good for our university’s recruitment. One of the primary concerns prospective students have about UW-Madison is how big it is. It is hard to imagine a university this large taking a vested interest in us. Blank has the opportunity to make this notion a misconception.Simply put, it will make us a better school. Badgers love community. We love our campus. We love what our university stands for. We can’t wait to share this campus with Rebecca Blank.Budget SurplusThe recent revelation that the UW system had nearly $1 billion in reserves came to a shock to many, especially the state Republicans. This resulted in some calling for a tuition freeze and has generated more distrust between state Republicans and the university.There is a lesson to be learned here for incoming chancellor Rebecca Blank, and it is the importance of getting along with state government. First things first, the reserve is a good thing. Any smart organization is going to have a way to handle a disaster financially, and the UW System must be no different. We encourage keeping the reserves up for the good of the system. Furthermore, the knowledge that the system is in the money—something no one should really be surprised about—does not necessitate a tuition freeze. This board hopes for lower tuition as much as anyone else, but we also understand that the university needs funding if it wants to improve. With little hope of increased funding from the state, the university needs the flexibility to fund its operations.All this being said, the important lesson to be learned is to improve the university’s public relations. There is no reason state officials should not have known about the reserves beforehand. There is no reason everyone associated with the system didn’t know about it. Furthermore, students and parents alike are shelling out hard-earned money, and they deserve to know how their money is spent.Openness within government is vital to protect citizens, but also vital for a government to run smoothly. By letting state officials find out about the billion dollar reserves by themselves, it shocked them. It made them act hastily, and now Democrats and Republicans are talking about tuition freezes, which as we state is not the idea the UW System needs.The university lost its chance to become more independent when the Biddy Martin plan failed, and now it needs to work with the state to make the public higher education system in Wisconsin work.This boils down to improving the public relations and government relations team at the university. The university is dealing with a skeptical public and increasingly skeptical state Republicans. Work with them; in fact, work twice as hard. Because if the university doesn’t get in good with the government, the university is only going to suffer.Sexual Assault AwarenessRecently, a UW-Madison alumna came forward with her experience of sexual assault. Her story spoke of poor support and lack of interest at the hands of the university. While it did not mirror the mishandlings at Amherst College and Duke University, it certainly did not reach the standard one would expect from UW-Madison.Sexual assault is a unique crime,and must be dealt with as such. Oftentimes it is embarrassing for the victim and emotionally damaging to a crippling degree. As such, handling the situation should be its own unique process as well. As it stands, not many students know the university to be as large of a resource as it is. Reporting sexual assault to the university allows the victim to remain anonymous, while reporting the crime to the police does not. While we always condone going to the police when assaulted, we understand the potential desire to remain anonymous as a victim.This being said, it is critical that the university and UHS present themselves as a resource for those assaulted. If the university can spend the money to print posters stressing the importance of locking your doors, they can certainly afford to print posters presenting the signs of assault and the resources for the victims. Similarly, UHS could add a tab on their website pertaining to the recognition of sexual assault. Awareness is the most important step in prevention, and having a resource simply as an extension of wisc.edu is a simple change that could make a big difference. Even at SOAR, there should be a seminar on the signs, effects and places an individual can go to receive support and potential prosecution for their assaulter. If it happens on campus, which it does here as it does at all college campuses, incoming freshmen should be prepared.With the drinking culture that undoubtedly exists at this university, knowing the potential for assault is crucial and should remain on every individual’s mind, regardless of gender. If one chooses to go to the police, which should not be an intimidating option for the victim, they should have the option to remain anonymous in the report. As it stands now, this is not the case. While this system is fine for theft crimes, sexual assault is in its own category, and a level of anonymity must be maintained if the victim so chooses. The prosecution rate for sexual assault is high if it is reported soon after the event. While this is a traumatic experience for the victim, going through the proper procedures to prosecute a predator is a necessary step, both toward healing and eliminating the potential for that individual to assault another.There is no reason for the university not to act on promoting awareness of itself as a resource for the victims of sexual assault. If printing posters and speaking about sexual assault at orientation prevent even one case of this traumatic crime, it will be worth it.Diversity at UW-MadisonEarlier this semester, the Associated Students of Madison had a week-long series of events consisting of their diversity week. Unfortunately, student turnout at most of the events was very low. When a student-organized event fails to draw attendees, there could be dozens of different reasons: marketing, an event’s timing or topic, the location etc. This board began asking why ASM’s diversity week had such a disappointing turn-out, but we began to address a larger question: What does it mean for a campus to be diverse, and what can the university do to encourage diversity?UW-Madison pays someone to ask themselves these questions: Chief Diversity Officer Damon Williams. Last year, this board witnessed Williams’ inspiring students to stand—perhaps too vigorously—against a report from the conservative think tank the Center for Equal Opportunity, which accused UW-Madison of unfairly rejecting white and Asian-American applicants. The CEO protests inspired outrage and vitriol, but where was Williams during Diversity Week? Williams and his office need to be more engaged in day-to-day campus life.We don’t think Williams’ mere presence is going to increase diversity. In fact, defining diversity and attempting to achieve it are challenging tasks. This board wants to see the university embrace a more objective approach to improving diversity on campus. This can be achieved by setting specific goals. For example, minority students are frequently the only representative of their race in many of their classes. This shouldn’t be the case. Another metric this board found useful is the difference between racial groups’ dropout and four-year graduation rates. Accepting objective measures takes much of the complexity out of race-related issues. This reduced-complexity isn’t great for discourse but might be necessary for policy decisions.Achieving diversity is more confusing than measuring it. This board thinks many of the initiatives currently on campus are counter-productive. For example, the international diversity floor probably produces a lot of knowledgeable students, but its existence reduces the amount of diversity everywhere else on campus. By touting diversity, this floor actually increases segregation. Likewise, the cleavage of UW-Madison’s Greek communities into basically a white and Jewish system and a black/Hispanic/Asian system is incredibly counterproductive. We understand fraternities and sororities can exist for a variety of different reasons, but Greek organizations should be overseen according to their classification (social, professional etc.) instead of the make-up of their members. Also, we understand the desire to find a community in people who look alike and perhaps have a common background with you. But ultimately, the multicultural greek organizations represent a form of damaging self-segregation. If the amount of non-white students on campus was larger, there would be less need for these self-segregating communities. Until then, these organizations should be pushed by the university and themselves to take an active part in the larger UW-Madison community. This board doesn’t want to judge these groups as negative forces on campus, because they certainly aren’t, but we believe their structure reflects some of the self-defeating initiatives surrounding increasing diversity.The university needs to acknowledge its role—in front of student organizations—as being responsible for preparing students to enter the diverse world as competent and knowledgeable citizens. Teaching diversity and multicultural tolerance can be done in the classroom, but this board believes events such as ASM’s diversity week are just as valuable. The university should create one or two prerequisite classes, one to be taken as a freshman or sophomore, the other as a junior or senior. These one-credit classes would require the enrolled student to attend 4-5 diversity related events throughout the course of the semester put on by a registered student organization and write a report on their experience for the end of the semester. These classes wouldn’t be so strenuous someone couldn’t fit them into their schedule and would encourage students to engage in various events on campus while learning about citizenship and diversity. This is just one in an infinite number of ways the university could better acknowledge its role in cultivating a diverse climate and graduating well-rounded citizens ready for a multicultural world.Overall, the university needs to step back and reevaluate the goals and needs of increasing diversity. After a firm reevaluation, the university can begin to take a more effective and proactive take on increasing diversity here in Madison.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/05/tradition-of-mifflin-twisted-and-convoluted,"May 3, 2013 | 1:21am CDT","The city’s Mifflin full-court press has dealt dismay to the hearts of thousands who pine for gluttonous amounts of racist neon tanktops and a spectrum of liquor in spring jubilation. Granted, in a world where social media reigns supreme, the people weren’t pleased and didn’t hesitate to respond. People are pissed at the fact their grandiose spectacle has been revoked from them. It’s not Badger-like, it’s not fair and it’s unnecessary.And in all of this hoopla, I feel like the only person on campus who doesn’t give a fuck Mifflin got the axe.Allow me to address the majority now by admitting the following: No, I am not of drinking age. Yes, I choose not to drink at all despite what the culture of this city expects of me. Yes, I am performing at Revelry this weekend. No, I do not think it is proper the way the city is handling the situation in a tyrannical method from a situation they exacerbated themselves. And no, I do not care what you as a human  choose to do with your leisure or splendor time as long as you are not harming others or yourself.With these opinions public, I’m not going to reiterate the diatribes of past columns I’ve seen on this issue. What we must do now is meditate on what this all truly means, and why it is a saddening reflection on us as a collective entity of a student body.First and foremost, I went to the watered-down Mifflin last year as a freshman. (You might have seen my anti-racist tee amidst the sombreros on the backs of others.) In my brief immersion in the party culture here, all I heard about was how amazing a spectacle Mifflin is and how it makes him, her and them proud to be Badgers, exercising their liberties while contributing to the “work hard, play hard” mythos.Frankly, it was some ol’ bullshit. It was one of the most sickening displays of collective white privilege I’ve ever seen, and when you combine that with the horrific experience of being sober in a horde of people who aren’t, and don’t give a single damn for your regard whilst in the state they’re in, so many feelings set in at once. I had to distance myself. I couldn’t deal with the lengths people go to, and who was at expense in the process.With that experience in pocket, it’s time to address the line of thinking we need to begin questioning as students and as a social culture. There is absolutely no doubt we bring in money for the university with the social life as a primary aspect, but is that merely enough to endorse and embody the ignorance and reckless abandon we reinforce by allowing rape culture, white privilege and a history of violent behaviors to continue? And I don’t just mean the two stabbings from years previous, I mean the trend of unaccounted incidents involving racial slurs, sexual assaults, street fights and so forth. I’ve never been called a nigger until I came here. My friends have ended up in fights with drunken people and statistically, chances are we all know someone who has been sexually assaulted.Furthermore, I’m tired of hearing Mifflin embodies the spirit of what we are as Badgers. That is a sickening lie. If this is the case, to outsiders, it seems as if 40,000 people are privileged drunkards with little-to-no cultural competency who will sleep with whomever they desire at whatever cost. Obviously this is not true. You know it, I know it.In fact, Mifflin, in its current iteration, is the absolute opposite of what we supposedly stand for. And this isn’t based on university expectation of students; I’m speaking on the mythos we love to uphold when it’s convenient. Everyone knows this originated as a protest of the Vietnam War. And look at what we stand for now. But when the city is forced to act upon us, some take the bold initiative to attempt to cause another revolution via Facebook, as if Mifflin is worth saving and a priority to move for. We are not characterized by the bastardized shitshow we place upon a pedestal. If we are, then what have we become?We did not create these problems. Hedonistic desire is inherently embedded in American identity as a whole. College drinking culture is a product of this as well. But if we as Badgers, who take so much pride in ourselves and will defend our name to the grave, continue to reinforce these principles, then our prestige is diluted to nothing.  If Mifflin is what makes us Badgers, then it is damn well time to rethink what being a Badger means.Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Tradition of Mifflin twisted and convoluted,UWM

Kelly Donahue said. She added amplified music and loitering in the street are also prohibited.Madison Fire Department Division Chief Ronald Schwenn added “five-square-feet between people” is the limit on porches for safety reasons.Police echoed Schwenn’s safety concerns. Officers said they will target those who supply alcohol to minors, and added hosts charging people to drink draws police attention and increases the likelihood of being cited.“Citations and safety are intertwined,” MPD Lt. Dave McCaw said. “[We’re] going after dealers at these house parties, trying to limit the number of intoxicated people.”He cited past incidents ranging from sexual assaults to people falling off balconies, and said they were all alcohol related.Many students in attendance did not seem satisfied with the intentions of the police, as University of Wisconsin-Madison fifth-year student Luke Schmidt attested to. He called the tactics used by police in 2012 “extremely aggressive.”“The stuff I saw last year was absolutely absurd,” Schmidt said. “It was way out of line.”He referenced an incident witnessed last year where police allegedly “hogtied” a girl for stepping into the street while carrying a beer.Ald. Mike Verveer, District 4, wanted to dispel any “misconceptions” Mifflin residents had about this year’s festivities.“People should feel comfortable in their own house with a few friends,” Verveer said. “As long as you follow the rules, you’ll have no problems with the police.”","City officials, MPD address lingering Mifflin concerns",UWM

His plan reappropriates city money for use in summer youth programs, such as full-time summer camps, by using a portion or all of the nearly $190,000 Mifflin cost the city last year.“[With all those funds] we could basically get 100 kids into a day camp for the summer,” Soglin said.Soglin used a large prop check made out to “Youth Summer Programs” with “Reinvestment from Mifflin Block Party Funds” written on the memo line to illustrate his point during the meeting.“Over here we've got a check. Right now it's made out for $190,000,” Soglin said. “That represents the costs for law enforcement for the Mifflin Street Block Party.”Soglin also emphasized the issues the Mifflin Street Block Party causes, which he said include increased sexual assaults, excessive alcohol consumption and physical violence.“If anyone in this community, starting with students, wants to have a safe, reasonable party that is just fine, but we can't have a continuation of what has been going on the last couple of years,” Soglin said. “We can't have that risk to the health and safety of the participants and those who attend.”Madison Police Department Chief Noble Wray, who also spoke at the press conference, responded to the controversy surrounding the expected increase of police enforcement this year. Wray insisted MPD will act similarly to last year.“Our enforcement posture is going to be the same,” Wray said. “We will hold people accountable for their actions.”Soglin also responded to student outcries that they are not being allowed to carry on the student tradition of throwing a party on Mifflin.“Yes, there is a right to party, but that right to party can't infringe upon the safety of others and it shouldn't infringe upon our concern for city resources,” Soglin said.",Soglin outlines plans for reinvestment of Mifflin policing costs,UWM

According to Angyal, these movies portray the persistent advances of men despite a woman’s objection as romantic, and condone ignoring a woman when she says “no.”“Men are taught to believe that if you just push hard enough and long enough, she will eventually come around,” Angyal said.Angyal also said she believes the media and popular culture have a significant impact on the way people view sexual assault.DeGroot, a University of Wisconsin-Madison senior, discussed the UW Confessions page, and how many sexual assault victims who have spoken out on the page have been accused of “asking for it.” She said these views support a victim-blaming culture where rapists are not held accountable for their crimes, which is what PAVE attempts to eliminate.The panelists also discussed how to prevent sexual assault by educating teens on consent and bystander intervention. According to Maxwell, many bystanders do not know how to step in to help victims, which she said needs to change.The panelists all agreed the best way to handle sexual assault prevention is to teach men not to rape, rather than to tell women how to dress, to avoid drinking alcohol or to carry a gun.",PAVE hosts feminist bloggers on sexual assault panel,UWM

After a judge released the alleged perpetrator on bail, he returned to his residence next door to Isabella’s house.“You can imagine how much anxiety it was causing the family to have the perpetrator of this horrible crime back next door, looking out his window at the back yard where Isabella plays,” Mason said.Weatherston said although Isabella’s alleged assaulter confessed to the crime, the judge and district attorney in the case currently have no power to restrict where a suspect placed on bail can live.“This bill [would give] that power back to those authorities so they can put in place restrictions and it be a condition of [perpetrators’] bail,” he said.Mason said sexual assault laws do not give enough thought to the victim in each step of the process.“This bill isn’t going to change what happened to Isabella, but it can stop any future Isabellas from being victimized this way,” he said.","Lawmakers announce ""Isabella's Law"" to protect child sexual assault victims",UWM

While we, the Campus Women’s Center, commend the Cardinal for running the piece, the article unfortunately became a part of the issue that it was attempting to confront, that of victim-blaming and slut-shaming. The second sentence in the article states “A member of the crew team and ‘very religious,’ she rarely drank and planned to remain a virgin until she married her then-boyfriend of four years.” While true of this survivor, the framework set up by this sentence suggests to the reader that the survivor was a “good girl” who did not “deserve” what happened to her. When discussing sexual assault it is extremely important to note that the victim is never at fault. Their drinking habits, appearance and religion are irrelevant. The sentence implies that some victims of sexual assault may be “asking for it” and can be blamed more than others. The opening of the article contradicts the message we believe the Cardinal was attempting to convey: that sexual assault under any circumstances is unacceptable.We hope The Daily Cardinal continues to address issues like sexual assault on campus in a thoughtful and responsible manner. That includes accompanying any articles with campus resources such as The Dean of Students Office or the Rape Crisis Center. The Rape Crisis Center has a 24-hour hotline that can be reached at 608-251-7273, additionally they have an office on the 6th floor of the SAC.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/04/victim-into-advocate-one-sexual-assault-survivors-fight-for-justice,"April 11, 2013 | 2:18am CDT","This is the second story in a two-part series spotlighting sexual assault survivor Laura Dunn, a 2007 University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate, who became a primary advocate for the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law March 7 under the Violence Against Women Act.Laura Dunn was working for Teach For America in New Orleans when she received a letter from the U.S. Department of Education. She immediately skipped to the last page, and what she read left her devastated.She read the conclusion of the Title IX complaint she filed against University of Wisconsin-Madison after she felt officials did not conduct a “prompt and appropriate” investigation into her sexual assault that occurred April 4, 2004. The DOE’s Office for Civil Rights concluded there was “insufficient evidence” to rule UW-Madison guilty.“I was in the next phase of my life,” Dunn said. “And it was just another door slammed.”UW-Madison exonerated Dunn’s perpetrator due to a lack of “clear and convincing” evidence, which Associate Dean of Students Kevin Helmkamp said was partially because Dunn reported her assault 15 months after it occurred. This was the standard for evidence for indicating sexual assault until 2011, when Helmkamp said the standard in sexual assault cases changed to preponderance—meaning a claimant must show a greater weight of evidence toward his or her claim than against it.“Once we reach that evidentiary standard, it would be one-year suspension, at the minimum,” Helmkamp said. He added that setting standards for evidence is necessary due to the severity of the consequence one may face after perpetrating sexual assault, which often results in a two-year suspension or expulsion.Dunn’s luck changed after the Center for Public Integrity spotlighted her in an investigation about Title IX complaints regarding the way universities handle sexual assault cases. Soon after the report was released, the DOE released the “Dear Colleague” Letter, which clearly defines how universities should handle sexual assault incidents and investigations. Dunn said there was a direct correlation.“The Title IX rewrite is very strong,” Dunn said. “It really calls out universities’ practices that discourage or delay campus victims’ justice.”But Dunn, still dissatisfied, took her fight for justice to Washington.Taking the fight to WashingtonIn August 2011, Dunn flew to Washington D.C. to begin law school at the University of Maryland, located in Baltimore. Before she even settled in her new residence, Dunn visited the U.S. Senate offices along with representatives from various sexual assault prevention advocacy organizations to change the way universities handle sexual assault cases.After nearly two years, the efforts resulted in the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act.When Campus SaVE was introduced as Section 304 under the then-proposed Violence Against Women Act, Dunn said she thought her work was complete, noting how the issue of sexual assault typically has a history of unanimous bipartisan support. But to her disappointment, the bill expired when Congress’s last session ended Jan. 3, 2013 after a legislative stalemate.U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., quickly reintroduced Campus SaVE to Congress when the session started up again, and the U.S. Senate passed the bill shortly after.Dunn spoke at a Feb. 26 press conference held by U.S. Rep. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to push the House of Representatives to reauthorize VAWA. Listening to Dunn speak, one could sense the anger and frustration—even the hurt—in her shaken voice.“Justice delayed is justice denied,” Dunn said at the press conference, according to footage. “The Senate realized this and took bipartisan efforts to pass this legislation, which is about justice, not politics.”Two days later, Congress passed VAWA, and with it, Campus SaVE. Dunn was there when President Barack Obama signed VAWA into law March 7.Campus SaVE detailedDunn said Campus SaVE, which will take effect in the 2014-15 academic year, will make the sexual assault investigative process more “even-handed” by requiring universities to provide information about the investigation to both parties involved at the same time. It also creates a new process for victims to be given the same appealing rights as their perpetrators.After UW-Madison’s investigation concluded, Dunn said the university exonerated her perpetrator before telling her of the investigation’s outcome, which made it impossible for her to appeal the university’s findings. Campus SaVE prevents such actions from happening.“This is the ideal. That there are standards that law protects the accused and gives them a fair process and really make sure victims have an opportunity for justice,” Dunn said. “That’s the lasting effect.”The new bill also requires universities to provide victims with their written rights, which include university assistance in reporting a crime, changing “hostile” living environments as well as offering counseling and health services.According to Assistant Dean of Students Tonya Schmidt, UW-Madison already follows most of the Campus SaVE policies. One policy the bill will change is that now, instead of delivering options and investigation details orally, officials will have to do so in writing.Campus SaVE also instructs universities to provide sexual assault prevention education for all incoming students and employees, including safe and positive bystander intervention techniques.UW-Madison educates all incoming students at Student Orientation and Registration, where first-year students spend an evening with student leaders discussing the definition of sexual assault and consent, as well as available resources on campus.“The Title IX guide and Campus SaVE—that’s my form of justice,” Dunn said. “Now I hope to turn around and start giving justice to others.”Not the answer, but a ‘very important first step’On Oct. 17, 2012, former Amherst College student Angie Epifano published an opinion piece in the college’s student newspaper, The Amherst Student, detailing her acquaintance rape on Amherst’s campus.The column also detailed the neglect she felt working with university officials after she reported her rape, as well as detailed her decision to leave Amherst, while her rapist graduated with honors, even after she reported him.The article gained national attention and generated thousands of comments. One day later on Oct. 18, Amherst President Carolyn “Biddy” Martin—the former UW-Madison chancellor—released a response letter. She stated, “The administration’s responses to reports have left survivors feeling that they were badly served. That must change, and change immediately.”Soon after, Amherst held panelled discussions, community meetings and days of silence. And in January 2013, the newly established Special Oversight Committee on Sexual Misconduct released a report called “Toward a Culture of Respect: The Problem of Sexual Misconduct at Amherst College,” which details the administration’s new, stricter approach in handling sexual assault cases.“They did everything to expose the culture of sexual violence,” Dunn said. “And that’s I what wish the university had done in my case and it’s what I still hope the university does.”Dunn said there could still be more done to expose and combat rape-supportive culture and hopes universities will eventually “fully accept” there is a cultural ignorance surrounding sexual assault and firmly address issues surrounding rape-supportive culture to the level Amherst College did in October 2012.“I think universities need to accept that this is a problem, rather than thinking it is something that comes up only every once in a blue moon,” Dunn said. “They need a culture that supports victims while they are on campus.”While Campus SaVE addresses issues surrounding the victim’s protection and enforces some sexual assault prevention education, Dunn said the legislation is only the beginning of combatting the larger culture surrounding campus sexual assault.“I don’t think Campus SaVE is the answer to the problem,” Dunn said. “But it is a very important first step.”Even with Campus SaVE implemented, Schmidt admitted UW-Madison still has room to grow. She said the Dean of Students Office is “not exactly being proactive” about advertising its services and encouraging victims to report.“I always tell people we need a marketer,” Schmidt said. “Because we are really busy responding to incidents.”Dunn said she thinks when universities recognize problems surrounding rape-supportive culture, “it just changes everything.”“It diminishes the silence, allows improved policies, it allows those who feel as though they have been victimized to feel like they have a place still at the university,” Dunn said. “That they can stay, and the university is paying attention now.”Dunn is now a law student at the University of Maryland and a legal intern for the Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of Legal Justice.",Victim into Advocate: One sexual assault survivor’s fight for justice,UWM

He said 5 percent of men on college campuses acknowledge committing acts that fit the legal definition of rape, and about 3 percent are serial rapists. He also found 91 percent of rapes are committed by serial rapists.Based on this assessment, he said a vast majority of men will not rape, and are the ones universities need to target for participation in prevention programs.“[Sexual assault] breeds here on university campuses,” Lisak said. “This is where it needs to be addressed and this is where young people need to learn about it, how it can be curtailed and prevented.”According to Lisak, there are many common misconceptions about sexual assault, including the assumption victims do not know their attackers, although a large portion of assaults occur from friends or acquaintances.Lisak said he hopes that after hearing his lecture, students will leave with a sense of mobilization to address current problems.“My fondest wish is that students … [are motivated] to do whatever they can,” Lisak said. “To not be passive or feel helpless, but to take this on however they can. To affect change.”",Sexual assault researcher David Lisak speaks with UW-Madison students,UWM

Sexual assault can be a form of domestic or intimate partner violence, and usually occurs between two people who know each other. Sexual assault often occurs in the form of forced vaginal or anal penetration, forced oral sex or unwanted bodily touching.Sexual assault is a matter of power and control and occurs when one individual believes themself to be superior and more powerful than another individual.  The sexual violence that arises out of these power dynamics is not restricted to men or straight couples, but also occurs in LGBTQ relationships.There are many myths that surround sexual assault. An example is the myth that rapes are perpetrated by strangers jumping out of bushes in the night, but we know the majority of the time it’s someone the victim knows.PAVE stresses the need for allies to combat rape-supportive culture. In this type of society, sexual violence is often considered to be “just something that happens” and widespread victim blaming. This is unacceptable, and sexual violence is never a victim’s fault. However, in a rape-supportive culture, there are some who don’t see it that way, and PAVE is working to combat that.Throughout April, PAVE is hosting a series of events to better inform students about sexual assault, how to support survivors and more. Some of these events include: A Day of Unity on April 10, a reading discussion on the Impact of Pornography on April 15 co-sponsored with Sex Out Loud and a panel with Feministing bloggers Zerlina Maxwell and Chloe Angyal on April 24.Sexual assault victims at the University of Wisconsin can call the Rape Crisis Center’s 24-hour hotline at 608-251-RAPE for immediate assistance. University Health Services also offers counseling, both scheduled and drop-in, for UW students who have been victims of sexual assault.Monday night at 7 p.m. in the PAVE Office at the Student Activity Center #3147, PAVE is hosting our General Member Meeting. Anyone looking to learn more about this issue and help out during this busy month is more than welcome to attend.PAVE is a student organization dedicated to preventing sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking on the UW-Madison campus through education and activism.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/04/from-victim-to-advocate-one-sexual-assault-survivor-shares-her-story,"April 4, 2013 | 3:14am CDT","This is the first story of a two-part series spotlighting sexual assault survivor Laura Dunn, a 2007 University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate who became a primary advocate for the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law March 7 under the Violence Against Women Act.Laura Dunn was a focused student when she was a UW-Madison freshman in 2004. A member of the crew team and “very religious,” she rarely drank and planned to remain a virgin until she married her then-boyfriend of four years.But nine years ago, on the night of April 4, 2004, Dunn’s college career took a dark turn when she entered a house party to drink with her new friends from the crew team.“I had a lot of shots with different members of the team,” Dunn said in an interview with The Daily Cardinal. “I was only a freshman. I was getting to know people.”It was only her second time drinking. Dunn became “very intoxicated” and her friends eventually cut her off from drinking. It was then when two of Dunn’s acquaintances on the male crew team offered to walk her to another party, which they said also involved crew team members.Both said they needed to stop at home quickly before heading to the other party, and Dunn followed. She realized they walked her slightly off campus, and Dunn “knew she was in danger” when one of the men grabbed her and forced her to kiss him.“I pleaded with them,” she said. “I told them I was not that kind of person.”The men proceeded to take her into one of their houses, where Dunn said they both sexually assaulted her.‘Rape-supportive culture’ on college campusesTo UW-Madison Sex Out Loud member Samantha Johnson, societal attitudes toward rape play a large role in enabling sexual assault.That is why she refers to the commonly used term “rape culture” as “rape-supportive culture”–because whether or not someone commits sexual assault, Johnson believes everyone still contributes to the culture surrounding rape and should not ignore his or her prevention responsibilities.To Johnson, “rape-supportive culture” on college campuses includes phrases tossed around such as, “My calculus exam raped me,” that trivialize the traumatizing crime sexual assault can be, while sayings including, “She’s asking for it in that short skirt,” support victim-blaming attitudes.“Rape-supportive culture” is also why one in four women will be victims of completed or attempted sexual assault during their college careers, Johnson said.Laura Dunn was part of that 25 percent.Dunn was unaware at first she was sexually assaulted and blamed herself for the incident. She kept quiet, and suffered for it. She became overwhelmed with stress encountering the perpetrators of her assault regularly at crew practice, her long-term relationship came to an end and she struggled academically.“It’s hard. I’ll say it that way,” Dunn said, unable to explain the thoughts she had after she was assaulted. “It’s hard to focus and it’s hard to get anything done. It’s hard to not have nightmares.”Most people assume sexual assaults are gruesome, physical attacks perpetrated by a stranger, according to Dunn. But according to The National Sexual Violence Resource Center, 80 percent of victims know their perpetrators before the assault.Dunn called acquaintance rape and alcohol-facilitated dating violence, which comprise the majority of sexual assault cases, “the thing you don’t see coming.” Eight of every 10 acquaintance rapes on college campuses are alcohol-related, according to the UW-Madison Police Department.Of the 122 sexual assaults reported to the UW-Madison Dean of Students’ office in 2012, 40 percent of them involved alcohol and 28 percent knew their perpetrator. In 2011, 46 percent of incidents involved alcohol, while 58 percent of victims knew their perpetrator.According to Dunn, when alcohol is involved, victim-blaming occurs because those assaulted feel it was their choice to drink. Additionally, she said it is difficult for victims to identify acquaintance rape and therefore hesitate to report their assaults to police, unaware they were victims of a crime.Most people are unaware that if overly intoxicated, an individual cannot provide consent, according to Johnson. When alcohol is involved upon engaging in sexual activity, both partners should be aware of signs such as slurring words, stumbling, vomiting and not being able to recall what happened five minutes ago, which indicate a person cannot provide consent.“It’s such an experience of the college atmosphere, to go out, drink and have sex,” Johnson said. “The two get so conflated and when you’ve drawn the line between tipsy and incapacitated, it’s no longer okay.”Soon after Dunn realized she was assaulted, she quit the crew team after the fall 2004 season to avoid her perpetrators. She remained at UW-Madison until she graduated in 2007, despite having to see one of her perpetrators on campus.“I stuck by what I deserved,” Dunn said. “And that was an education free from hostility.”‘No one should have that experience while in college’On July 13, 2005, Laura Dunn sat in her summer class and listened to her professor discuss rape in terms of genocide. The professor mentioned how sexual assault also happens on college campuses, and how the Dean of Students’ office had a special obligation to handle assault cases.Immediately after learning about this in her class, Dunn reported her assault to the Dean of Students’ office, approximately 15 months after her incident.Sexual assault is the most underreported crime, with more than 90 percent of sexual assaults on college campuses not reported to police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.Reporting has its consequences, Dunn said, noting how her “internal” stress turned “active” after reciting her story to investigators numerous times, as well as having to provide friends’ phone numbers for interviews.“It definitely shook me,” Dunn said. “Those two years of my college experience was dealing with the stress of a sexual assault, which is unfortunate. No one should have that experience while in college.”Dunn experienced years in which she thought there was “no hope” when all of her attempts to obtain justice over her perpetrators failed.“There was obviously years where I felt nothing good was going to come of this,” she said.But when a journalist from the Center of Public Integrity, who was investigating Title IX complaints regarding the way universities were handling sexual assaults, contacted Dunn for an interview her luck in obtaining justice began to change.“All this tragedy, all this failure, all this time and waste of my energy, actually turned into this story,” Dunn said. “All of the horror turned into something that is very powerful, and I do believe it directly contributed to the Title IX guidelines that came out in 2011.”The second part of this series will run April 11, which will detail Dunn’s fight for justice and her advocacy for the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act, signed into law March 7.",From victim to advocate: One sexual assault survivor shares her story,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/03/column-steubenville-case-exposes-worst-in-athletes-arrogance,"March 17, 2013 | 10:41pm CDT","The Steubenville rape trial, and Sunday’s verdict, has shed some light on the out-of-control direction which athletics in this country seem to be heading.The conviction and sentencing of Trent Mays and Ma’lik Richmond is just another in a line of high-profile cases involving the sexual assault of a woman by athletes.It continues to confuse me why athletes think they can commit these acts and get away with them. Is it just because they are athletes? Do they believe themselves above the law?While I have failed to discover the underlying reason as to why athletes view themselves where they can do no harm, we as a society have empowered them to do so.A 2003 USA Today article reported there was a 32 percent conviction rate of resolved sexual assault cases involving an athlete. I understand this statistic may be misleading. Some of those cases may have been false accusations or had an extreme lack of evidence, things that happen often. However, this is still a shockingly low percentage.If an athlete takes a look at this number, they may start to think there is such a small chance of being convicted and there is nothing to worry about. And that is a problem.Following Sunday’s verdict, Yahoo! Sports reporter Dan Wetzel wrote of the Steubenville case, “Put in the spotlight was the local football team, which, critics said, allowed players to brazenly operate seemingly above the law for years. Social-media accounts, self-made videos, photos and classless text messages exposed an entire world that seemed like a Hollywood script of a high school team out of control.”Wetzel’s words here strike at the very issue with sports culture in the United States. He wrote of the arrogance of athletes, in this case on the part of Mays, Richmond and everyone who turned a blind eye that night.I couldn’t agree more.The details of the case are horrifying. There are accounts of people failing to assist the victim prior to and during the crime. One friend of Mays and Richmond even testified saying he walked in on the act but did nothing about it, he just left.I am appalled at the level of indecency among these young men, young men who are so idolized by locals to the point where many adults even supply the indecency in the form of alcohol.Our society and everyone in it, including you and me, are to blame for what happened to the victim that night. Not only has her life been destroyed in a way I could never imagine, two other people’s lives will never be the same again.The Steubenville case is one the authorities handled perfectly and got right. However, there are countless similar cases every year that go unreported. Even of those that do get reported, two-thirds do not lead to convictions.Society has allowed athletes to develop a mindset of superiority, making them believe they are above the law. As we saw in the Steubenville case, this leads to an unmatched arrogance and sadly, one more young woman has become a victim because of that.What do you think about athletes and thier supposed arrogance?

This often happens when there is a problem that we as a society don’t really understand. Mix that in with the puzzling messages the media sends, and one can see how the crime of stalking is often misunderstood.Under Wisconsin state law, stalking is committed when one intentionally engages in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that causes emotional distress, fear of bodily injury or death. Examples of stalking behaviors include unwanted phone calls, text messages, threats, sending gifts and even physical abuse or murder.Unfortunately, stalking is still not widely recognized as a dangerous crime. Although there are many different factors, the media often contributes to this concern by trivializing stalking.The media tends to portray stalking as romantic or comedic rather than traumatizing and potentially lethal. Advertisements, songs, movies and television shows teach that if you stalk someone long enough it proves your love, and eventually they will fall in love with you too.Additionally, the media send out so many messages that stalking is a way to express love, that we don’t often see the harmful behavior to begin with.Take for example the popular book series, soon to be turned into a movie franchise, “Fifty Shades of Grey.” “Fifty Shades of Grey” features the relationship between Christian Grey and Anastasia “Ana” Steele. Christian’s actions throughout the first book in the series exemplify intimate partner stalking.As previously stated, some examples of stalking are repeated and unwanted phone calls or text messages. In “Fifty Shades of Grey,”Christian tracks Ana down and gives her gifts such as a laptop and cellphone. Throughout the novel, Ana struggles with her feelings and even though she ultimately accepts Christian’s behavior, this does not make his behavior acceptable.According to the Stalking Resource Center, 3.4 million people over the age of 18 are stalked in the United States each year, with people age 18-24 experiencing stalking at the highest rates. While there is little data specific to Madison, it can be inferred that not only is stalking happening on this campus, but that it is a big problem that demands our attention.Additionally, because of how stalking is portrayed in the media, people often write stalking off as a crime perpetrated by a creepy stranger, one that peers into women’s windows in the middle of the night. While this form of stalking does happen and should be addressed, it is by no means the norm, especially on a college campus. Perpetuation of this stereotype makes it difficult for people to truly understand the issue and how to help a victim when one comes forth.The media’s lighthearted portrayal of stalking also implies that the crime is not as dangerous or prevalent as it is and thus stalking has become normalized and accepted behavior on college campuses.When the media creates images or situations that make light of stalking, we as a society become desensitized to the horror that stalking victims live with every day.There are ways pop culture can depict stalking so the message is not disrespectful and creates a conversation about the dangers of stalking. Stalking and other forms of violence can and should be discussed in pop culture, but it should be in a manner that is both healthy and productive.Even though most of us aren’t executives in the entertainment industry, there are still ways to help. PAVE challenges you to counteract these negative messages and speak out on behalf of survivors in our communities, especially starting right here on campus.If you believe you are being stalked, you can contact the UW Police Department at 608-264-COPS or the Domestic Abuse Intervention Service’s crisis line at 608-251-4445.

MPD had arrested 256 individuals by 4 p.m, compared to the 14 they arrested by the same time in 2011.Only 103 of the 398 total arrests were UW-Madison students, according to the report.Like other city officials in the past year, including MPD Chief Noble Wray in July, the report emphasized moving Mifflin away from its “singular and unabashed focus on alcohol.”The report called on support from city and university officials as well as student-led efforts to minimize the over-consumption of alcohol.“There is still more to be done to assure that the Mifflin Street Block Party as it has been known does not occur in the future,” the report said.","MPD releases cost, arrest details from 2012 Mifflin Street Block Party",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/02/asm-makes-changes-to-funding-bylaws,"February 21, 2013 | 1:54am CST","The Associated Students of Madison Student Council passed an amendment to its bylaws Wednesday to clarify the definition of Viewpoint Neutrality, which is used in all of the organization’s funding decisions.The ASM bylaws state all funding decisions must be made in a viewpoint neutral manner, meaning student representatives may not take the mission of the group under consideration for funding into account when voting on budgets or grants.Previously, the bylaw included a clause that states a violation of procedure is considered a viewpoint neutrality violation. However, this was not part of the original definition as set in University of Wisconsin System Board of Regents v. Southworth, a 2000 court case over the use of student segregated fees to fund political or ideological campus organizations.According to SSFC Chair Ellie Bruecker, University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor David Ward mandated the bylaw change in an April statement regarding the alleged viewpoint neutrality violation by SSFC last year.“I’m happy that the change puts us in compliance with legal precedent, and I think that’s where we should always be,” Bruecker said.Representatives of the Event Alcohol Sales and Service Task Force also spoke in front of council Wednesday concerning recommended changes to alcohol-related policies at campus events.The task force was formed in response to the sexual assault controversy during the 2012 Rose Bowl, when John Chadima, former associate athletic director, allegedly put his hands down a male student employee’s pants against the student’s will, according to the victim.The task force consists of faculty, staff and students, including Dean of Students Lori Berquam, Director of University Health Services Sarah Van Orman and ASM Vice Chair Maria Giannopolous, who reported the committee’s proposed recommendations to council.The recommendations included setting a threshold of two-thirds of attendees at an event being 21 or older in order for alcohol to be permitted, as well as the strengthening of the alcohol beverage service permit process. The committee also made recommendations to ensure more strict enforcement of the minimum legal drinking age at events.The task force will give its recommendations to university administration in the coming months for approval and implementation.",ASM makes changes to funding bylaws,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/02/letter-stalking-awareness-and-support-needed-on-uw-madison-campus,"February 14, 2013 | 7:40pm CST","“Alex and Sam, both sophomores at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, previously dated for about a year. Despite their break-up, a couple of weeks ago Sam started closely following Alex’s whereabouts on Facebook and began showing up at places Alex went.At first, Alex felt like it was a weird coincidence. However, when Sam repeatedly began showing up at places, such as Alex’s work and favorite coffee shop, Alex began to feel uneasy. Sam’s behavior started to seem less and less coincidental.”This situation might be seen as trivial, but the type of behavior Sam is exhibiting constitutes stalking. Under Wisconsin state law, stalking is committed when one person intentionally engages in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that causes emotional distress, fear of bodily injury or death.Other examples of stalking behaviors include unwanted phone calls, text messages, threats, sending gifts and even physical abuse or murder.Each year, 3.4 million people are stalked in the United States (U.S. Department of Justice, 2009). Despite what is commonly portrayed in the media, 3 of 4 stalking victims are stalked by someone they know (Baum, et al “Stalking Victimization in the United States, access through “Stalking Fact Sheet,” Office on Violence Against Women, U.S. Dept. of Justice, June 2009).Stalking can have serious emotional consequences for victims. Forty six percent of stalking victims fear not knowing what will happen next (Eric Blauuw et al., “The Toll of Stalking,” Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 17, no. 1 (2002): 50-63.). Victims may feel debilitating anxiety and emotional turmoil stalking can cause, especially in the lives of students who are trying to balance so much. Imagine trying to balance school, work, a social life and even more while feeling the constant fear of your perpetrator.Unfortunately, most victims do not report the stalking to law enforcement, especially on college campuses. In a year-long study of 223 colleges done in 2000, over 83 percent of stalking incidents were not reported to police or campus law enforcement (U.S. Department of Justice, 2000). This statistic may cause people to question why so many stalking victims choose not to report. It may also provoke harmful attitudes such as: “That’s not really stalking. If that person was really being stalked, wouldn’t they report?” or “If stalking causes such psychological harm, why doesn’t the survivor report?” Failure to understand reasons for not reporting may contribute to the denial and minimization of victims’ experiences of stalking.There are several barriers that may prevent victims from reporting the stalking to law enforcement. Victims may feel as though stalking is not a serious crime, or fear that law enforcement would not take them seriously. Victims may think they lack sufficient evidence or fear retaliation by the stalker. They may also feel remorse for the stalker if he or she is an acquaintance, a former intimate partner or someone with whom the survivor is currently involved.There are also increased barriers to reporting in the cases of same-sex stalking. For example, the perpetrator may threaten to “out” the victim if they are not out publicly.Throughout the month of February, Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment (PAVE), a student organization on campus, will be recognizing Stalking Awareness Month (StAM). Although StAM technically takes place in January, PAVE will be hosting events recognizing it in February due to the timing of winter break.The National Center for Victims of Crime launched National Stalking Awareness Month in January 2004 in hopes of increasing the public’s understanding of the crime of stalking. StAM is a nationally recognized time of both observance and action. PAVE is taking a stand for the University of Wisconsin-Madison by creating awareness about stalking. PAVE also encourages the entire campus to get involved by learning more about stalking and creating an environment in which it is not tolerated.For more information on stalking and how you can get involved with StAM, visit the National Stalking Awareness Month website at stalkingawarenessmonth.org. Visit PAVE at office 3147 in the Student Activity Center.If you believe you are being stalked, you can contact the UW Police Department at 608-264-COPS or the Domestic Abuse Intervention Service’s crisis line at 608-251-4445.PAVE is a student organization dedicated to preventing sexual assault, dating/domestic violence and stalking on the UW-Madison campus through education and activism.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/01/beef-its-whats-for-twitter,"January 29, 2013 | 11:40pm CST","I’m a proud carnivore: the beef is served on my dinner plate. Slabs of tenderness, doused in grease and love with some sort of potato-based side dish; perhaps a cola, if you will. So pardon my disappointment… but I feel like there’s a shortage of beef in hip-hop right now. We’re getting a little too used to the cloned meat we taste through subliminals in songs. The hors d’oeuvres we scrape up from an empty shot on Twitter or someone straight flexin’ on Instagram leaves me, to simplify, empty.I’m in a room full of vegans with a carnivore mindstate. This is what hip-hop has become.For a little context, allow me to redefine “beef”: Beef is a staple in the diet of a culture that has spent decades in overdrive, with masculinity, sexuality, pride, greed and broken relationships at the core. Beef is saying someone’s name in a song when everyone’s waiting for it. Beef is a wordsmith being thrust forth into the coliseum where we are the bloodthirsty spectators, lusting with every piece of audio. Beef is about respect, and how it’s earned and kept. Beef transcends art and thrives in life. It is an essential, unavoidable chess piece in the human identity that we all confront one way or another.And then the thuggery went digital. And now, we have nothing left to whet our appetites.Obviously, I’m not expecting  lives to be lost over rap songs. That is a nonsensical and fairly stereotypical request. But Jesus Actual Christ, we are in crisis mode with an impending epidemic on the horizon: the ability to hide behind characters. Why waste four minutes when you have two or so sentences to talk down on someone? The soapbox provided via radio and television still exists, but very rarely will anyone step to the plate. When someone does, it is a barrage of empty threats, followed by another two sentences and a marketing plan for a VH1 show since everyone has one (connect the dots on who I’m talking about. Or turn the television on).The proliferation of social media has enabled our favorite talking pieces to build a collective force field around them to avoid the beef coming to them. Diss songs are never direct anymore; the fat and protein we receive from someone serving an aggravated assault on an enemy’s character is now shrouded in secrecy and code. We no longer go to wax… we go to the timeline.The examples are piling up by the minute. Recently, R&B crooners Chris Brown and Frank Ocean allegedly had a confrontation outside of a studio in L.A. over a parking spot. Nah. It was definitely the Twitter feud we saw last year. An ongoing Philadelphia rivalry between renowned battle-rapper/“My Drink N’ My 2 Step” artist Cassidy and MMG workhorse Meek Mill took several open shots in the realm of the light-blue bird before they exchanged diss tracks. The saddening (not really) breakup of the Money Team saw a twitter beef between loudmouth boxing champ Floyd Mayweather and G-turned-Vitamin-Water-slinger 50 Cent before a $5 million offer to box each other eventually surfaced (the details are still being hashed out. On Twitter. Go figure).Now something deserving of its own paragraph is the cardinal example of MMG bawse Rick Ross’s cocaine kingpin façade finally meeting him with death threats, cancelled tours and bullets. Apparently, he is currently engaged in a feud with the legendary Chicago-based Gangster Disciples over his symbolic disrespect of their major figurehead Larry Hoover on his smash hit “BMF (Blowin’ Money Fast)” as well as his claiming of GDs’ symbol on a recent mixtape and plenty more we have absolutely no idea about.Remember the 90s when gangsters didn’t own computers? Now they come equipped. The GDs have made multiple death threat videos banning Ross and his MMG cohort from entering Chicago until he handles whatever business is left. Even Cassidy was in one of them. Intersectionality, folks.A question for the new generation of hip-hop consumers: When is the last time you heard a decent diss record from your favorite artist? When was the last time a feud of WWE-esque proportions excited you to the point of watching every footprint for the next line? Do we even have towns, cities, high schools, or entire coasts taking sides anymore? No. A threshold for mediocrity in hip-hop has ushered in a new era of bland, diluted material for storylines to build foundations upon. We don’t take it to the streets; we take it to the tweets (Christ, that was corny). This beef is no longer grass-fed, free-range or any other hipster foodie term most rappers don’t use; it is grocery-grade chuck, longing for a purpose… and a middle finger. And we sit, logged in, waiting for the flame to return.Column over. Time for me to subtweet about yet another rapper I don’t respect. Now, is that boredom… or zeitgeist fuel? I’ll let the Internet Gangsters decide.Got a beef of your own? E-mail Michael at mdpenn@wisc.edu",Beef: it’s what’s for Twitter,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/01/column-armstrongs-ped-use-not-as-heinous-as-we-think-it-is,"January 27, 2013 | 11:10pm CST","In the world of professional sports, there will always be those stories that inspire and those stories that destroy a perception of who you thought someone was.Well, as luck would have it, there have been a few of those in the news recently and while reading about them and listening to what people had to say, I started to think about what we as a society care about.It was nearly impossible for someone to turn on the news or surf the Internet over the past few weeks and not hear about Lance Armstrong, Manti Te’o and Ray Lewis. We all know the stories. Armstrong doped and lied about it, Te’o’s girlfriend was faked and it appears he was duped, and Lewis is playing in the Super Bowl in what is his final season in the NFL.These stories turned us against a legend, created empathy for a college star and inspired countless people to never give up.I am going to say it right now: I am a huge fan of Armstrong. I always have been and I always will be. Now, don’t get me wrong, I do not support the fact that he sued countless people who did not deserve it. However, as a cyclist, no one compares to Armstrong, and I don’t think anyone will ever be able to.This has probably been one of the biggest stories in the world of sports recently, and even Oprah got involved. But I don’t see what the big deal is.So what if he took some banned substances?Even though taking these banned substances is prohibited by cycling’s governing boards, the act itself is not actually a crime. Setting aside falsely suing numerous people and lying in court, Armstrong’s use of these drugs was by no means illegal, but the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) now wants to ban him for life from competition.There are many cases of athletes committing, or allegedly committing, actual crimes but yet still compete. Take Lewis, for example. He was once involved in an incident where two men were stabbed to death. But he is an inspiration.Kobe Bryant was involved in an incident where it remains unclear whether or not he sexually assaulted a girl. But he changed his number and won an NBA championship.A female Saint Mary's student committed suicide days after accusing a Notre Dame football player of sexual assault, though no charges were ever filed. But Manti Te’o’s dead girlfriend never existed, so we all have to feel sorry for him.Our society doesn’t care about what is right and what is wrong. We want inspirational athletes, we want championships and we want to take down whoever sits at the top. The world of sports today is breeding a society that forgives and forgets too easily, a society that dwells on the unimportant and fails to care about those who really have been victimized.I would be lying if I said I do not believe Armstrong took banned substances. That has pretty much been established. However, he still maintains he never doped during the Tour de France and that he did not force his teammates to. For the time being, I can believe this. The top finishers are tested almost daily while the race is happening, and an operation to the degree the USADA accuses Armstrong of running would have taken the support of many other people.So what that he doped? Cycling is known to be the dirtiest sport in the world in terms of performance-enhancing drugs. In order to stay competitive, athletes almost have to use them at some point.The USADA has stripped Armstrong of his seven Tour de France wins. So then, who will the winner be? The runner-up? He was doping. Third place? Dirty. So now we are off the podium. Well, I suppose the fourth-place finisher could claim the victory. Nope? Oh, he tested positive. See where I’m going here?Those seven years will now have no recorded winner. Seven years of the Tour de France basically nullified because Armstrong was stripped, and it is nearly impossible to find a clean rider to give the title to.I just cannot understand why the American public crucified Armstrong for doing something that is common-place in cycling when other, more egregious incidents have taken place but no one seems to remember or care about them.Bryant will always stand as a champion, Lewis will continue to inspire, and Te’o will always be the one who got fooled, but Armstrong is now the villain: Few will remember him as the greatest cyclist who ever lived.That is what our society wanted, and that's what it got.Editor's Note: The original version of this column stated the girl committing suicide was a Notre Dame student and implied a group players had been found guilty for sexual assault. The allegation was against a single member of the football team, who was not charged by police.",Column: Armstrong's PED use not as heinous as we think it is,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/12/top-ten-news-fall-2014,"December 11, 2014 | 5:00am CST","The following are the Top Ten news stories we covered over the summer and in Fall 2014.1. Same-sex marriage ban overturnedA federal court struck down Wisconsin’s long-standing ban on same-sex marriage in September, reaffirming a June decision in a lower court that allowed the first same-sex couples to marry in Wisconsin.Reagan-appointed Judge Richard Posner wrote the biting decision.“Because homosexuality is not a voluntary condition and homosexuals are among the most stigmatized, misunderstood, and discriminated-against minorities in the history of the world, the disparagement of their sexual orientation, implicit in the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples, is a source of continuing pain to the homosexual community,” Posner wrote.State Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. The High Court also declined appeals from Utah, Oklahoma, Indiana and Virginia, allowing same-sex marriages to continue in those states as well.Gov. Scott Walker ceded the legal battle in October and ordered the state to recognize past and present same-sex marriage.-Andrew Hahn2. Gov. Scott Walker defeats Mary Burke in gubernatorial electionIn what some thought might be the closest gubernatorial election in Wisconsin’s history, Gov. Scott Walker beat Democrat Mary Burke, securing his third victory in four years.The former Trek Bicycle executive and Madison school board member was almost unheard of in the early days of her campaign. In Marquette University Law School Polls, the two candidates were consistently even until Walker pulled away by a few points within days of the election.Endorsements from President Barack and First Lady Michelle Obama fell short of motivating Democrats to get to the polls.Walker’s victory speech emphasized a sharp dichotomy between Washington and Wisconsin politics. According to UW-Madison political science professor David Canon, Walker has now solidified his position in Wisconsin politics and has also established himself among the GOP national base.“I think [a large margin of victory] raises his stock in the presidential sweepstakes,” Canon said. “[But] there is still a long way to go before he is one of the top contenders on the Republican side.”-Eoin Cottrell3. Michael Brown, Eric Garner killed by police officersWhite police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in August, gaining national attention and sparking debates over institutional racial disparities and police officers’ use of force.In November, a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson, so the case would not be brought to trial.The decision spurred nationwide protests and demonstrations, some of which turned violent.In Madison, students held a silent vigil outside a Badger basketball game to bring UW-Madison together over concerns of human rights.Students and community members also responded with a march ending at a police station, where protesters held “Black Lives Matter” banners and spoke against police brutality.Issues from the Ferguson case were echoed in New York, where another grand jury decided not to bring charges against a white police officer who killed Eric Garner, a black man, after putting him in a chokehold.-Bri Maas4. U.S. Supreme Court freezes voter ID law in WisconsinThe U.S. Supreme Court acted in October to halt Wisconsin’s voter ID law, weeks before the Nov. 4 elections.The law could have prevented students without proper identification, such as a passport, driver’s license or social security card, from voting in the elections, including the gubernatorial race between incumbent Gov. Scott Walker and challenger Mary Burke.UW-Madison took measures to provide students with proper identification by printing student IDs acceptable for voting. These were made available 52 days before the elections.Opinions differed on what the ultimate effect of the new law would have been.While Government Accountability Board Director Kevin Kennedy said he did not anticipate it would have an effect on voter turnout, American Civil Liberties Union member Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, said in a statement the order against the law removed hindrances to the voting process.-Dana Kampa5. ASM funds campus Food PantryThe Associated Students of Madison approved an allotment of funds in its 2015-’16 internal budget to create a food pantry on campus.The initiative, introduced by ASM Chair Genevieve Carter and Vice Chair Derek Field, will aim to provide a consistent food source for food-insecure students on campus.Student Council finalized a segregated fee allotment Dec. 3 of $3,000 in operating expenses, as well as $19,115.20 total salary allotment for the pantry’s two proposed employees.The planning and organizing stages for the pantry are slated to begin July 2015, with an anticipated opening next August, according to Carter. “It is a big undertaking especially because we really want to make sure that something like this is effective and is serving students who need it as well as we possibly can,” Carter said.-Emily Gerber6. UWPD joins national effort against sexual assault The University of Wisconsin Police Department joined the White House this semester in a movement to inform the public about the truth of sexual assault on college campuses.President Barack Obama’s “It’s On Us” campaign aims to reject the tolerance of sexual assault and change the shameful stigma it evokes.“We still don’t condemn sexual assault as loudly as we should,” Obama said in a speech at the Sept. 19 launch. “The message that sends can have a chilling effect.”UWPD joined the cause with its own “Tell Us” campaign, reaching out to victims with details about the process of reporting an assault.Semester-long efforts aimed to create environments intolerant of sexual assault and supportive of its victims.“Though crime in the city of Madison pales in comparison to others like Chicago, Milwaukee, or Boston, we certainly have our fair share of incidents,” a UWPD press release said.-Laura Grulke7. Madison and Dane County enforcement agencies crack down on drugsThe Dane County Narcotics Task Force has taken strides in cutting heroin out of the county, working alongside the Madison Police Department, which has taken steps to prohibit synthetic marijuana in Madison.Lt. Jason Freedman of the Dane County Narcotics Task Force said cracking down on heroin dealers has become a priority due to the 50 percent increase in heroin-related deaths since 2012. The Drug Enforcement Agency has worked with the task force to track dealers.Freedman said the task force has successfully tracked dealers making $10,000 to $50,000 worth of profits from heroin and plan to continue fighting the heroin epidemic.Madison police have also worked alongside city officials to pass an ordinance that would prohibit synthetic cannabinoids, or leaves resembling marijuana soaked in an acetone-based chemical.“People are going to be making financial decisions and say [the charges] are probably not worth that small financial gain,” MPD Capt. Brian Ackeret said about Madison dealers.-Patricia Johnson8. City budget impacts future city entertainment, council structureAn approved $5,000 for Revelry funding in Madison’s 2015 Operating Budget is expected to help the event gain more popularity, according to Ald. Mike Verveer, District 4, while the future of alder salaries will be an ongoing debate.“I think that as more and more students support [Revelry], this is a stand-alone event that has some real merit to it,” Madison Police Department Chief Michael Koval said in a November Board of Estimates meeting.While no date for Revelry has been set, Wisconsin Union President Sarah Bergman expects city monetary support to make the event “more sustainable.”Although a $4,400 per year raise for council members was approved at a November Common Council meeting, propositions to make alder positions a full-time job are more contentious, according to Ald. Chris Schmidt, District 11.“I think we need much more engagement and much more involvement in the process,” Schmidt said.-Irene Burski9. UW-Madison ushers in new provostAs the new school year began this fall, Sarah Mangelsdorf took her new position as provost at UW-Madison.With the University of Illinois, University of Michigan and Northwestern University checked off her list of previous employment, Mangelsdorf became the provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs.Mangelsdorf replaced Paul DeLuca Jr., who ended his term after five years of work on campus.Mangelsdorf’s roles include managing university curriculum, enrollment, diversity initiatives and staff programs.“She is viewed as a collaborative trust-builder, who is loved and respected by students, faculty and staff,” Chancellor Rebecca Blank said in an April 10 release. She added Mangelsdorf is also recognized for her work on “key” initiatives, including diversity and faculty retention.-Ellie Herman10. Tiki Shack faces struggles during rebranding phaseUnderage patrons and management legal troubles have plagued Tiki Shack, the Caribbean-themed restaurant on State Street, since the current owner decided to transfer ownership to two managers earlier this year.Joseph Vale, the current owner, announced plans to transfer management of the bar, located at 128 State St., to Caleb Percevecz and Daniel Mijal, who would convert the establishment into a restaurant with island-themed cuisine.However, in October, Percevecz was arrested after punching an 18-year-old man and chipping his tooth. Percevecz has pending charges of disorderly conduct and substantial battery.Later in November, the bar came under fire again after a fight broke out between two underage patrons. Members of the Alcohol License Review Committee were “troubled” by the fact that the 15-year-old and 19-year-old were in the bar, let alone that a fight broke out.Percevecz and Mijal are awaiting feedback from a proposal for a new liquor license from ALRC.-Sam Cusick",Top Ten News Fall 2014,UWM

There was also debate over a line item requesting airfare for members to attend various conferences.Secretary Brett DuCharme pointed out that MEChA looked to send far more people than other student organizations and felt it would only be fair to adjust MEChA’s budget appropriately.Both the music equipment and airfare items were lowered and the final budget was approved at $91,977.96.Veterans, Educators, and Traditional Students also presented a budget request to committee members for 2015-’16.VETS aims to assist students and improve their learning by providing exposure to veterans with a variety of first-hand military experiences.

They provide workshops and events including Domestic Violence Awareness Month in October.PAVE requested a $947.11 increase from the current budget of $81,343.31. PAVE representatives proposed increasing funding for ongoing campus awareness because they project larger campus interest in sexual assault prevention.While the committee questioned the low attendance of past events, PAVE Chair Hannah Serwe said she believes there will be an increase in attendance because of the It’s On Us campaign through the White House and the increased media coverage.“Not a lot of people want to go to an event where they are going to hear about crimes that are being committed in their area, but it is really important that we hold the events,” Serwe said. “I don’t believe that small turnout necessarily means a failed event.”Serwe said PAVE noticed an increase in people who want to get involved within the first months of school. In its Wisconsin Welcome Week event, 200 students attended.SSFC representatives also asked about the funds for Social Work 672, a service learning course where students learn about different forms of sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking.SSFC will make a budget decision Thursday.",PAVE requests higher budget for 2015-’16,UWM

The events were inspired by Columbia University student Emma Sulkowicz, who resolved to carry her dorm mattress around campus until the school expels her rapist.“This is to show our solidarity with rape victims on campus,” Healy said. “There is a culture here that means that we don’t talk about [rape and sexual assault], and there is a lot of mishandling by the UW administration. We want to call attention to these things.”Healy pointed to the lack of administrative response after one of her friends was sexually assaulted as an example of what she considers to be weak university policies.“After my friend reported the assault, they came back to her and said that the perpetrator seemed really sorry and that they wouldn’t pursue [investigating] it,” she said.UW Extension employee and 2012 alumna Lydia Roussos, one of the roughly 50 protesters, also criticized the administration.“It is important that the administration know that the way they take care of issues involving sexual assault is unacceptable,” Roussos said. “They want to brush victims of sexual assault under the rug for appearance and business reasons.”2012 alumnus Brandon Clementi, also a UW Extension employee, said he sees the issue as important for both sexes.“If only women stood up for equality, that wouldn’t accomplish anything,” Clementi said. “This is an issue that affects everyone, not just women, and should be supported by everyone.”Director of University of Health Services Sarah Van Orman said in a phone interview she supports the protesters but defends the university’s strategies to combat sexual assault.“I am supportive of the continued awareness of rape and sexual assault and am happy to discuss the work done here on campus,” Van Orman said. “We are committed to meeting the needs of survivors, holding perpetrators accountable and hearing from students about what we can do better.”",Students organize to protest sexual assault policy,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/slug-chats-freakfest-and-appropriation,"October 30, 2014 | 1:00am CDT","Slug, born Sean Daley, is 42 and having some of the best years of his life. He is hailed as a God MC to so many children of the Midwest Winter.This is my testimony: I hailed him so at the tender age of 13, in a Maryland winter far less furious, where I found no other kids who dive-bombed into the Rhymesayers catalog like I did.I spoke of Atmosphere in several ways as a youth. I spoke aimlessly, not knowing that Slug and Anthony “Ant” Davis were a team for a very long time. I spoke ignorantly, as my racial awareness had yet to be cultivated; I assumed Slug was only a white man. But most of all, I spoke proudly in defense of my prepubescent backpack lean that privileged You Can’t Imagine How Much Fun We’re Having over the earlier work of Atlanta (trap) God MCs Gucci Mane and Waka Flocka Flame.I idolized Slug’s narratives. I fawned over how Ant’s beats didn’t sound like the three hip-hop stations always on in my mother’s blue Honda Accord. My first concert was on the 9:30 Club D.C. stop of the “When Life Gives You Lemons Tour,” where I left a demo with my bald face in a God Loves Ugly cover generator outside of the tour bus in the rain. I MySpaced the group page afterward; they didn’t find it, but gave me an address to send it to. I never did.My first rap releases sounded like carbon copies of Slug. Thus, when he tweeted some of my most successful musical efforts this past winter, the nostalgia smacked me with a wave of satisfaction that my shots in the dark were noticed by a man whose CDs remain on my dresser at home. I reminisced over my friends jabbing at me in ninth grade about how I would one day get signed to Rhymesayers.Quite frankly, the embers of that dream still burn.I graduated high school, felt older than I was, and shed the backpacker for a balanced rap palette that allotted as much A$AP Mob as Atmosphere in my eardrums. But as confirmed by my pre-Freakfest phone chat with Daley, who will headline the Capitol Stage at midnight Nov. 1, growing and observing how hip-hop continues to evolve can do nothing but epitomize how one must learn that it is fine to be fine with everything.Michael Penn II: What type of live show are you gonna bring: band, DJ, both?Slug: Two DJs, Anthony and DJ Plain Ole Bill.MPII: Why the switch-up from the band? I know your live show has changed a lot over the years…S: When I started the band, it was because I wanted the ceiling to be higher, I wanted to learn more. I wasn’t scared anymore, man! I was getting on stage with the DJ and running through my set drunk with no problem, and so I knew it was time to scare myself again. When it was time to stop working with the band, it was time to push again. So we got the two DJs, and at the same time Anthony is also running a bunch of toys—effects, Ableton—we’re basically creating our tracks, but we’re running ’em through Ableton so we could separate the sounds like you would a band.My sound guy, he has access to all of the tracks. Oh, the hi-hats? Let’s see what happens when we get rid of the hi-hats. Oh, this [sound]? Let’s see what happens… I like to overstate it, cuz I’m a rapper and that’s what we do. We got a bunch of mad scientists all working on the show together. In my world, there’s more room for shit to go wrong, and that’s where the fear comes to play.That was the big part of having a band, because now we were dependent on four people to do their shit right. And if any one of them fucks up, it could fuck up all of us! And that was where the fear and the anxiety came in, and to me that’s an important part of the show. Now, not only can any one of us fuck it up, but technology problems could occur. To me: it’s the most fun I’ve had in a long time on stage. For the audience: eh, I don’t know if they really like it or not, not my problem.MPII: Have you ever been to Freakfest before? Do you know what to expect?S: Well, it’s Madison: they like to drink already. So imagine them turning it up to like, 15, and dressing up in costumes and shit. I kind of anticipate it to be a very inebriated mess, which, technically… when I perform shows, usually I’m the drunkest person in the room. I have a feeling that’s not going to be the case, so that takes a lot of pressure off of me! (Laughter) In fact, I might not even drink! I might just kick it sober!I’m not super worried about it, I’m not nervous; I think it’s gonna be a lot of fun. I’ve always been good at crowd control—not the kind that riot police do, but more like MC shit. Talking to the crowd, I know how to put smiles on people faces; I know how to get the audience to reflect what it is I’m feeling and vice-versa. Plus, I got a couple of homies that are playing too, and that’s just gonna magnify the whole situation.MPII: Think about the home-region advantage, too, because people are gonna be geeked as fuck. People might travel for that, because I don’t think you can get a ticket for an Atmosphere show that cheap anywhere else.S: That’s a good point… how much are the tickets?MPII: Eight dollars.S: Eight dollars?MPII: Eight bucks, yeah.S: What the fuck, that’s probably why the Chicago show is sellin’ so slow…MPII: … Maybe, cuz it’s just like—S: (Laughter) Chicago’s selling just fine, I’m just fuckin’ around!MPII: It’s probably gonna be a drunken mess. It used to be an understated thing where people would just come and be drunk as shit in the street, but the city didn’t have nothin’ to do with it. So it would cost them a fuckton of money. People would get sexually assaulted, fights, and a bunch of—S: Man, are you kiddin’ me? There’s shit on YouTube! They call it “Halloween Riots” and shit! Money got involved, people got involved like ‘Hey! If we do this right, we can make some money off of it and we can contain it and make it funner for people.’ But at the end of the day, I still anticipate nudity and vomit.MPII: And a little racism, here and there.S: A little racism here and there?MPII: I mean, costume-wise. I’ve seen people dressed up as prisoners, there’s a lot of Ray Rice shit going around now…S: Man, that’s fuckin’ unfortunate. So people are going straight up in blackface as Ray Rice type-shit?MPII: You get the occasional ‘I’m gonna wear a sombrero, and I’m like 1/10th Mexican, so it doesn’t matter.’ Shit like that.S: They call that appropriation nowadays, that’s the new word that’s been makin’ the blogs… It’s interesting man, I like how you threw in, since I’m a 1/10th Mexican, and since great-grandma was Latino, that’s okay for me to do this, because that is such a large part of white privilege that people don’t talk about.We’ve had a lot of conversations about white privilege over the last five years, and that’s good cuz we’re trying to open it up so that even those people who have benefits from white privilege can understand what’s going on. But one of the things that I think doesn’t get talked about is the privilege of also claiming ethnic privilege.For instance, I come from—let’s just keep it simple—a mixed-race background. But, I try to be careful how much I talk about that publicly because it sends the wrong message sometimes. It’s one of those things you gotta use and speak on at the right time. It’s not something that needs to be addressed unless I actually have a positive agenda for it; otherwise, it just seems like I’m tryna name-drop what kinda bloods I got in me! In hip-hop, that comes hand-in-hand with someone who appears to be trying to claim authenticity.I’m glad you brought it up, and I’m glad that it’s something that’s getting spoken on more and more, although it’s kinda odd it got brought up talking about Freakfest, but whatever the doorway we gotta use, let’s use it.MPII: You just made me jump like seven questions down. I didn’t think you were gonna bring it up, because you never bring it up, but since you brought it up… you know what climate we’re in with police and black and brown people. What have your interactions been like with police? Have they differed from you benefitting from white privilege? People that interact with you… can they tell you’re a mixed man, has that affected police interactions? Or is it just a face value thing?S: It’s interesting, a lot of it is a face value thing, but it also depends on how you dress. When I was younger, up until my last year in high school, I had very long hair. I used to wear it in a ponytail most of the time. There was no benefit at that point because most people that saw me presumed I was Native American. Even as far as the long-hair white boy point, I didn’t wear my hair like them; I wore it in a ponytail, very well-kept, and I wore a jean jacket. And so motherfuckers always used to assume I was Native. When I was a kid, I used to get fucked with by the cops a lot more. Then when I cut my hair… I didn’t get fucked with unless I deserved to get fucked with, if that makes any sense. I wasn’t gettin’ stopped and fucked with for no reason—it was only when I actually kinda had it comin’.That was a major change that I saw, which was interesting because I grew my hair out again as an older man… shit, like, 2008, I was rockin’ the ponytail again, I had grown it out. And at that point, I was a grown-ass man, and so… I dare you to fuckin’ profile me now! I am a mouthpiece! It’s 2008: I was on top of the world as far as underground rap went, I will use the situation and make a song about it! And nothing ever happened of course, cuz that’s how nature works.But I tell you what, when I had a Mohawk… shit was weird. I was a grown-ass man with a Mohawk and I was only doing it because a) it was funny, b) I actually had a condition going on for about a year called alopecia, where I was losing my hair. A Mohawk was the only thing I could grow that looked okay. So I was like, well fuck it, I’ve never had a Mohawk, I’ll do it. And that year man… I was fucked with by cops, I had old women scared of me, and it was funny because it wasn’t just white women… it was all old women!But the interesting thing about that is that’s a lifestyle choice, you chose to wear your hair like that. So, if people react, you can’t really be like ‘Why are you reacting to me?!?’ That’d be like you reacting to me if I was walking around with a, uh… holding on to a dead bird. And I’m not comparing people’s Mohawks to people who walk around carrying dead birds, but I’m just trying to come up with some kind of example. But you’re not used to seeing a guy with a Mohawk, especially my age, so yes, you’re nervous to stand behind me in line at Walgreens, I get it.Truth be told, man, I haven’t necessarily had to be too concerned about the police since I was a kid. There’s another side to that though: me and a lot of my friends haven’t put ourselves into positions or made lifestyle choices that would dictate us having to worry about cops anyway. I don’t go out. I’m not out there. If I get pulled over, it’s because I was doing something wrong, but I could be driving—I’m driving right now, down Lyndale Avenue—and if a cop pulled up next to me, he wouldn’t look at me twice. However, driving the truck I’m driving, if I was 22-years-old and black, hell yeah he’s gonna look at me! And he’s gonna be like ‘Who is this little motherfucker in this truck?’MPII: That might be one word he’d say, but… you know.S: Yeah yeah yeah, but that’s… the word that I’m gonna say!MPII: I feel like there’s always times and places where you elect to step in and commentate on certain things, given your perspective. Have you ever felt explicitly responsible as an artist to comment on anything in a political landscape?S: I did feel like that for a while, until I found myself in a forum where people didn’t know who I was and I still found out that I needed to be outspoken. I think that it’s got less to do with my music and more to do with my humanity and probably my upbringing. The music is good because it gives me a doorway to some ears who might not care what I got to say, but ultimately, even without the music, I probably would be a very opinionated dude trying to talk shit to people who would listen anyway. Especially when I look back on my youth, I was involved in a lot of youth groups even before I was really trying to be a rapper. Thanks to Uncle Chuck D and KRS, there was a push for us just to be conscious... as kids—I’m talking about, 15, 16-year-old kids—to be conscious and aware of what’s going on in our communities.There’s a couple of parks here in Minneapolis, Powderhorn and McRae, and we’d go kick it and there was always an older brother that would be there to talk to us and inform us of shit. And because of rap music, it made us open and eager to hear what these dues would have to say to us and apply it. Now, applying it back then meant going to school and talkin’ shit to other people, and standin’ for somethin’ or telling a white boy off or something! And as an adult, because got so involved in hip-hop that I forgot that, as a kid, we were already kind of on that. Sometimes I actually wonder if I’m active enough; with my voice and my status, for whatever it’s worth, why am I not more active?And I turn to some of my colleagues, and I talk about this kind of shit with [Brother] Ali or I Self [Divine] or some of the friends of mine that are even far more active than me, and they’re like ‘You know what? Don’t trip on yourself about it, because at the end of the day, you’re doing your best and you do have to balance everything. In order to have the voice you have, you have to maintain that voice; sometimes you gotta play the background, or sometimes you gotta play the foreground. This ain’t like you get to be wide receiver and that’s all you play; you gotta be ready to fill in any position that you can when called upon.MPII: I ask you that question in particular because there’s a Bossip video from the 2014 Bet Hip-Hop Awards Red Carpet where this reporter, who was asking really shitty questions in general, asked Young Thug a really oddly-framed question about Mike Brown and how black men are policed and he said: “Leave that up with the critics and the laws and all that other shit. We having fun, we iced out, we having money. That’s how we doing it.” Then she asked if it’s an artist’s job to respond to things like that and he was like “No.”S: I don’t think it’s an artist’s job to do that. The funny thing about art is that it requires an audience. So to me, I think it’s an artist’s job to emote or push whatever that artist is about, whatever that artist feels. I don’t want an artist who doesn’t have an opinion on something to give an opinion on something just for the sake of it.MPII: That’s exactly how I responded, but as a person of color, there’s that line that’s straddled whether or not there’s an inherent responsibility just because he’s black.S: That shit ain’t nothing new, though, man. Even during the Civil Rights movement, there was a lot of black artists who kept their mouths shut because they didn’t wanna fuck up their money. To be real, there’s a part of me that understands that because it’s one thing to be like ‘Yo, I’m puttin’ this down for us as a people!’ But there’s also this fear of: you could put it down all fuckin’ day long and it might not fuckin’ work. But if I can fuckin’ get at least me and my immediate surroundings up out this bitch, I gotta do whatever I gotta do to do that. I’m not gonna judge anybody, man. I’m not gonna judge Young Thug for not having an opinion.Now, don’t get me wrong: we can. We’re allowed to judge whoever the fuck we wanna judge. In the same breath, though: I don’t know what hood that dude’s from. Technically, some of these hoods are so fuckin’ bad that, first and foremost, you gotta worry about getting yourself and your siblings up out that bitch.MPII: The fuck up outta there, by any means.S: Yeah! And so in that regard, it’s a really hard one for me to judge, man. I can’t be that dude, and don’t get me wrong, I’ve been that dude in the past. The only reason I have the perspective I got now is probably cuz I’m old. But when I was younger, I was a lot more judgmental. You remember in the ’90s when we had to pick sides: do we wanna get jiggy wit’ it or do we wanna be conscious? Now, that I’m older, I realize that it’s all ok. Every side of it is okay. But to put him in the position of—MPII: “Black Person Spokesman.”S: Yes, exactly! That’s not okay, at least to me. There are people out there who take that role because they’re built for that role, and there are people out there who are not built for that role. Young Thug, as a “Black Person Spokesman”, is a story of a have-not becoming a have. And that goes a long way, in ways that sometimes we don’t necessarily wanna acknowledge. Instead, we wanna drag a motherfucker down and be like ‘Aye, he ain’t doing shit for the community!’ But the truth is… he is! Maybe he’s doing it accidentally, but he is because he is another have-not becoming a have, and employing other have-nots! He’s giving motherfuckers jobs! And that’s some shit that a lot of motherfuckin’ activists ain’t doin’!We gotta cut the bullshit, and really just take everything in for what it is. There’s duty to all of this, there’s value to all of this. It doesn’t have to be so fucking cut-and-dry or, for lack of better words, it doesn’t have to be black-and-white. You can actually figure out how to take any of this and apply it, especially in contemporary times. All of this shit’s important. Young Thug is not out here dancing a jig for the Republicans… that’s all that fuckin’ matters!MPII: But… you saw that video of Bobby Shmurda that came out in the last 24 hours, though?S: I did, and that motherfucker was trying to get a job! But trust me… Bobby Shmurda does not give a fuck about the GOP! He’s trying to get a job so that he can do what Young Thug is doin’. And I feel that. I’m not that. That’s not me. But I feel that.MPII: But I’m fucking scared for him. That dude’s younger than me; he’s a Crip from upstate New York. What the fuck? That’s a direct parallel from what you would show in a lecture unit about minstrelsy. He’s on the damn table, spinning around, like a new toy they’re trying to get to go against the phone next season. It’s fucking scary, what do we do?S: I don’t know, but he made that choice to do that, and the rest of us get to just watch and see how it play out. But I’m not gonna judge the dude for it, because you said the key words there: he’s younger than you. We’re talking about somebody whose decision-making and reasoning here is not wrong, not for his age. He wanna make it. Michael [Jackson] was doing that shit at 5! Are we gonna blame Michael? No, but we can blame his dad who was 30!He’s a kid, man, so I can’t be mad at a kid for thinkin’ he can dance his way out the hood. Especially considering the hood he comes from. In his reality, he thinks he either gotta get this or he gonna have to die or kill somebody. And I don’t mean to speak for him, obviously… I’m totally profiling this motherfucker right now, I don’t mean to.MPII: Go off what we have: “selling crack since like the 5th grade…”S: Going off what we got, I’m saying this: what he did in that video is more positive and progressive than some of his other options. And don’t get me wrong, I don’t cosign what he did because I’m too old to do some shit like that. I’ve seen and learned too many things. But I’m not gonna judge him for it, because I would have to put myself in his shoes to understand. And right now he’s gonna be the joke of the blog circuit, but it’s ok, it’s only gonna be for three days. That shit goes away after three days.MPII: If he goes away after three days, does he go back to the hood and die?S: Who knows? Maybe he will continue to escalate and make a name for himself. But that embarrassing moment that got caught on tape and put on the internet will only last for three days. Not only that, but thank God we got it out the way early. Cuz now, he can maintain a career for three years. At least this shit didn’t show up three years later. We got it out the way, right away. At least, for the sake of Bobby.Now he can learn from it, and a) either control his environment so that shit don’t get caught on tape ever again, or b) learn from it and go ‘You know what? I won’t never do no shit like that again.’ And at the end of the day, he’s a kid, man. We want these kids to be grown-ups.Because of your situation, and because of [you being 20] and how aware you are, it’s easy for you to look at Bobby and be like ‘What the fuck are you doin’, motherfucker?’ But I’m 42, so when I look at what Bobby’s doing, I’m like ‘Well, yeah, he’s a kid.’ What he know about coonin’? He’s a kid. He don’t know what he’s doing. I’m not gonna say he’s coonin’, I’m not gonna say none of that shit cuz he’s a kid! If he was 35—MPII: Then it’s obvious: get the fuck off the table, you dumbass.S: Exactly! But he’s a kid. I was 20 once… man, if at 20, if you’d have told me ‘these motherfuckers might give you a job,’ man I’d have jumped there and tried breakdancing. I promise you I would have… and I was kind of aware!

Eric Barron was president of Florida State University in 2012 when Jameis Winston, who would go on to win the Heisman, was accused of rape. The university and the Tallahassee Police Department failed to adequately investigate, sweeping the charges under the rug. The university’s failure is an apparent violation of federal law. And yet somehow, earlier this year, Mr. Barron was appointed president of Penn State University, a school infamous for the cover-ups of child sexual abuse in its football program.The news is filled with accusations of disturbing crimes at all levels of football—high school, college, and pro. Offenders must face prosecution. Unfortunately, it is too often the case that police, prosecutors, school administrators, coaches and parents are willing to overlook crimes. Take Ray Rice. He avoided three to five years in prison through a pretrial intervention program that was granted in less than 1 percent of domestic violence cases. And the NFL gave Rice only a two-game suspension until public outcry forced the league’s hand.Back to the case of Jameis Winston—the investigating police officer, who prosecutors blame for a series of mistakes, had a conflict of interest. An investigation by the New York Times found he had done private security work for the Seminole Boosters, the primary financial backer of Florida State athletics. The Seminole Boosters also paid a quarter of FSU president Eric Barron’s $602,000 salary.And sadly these cases extend down to the high school level. We have just recently learned of the sexual assault charges for seven upperclassman at Sayreville War Memorial High School. But what most outrages the parents of these children? The football season has been cancelled. Football’s troubles do not stem simply from the thugs who commit these crimes. Local school districts, the NCAA, and the NFL are all to blame. They have murky, arbitrary rules so that the system can be gamed to benefit the teams and the leagues. This extends below the criminal level. Bill Bellichick remains the Patriots’ head coach after a cheating scandal in which NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had the evidence destroyed. Jim Tressel was forced to resign as Ohio State’s coach because of his knowledge of a merchandise-for-tattoos scandal that he ignored. But Tressel, despite his lack of academic credentials, has now become Youngstown State University’s president, where he has authority over athletics.And now this week, the University of North Carolina has been caught in a long-running academic fraud scandal. The system is deeply flawed.And thus we come to the work of Jean Tirole, who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences last week. He is best known for his work on regulation, and our interest here is in the study of “regulatory capture,” where a regulator colludes its industry.  Despite their clear monopoly status, the NFL and NCAA face little oversight from government. Both self-regulate. The NCAA was created in response to regulatory concerns raised by Teddy Roosevelt. Schools likely prevented increased scrutiny by forming their own regulatory body. Should anyone be surprised that a system controlled by member schools or the NFL team owners fails to adequately police its league? A key lesson from Tirole is that each industry is fundamentally different, and its regulation must be handled in a way that prevents abuse but also allows the economic actors to succeed. Government should tread lightly. Too often, government will jump into the regulatory game and create impossibly complex rules in which punishments are negotiated, arbitrary, and lacking transparency. That would perpetuate the current system. Instead, rules must be concise and set clear standards for how problems should be addressed. It is little wonder that football seems out of control when those involved in the sport have been able to push the boundaries for so long. Hopefully football can be saved from its failed self-regulation.Tell us how you feel and please send  all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Letter To The Editor: Football continues to set poor example of moral character in society,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/cardinal-view-uwpd-misses-the-mark-on-crime,"October 12, 2014 | 11:25pm CDT","Last week, a list of safety tips originally entitled “Shedding the Victim Persona: Staying Safe on Campus” was published by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Police Department. The list swiftly attracted national attention after a front-page post on Jezebel, a blog-style website aimed at women’s interests, slammed UWPD for using victim-blaming language. Among pointers like “don’t travel alone,” “travel on well-lit paths,” “pre-plan” and “drink responsibly”—suggestions commonly featured in similar lists about campus safety—were more aggressively worded tips such as “If you present yourself as easy prey, then expect to attract some wolves;” “Be a hard target—a victim looks like a victim!” and “The right attitude is ‘I won’t let it happen to me!’” We believe the list of tips—which, following the backlash, now has a revised title, several statements removed, an editor’s note and a list of resources for victims—was compiled with good intentions. However, the police department was irresponsible for publishing tips that, in the eyes of many people both on- and off-campus, were worded in a way that bordered on victim-blaming. The latter statement regarding one’s attitudes, which is one of the original statements that was preserved in the edited version of the list, is especially disconcerting—no one lets themselves be robbed, raped or sexually assaulted. The department’s choice of wording was disappointing because it is an organization comprised of trained professionals who are expected to uphold a high standard of respect for victims and set a sterling example for the rest of the community. As campuses around the country deal with an epidemic of sexual assaults, we believe the department should have worded its suggestions in a more supportive manner and, in the wake of multiple sexual assaults in residence halls across the UW-Madison campus, should have provided students with a detailed list of what sexual assault is and how consent must be given. Sexual assault is not just sexual intercourse when one or more of the individuals involved is intoxicated and unable to give consent—it is also unwarranted grinding or dancing, lewd “jokes” and distributing sexually explicit photos or videos of an individual without their consent (“revenge porn”). It can be perpetrated by a stranger or by a victim’s close acquaintance. If UWPD is intent on reducing and eventually eliminating sexual assault on campus, they must accompany their list of tips for campus safety with education about the different types of sexual assault and how everyone on campus should confront and prevent them. Both the police department and members of the community must address the issue of sexual assault with the utmost seriousness and respect, or the epidemic of sexual assaults will persist and victims will continue to struggle for justice within an environment of shame and ignorance.What is your opinion on the UWPD’s published statement?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/looking-at-celebrities-nudes-is-callous,"October 7, 2014 | 11:20pm CDT","Today, Vanity Fair released an interview with Jennifer Lawrence where she spoke about the celebrity nude photo leak. This is the first time she has responded publicly to the situation involving an Internet hack that published revealing photos of her and hundreds of other female celebrities Aug. 31 of this year. The victims of the hack were all female with the exception of one male’s photos who were revealed just days ago in the fourth round of hacks. Lawrence spoke with Vanity Fair’s Sam Kashner where she said, “Just because I’m a public figure, just because I’m an actress, does not mean that I asked for this.” She went on to say, “It does not mean that it comes with the territory. It’s my body, and it should be my choice, and the fact that it is not my choice is absolutely disgusting. I can’t believe that we even live in that kind of world. ” A common critique of this entire situation has been “if you didn’t want anyone to see those pictures you shouldn’t have taken them in the first place.” I’m here to tell you that blaming the victims of this sexual violation (because that’s precisely what it is) is unequivocally callous. By that logic I should not have been enraged when my Internet password and credit card information was stolen and posted all over the Internet during the Heartbleed hack earlier this year, right?It is incredulous to me that as a society we are more willing to blame the victims of these hacks than we are to blame those who violate our privacy. If you go out and slunk around someone’s bedroom taking naked pictures of them, is it also that person’s fault for getting naked or is it the photographers fault for invading personal privacy? That answer should be self-explanatory. Let’s bring this scenario closer to home. If you took a revealing photo of yourself and left it in your home and a few weeks later you saw that photo floating around the Internet on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Imgur and Instagram being shared without your consent, are you going to blame yourself because someone else broke into your house? You shouldn’t. We’ve become too accustomed to blaming victims and just accepting the fact that our privacy ends where technology begins. This is not how we should react to situations such as these. There are certain levels of expectation regarding privacy and cyber security that should be no different. Lawrence called on lawmakers and society saying “The law needs to be changed, and we need to change.” This computer hack is a symptom of a larger problem in America and there is a necessity for us to change our behavior towards sexual offenses. You can no longer sit there and say “she should have known this would happen and never have taken those pictures in the first place.” This is no different than saying a woman dressed in a short skirt out late at night was “asking for it” when she was sexually assaulted while walking home. The default response to sexual offenses should never be to blame the victim. We’ve fallen back on this idea of “Don’t get sexually assaulted” rather than “Don’t sexually assault” and it’s about damn time we change that. We can’t go on perpetuating this trope of denying responsibility because that’s just the way it is. Lawrence has more advice for our conscious deprived society saying “That’s why these Web sites are responsible. Just the fact that somebody can be sexually exploited and violated, and the first thought that crosses somebody’s mind is to make a profit from it. It’s so beyond me. I just can’t imagine being that detached from humanity. I can’t imagine being that thoughtless and careless and so empty inside.” Now I’d like to talk to those of you out there who have looked at these actresses’ photos. You’re low. Really low. It doesn’t matter to me how you did it. Whether you saw your roommate looking and you leaned over to check it out or you willingly sought them out. These hundreds women did not consent to their photos being released to the public and you went ahead and violated their privacy just as the hacker(s) did. Lawrence said it best: “Anybody who looked at those pictures, you’re perpetuating a sexual offense. You should cower with shame.” I can’t say that I disagree with her.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/sexual-assault-legislation-may-not-lead-to-future-prevention,"October 6, 2014 | 12:28am CDT","The sexual assault epidemic occurring on college campuses across the nation is becoming a symbol of moral decline. As a response, many college campuses are adopting their  own unique campaigns in order to prevent further spreading of the violence. One notable example would be UW-Madison’s “Tonight” program, a mandatory online course about sexual assault for every freshman here on campus. This concern, however, is no longer an issue limited to college campuses alone. The state of California recently passed a law obligating that every college have a consent policy or else lose state financial aid. It seems the declining morality among college students expressed in the abuse of sexual desires is now a flaming issue thrown into legal jeopardy.It is not a surprise to see a state actually passing a law to require “affirmative consent” instead of just passive agreements before any sexual contact. Many universities and legal fields are increasingly putting more weight on handling this particular social issue. Many colleges already have their own affirmative consent policies and quite a number of others are following California in adopting similar policies. Unfortunately, even if the efforts are strong and actions are taken quickly, many campus safety experts argue that this concept is too new and too little studied to be seen as truly effective. The law requires students to have sexual consent through verbal communication or action before engaging in sexual activity. But the question is then raised about the methods of obtaining sexual consent because their variation. One form of consent that worked for one individual may not be accepted as valid consent for another. Although the intention of this law is undoubtedly good, it may not be able to escape from future conflicts in defining what exactly sexual consent is. Despite the potential confusion in framing the definition of sexual consent, I personally believe that this approach will prove effective. This law now jeopardizes the granting of federal financial aid to colleges based on their ability to adopt this new law, which is an essential need for colleges to maintain their academic legacies. However, this policy may not seem as effective as it appears to be. Unfortunately, it is somewhat  similar to alcohol abuse policies in colleges across the country. Even if colleges or states set strict laws for underage drinking, there are plenty of drunken students and plenty of drunken mistakes. The sexual assault law could unfortunately follow a similar pattern. Therefore, we may have to be aware of the fact that the legalization of sexual consent laws will not eradicate the attacks and horror completely.Based on a nationwide trend, there is little to no emphasis on male sexual harassment or  incidents of abuse. Our campus’s “Tonight” program, based on my memory, contained little information about sexually abusive situations for men. The anecdotes or people who were seen as preventive sources or others were  all portrayed by females. I am well aware of the fact  that sexual assault victims are overwhelmingly female, and this law includes the consent from both male and female parties. However, men are generally left significantly behind in awareness. Additionally, what about  same sex relationships? As many states within the U.S. are now embracing same -sex marriage through legalization processes, sexual consent laws or campaigns that prevent abuse in sexual relationships in colleges should follow the same path toward legitimacy. College campuses, including ours, advocate for safe, fair and peacefully diverse communities for their students, but in reality, there seems to be little effort in actually carrying out these standards.    As the preventive campaigns for sexual abuse on college campuses across the nation are increasingly becoming a legal fight, more investigations and studies must be carried out in specific areas in order to establish effectiveness beyond written statements or fines. This is a social problem that cannot be easily solved with mere legalization or individualized campus policy making. The current trend for this issue remains quite limited to one gender or to one stereotype. This is a contradiction to many college campus’s promises for providing a peaceful and safe community for diverse groups of people. We not only need to solve these horrific offenses for one perspective but need to also seek for  how best to  provide more effective and innovative solutions for diverse campuses as a whole.Hae Rin is a freshman columnist at The Daily Cardinal.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/rebecca-blank-lori-berquam-discuss-uw-madison-funding-tuition,"October 2, 2014 | 10:16pm CDT","If the deep cuts to the UW System in the state’s last budget are maintained, education programs at UW-Madison will be cut 4 percent across the board, Chancellor Rebecca Blank said in a meeting with student media Thursday.“That’s a big cut at a university like this,” she said.Budget issues were a reoccurring concern as Blank and Dean of Students Lori Berquam fielded questions from campus press.After Republicans expressed outrage over the news that the UW System was holding large cash reserves, the Gov. Scott Walker administration approved a 2013-’15 budget with deep cuts to the UW System.UW-Madison was able to offset the cuts by dipping into the reserves, but there is not enough of a surplus to last through the next years, Blank said.Walker sent a letter to state agencies in July expressing a “zero growth” policy, saying besides adjustment for inflation, agencies should not increase budget requests in the 2015-’17 biennium.However, in August, the UW System Board of Regents sent a budget proposal to the governor that included $95.2 million in new state funds. The governor will use the proposal to present a budget to the legislature in February.In the meantime, Blank discussed ways to raise money. She voiced support for a tuition freeze for Wisconsin students that is being advocated by Walker and UW System President Raymond Cross. She added, however, that a tuition freeze without accounting for inflation was not a sustainable plan.Blank also reiterated her recent remarks about upping out-of-state tuition for undergraduate and graduate programs. UW-Madison undergraduates from outside of Wisconsin and Minnesota now pay $26,660 per year. Out-of-state students at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, in comparison, pay $41,811.Although she doesn’t want UW-Madison to lead the Big Ten, Blank said the university’s out-of-state tuition falls more than $2000 below average.“We are not at the bottom of quality in the Big Ten,” Blank said.She added that she is working to create “a deeper pool of financial aid dollars” through an alumni fundraising campaign to offset any tuition increases.The two administrators also responded to the “Yes Means Yes” law that recently passed in California, which legally redefines consent as an affirmative and clear statement, rather than the absence of resistance. Both Blank and Berquam said they did not have any immediate desire to see a similar bill in Wisconsin.Berquam said some recent sexual assault legislation has not yet been implemented on campus and that there are already some contradictions between different policies.“I’d kind of like to maybe slow down just a little bit and make sure that the ‘why’ we’re doing it is as important as what we’re doing,” Berquam said.Blank said she’d also like to see data on the efficacy of the “Yes Means Yes” legislation before considering something similar. Both Blank and Berquam, however, expressed support for the California law’s emphasis on consent.“Consent has to be at the core of what we do,” Berquam said.","Rebecca Blank, Lori Berquam discuss UW-Madison funding, tuition",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/campus-sexual-assault-deserves-no-second-shot,"October 2, 2014 | 12:48am CDT","California recently passed a bill known as the “yes means yes” law, which requires positive affirmation of intent for sexual activities on college campuses. The new law states that silence or a lack of resistance does not constitute confirmation and any sexual activity taking place without consent would therefore be punishable as sexual assault. Furthermore consent can be revoked at any time and the previous affirmation would then be void. Proponents of this law applaud the California Legislature for taking the first step to end victim blaming. Instead of asking the victim if, how and when they said no, the investigation will shift its focus to the accused. This new law serves as a positive example to the rest of the country that it is time to take action against the epidemic of sexual assault on college campuses. But while progress is happening in California, there is troubling news closer to home.The Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity on the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee campus received national attention after a Sept. 12 party where members were accused of color-coding female guests with a red or black “X” on their hands and slipping date rape drugs into their drinks. Three females and one male were sent to the hospital following the party. All three females had a red “X” on their hand while the male’s “X” was black. The male later told police that he had been drinking from a female friend’s cup who bore a red “X.” The fraternity’s chapter and affiliation with UWM is currently suspended while it undergoes investigation. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, when officers asked one of the three women hospitalized after the party if this specific event was unusual for the fraternity, she responded: “No this is how it usually is. Girls always get wasted there.”That type of relaxed attitude about the inner-workings of the fraternity is something that unfortunately permeates many college campuses that have Greek life. Sexual assault is not a problem reserved for greek communities alone, however. UW-Madison has had three reported sexual assaults in residence halls within the past two weeks. We saw as alarming and surprising, yet for some reason the cloud of “frat culture” keeps similar reactions in check when particularly sinister news like that from Milwaukee breaks.We fully acknowledge that the negative idea of “frat culture” does not apply to all fraternities. In most cases, the bad steals the spotlight from the good. Fraternities hold many positive events and allow young men on campus to connect with a tight-knit group of mutually supportive people throughout their college years and beyond. But perhaps this tight-knit group aspect is what also led to unfortunate events at UWM.Groupthink can lead to actions supported by few, but stopped by no one. We hope not all of the fraternity members who attended the investigated party were in on the crime. But it is difficult to stand up for something, especially if you go against someone like your fraternity brother in the process. We can imagine the situation, and no one really knows how they will react until it is right there in front of them. But we need to seriously consider how clear a decision it is to sacrifice something like the honor of a fraternity for the safety of women.There also needs to be strict principles set for fraternities. When an individual is caught and found guilty of sexual assault or intent to commit sexual assault, they face the penalties associated with their crime. When a fraternity does the same thing, we hope they are held to an even higher standard because of the image it holds on campus. Individual or group, there should never be second chances when it comes to a serious issue like sexual assault.What is your view on campus sexual assaults? Is there a better method to fixing the sexual assault problem? Are you a member of the greek community? We want to hear from you.

The organization made a financial eligibility presentation to SSFC last Thursday seeking funding.SSFC members voiced concerns on which programs in the group’s financial plan, such as a movie night that involves a dialogue and a working class art night, should be considered core or supportive programming. Members also questioned which events qualified as experiential learning.Ultimately, committee members determined the WSCU’s plans meet the funding criteria, voting 11-0 in favor of the organization’s eligibility with four abstentions.SSFC also heard an eligibility presentation by the student organization PAVE.PAVE focuses on preventing sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking. In its presentation, PAVE outlined a number of programs and campaigns it considers to be core components of its financial plan.Among these programs are events tailored to awareness months like domestic violence in October and sexual assault in February.PAVE also outlined plans for a bus and poster campaign aimed at setting a new standard of response and prevention to sexual assault, domestic violence and stalking.The organization described many of the campaigns and programs as having the educational benefit of providing “civic knowledge and engagement” on the issues at hand. SSFC will vote on PAVE’s funding eligibility Thursday.In special orders, SSFC discussed its expectations for what it wants to hear from the Wisconsin Union regarding its budget plans. SSFC aims to establish expectations for Union financial staff early in the process to avoid later confusion.SSFC Vice Chair Thuy Pham talked about the importance of knowing how student segregated fees are spent by the Union.“This committee was put out for a specific reason: So we can oversee the spending of student segregated fees,” Pham said.","SSFC grants eligibility to Working Class Student Union, hears from PAVE",UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/09/the-dirty-bird-what-is-hookup-culture-and-how-do-i-get-one,"September 14, 2014 | 9:47pm CDT","Sex. It’s what you do!That joke is so two thousand and late, amirite? But that’s the whole point! No, not that we grew up during a time when jokes were so much easier to make and sixth grade was so much easier to pass.Instead, we have the idea that sex is something most people will engage in throughout their lifetimes, and that it needs to be celebrated! Woohoo sex-positive sentence!Everyday on my News Feed, I see people posting about the detriments of hookup culture on college campuses. With constant articles by BuzzFeed.com and EliteDaily.com about hookup culture ruining the prospects of sanity and marriage, one would think the culture is ruining our entire civilization! While many have valid points, I’m here to argue that the pros outweigh the cons.Before we get started, we have to define hookup culture. Hookup culture is seen as a societal expectation where people engage in sexual activity with partners to whom they have no romantic commitment. Let’s get started! Pro: It allows us to be honest.Can you believe people used to lie to have sex? “Sure, I’ll love you forever! Now, let’s get it on!” Because people are empowered to bone whenever they want to, with whomever consents, we no longer have to make promises in order to get it in. When we make people “work for” or “earn” sexual activity, we are turning our bodies and our sexuality into a commodity! Gross!Fuck-buddy and friends-with-benefits relationships oftentimes have “the talk,” outlining different reasons each person is not interested in a romantic, long-term situation with that specific person. “The talk” helps people who want to get laid without commitment make their objectives clear. Mature people always engage in “the talk.”We can also be honest about what we like and what we are excited to try without any pressure. If our partner is judgmental, so what? We never have to see them again. Con: We are too optimistic.Sometimes during “the talk,” people say what they want their partners to hear. We tend to match the language of our partners, maybe agreeing to wanting things because the person we’re with wants them. Trouble, trouble, trouble.In many situations, the person agreeing halfheartedly wants a more romantic situation than they’ve been presented with. They believe their R-rated relationship will go through a “natural progression” from doing it to dating. And sometimes, it happens!However, be wary. When someone says they aren’t interested in a relationship, they usually mean it. There are tons of reasons a person may want to avoid romance and feelings and love and happiness, and although their excuses may not make sense to us, they don’t have to. Consent and permission go beyond fornication, and just like when from boinking to beauing, we want to be with someone who wants to be with us too. Pro: It destigmatizes sexuality.In the world we live in, having sex with people we don’t know is super acceptable. And that fucking rocks! People used to be shamed for doing what they wanted with their bodies, but no longer! Long live la revolution! Con: America has conservative ideals.Some people still judge others based on their fun activities. What goofballs! They’re just jealous of how uninhibited and fun people can be.Although we have the right to believe what we want and disagree with the actions of others, it is never our job to tell other people how to live their lives. If we find ourselves becoming critical of how our friends spend their time behind closed doors, maybe we should ask ourselves why. Are we subscribing to outdated morals? Are we jealous? We should take a second to think before behaving in ways that may harm others. Moral of the story: Stop. Judging. If we are not into hookup culture, we don’t have to engage in it. Speaking of which...Pro: We have the power to engage or not engage.You can either buy into hookup culture or you won’t have any fun and won’t find a partner and won’t find friends.Oh wait! That’s ridiculous! We can totally divert from a culture with which we’re uncomfortable! By, like, not having sex with people we don’t want to. And also like, not hooking up. If we want a relationship, we should find other people in the same boat instead of goading people uninterested in dating us to do so. Con: People are stupid.News anchors, bloggers, vloggers and “citizen journalists” aka angry ex-girlfriends often denounce hookup culture. People often declare they are “forced” into it in order to enjoy college. Unless we’re sexually assaulted, which is an atrocious crime and NOT a given in hookup culture, we haven’t been forced into anything.  Pro/Con: There are less options.The kind of people who want to hook up all the time don’t necessarily want to date people right now. Maybe they’ll change their tunes when the right person comes along, but for now, we should focus on finding people who are interested in the same kind of relationship we’re looking for. Luckily, if we choose to abstain from hookup culture, we’ll know our options are more likely to look for the same things we are. Win-win! Inflamed by Alex’s opinions? What about her non sequiturs?

USSA decided to focus on sexual assault and prevention as well as college access and affordability.USSA is currently trying to come in contact with organizations that can help advance their sexual assault and prevention campaign.

LaTonya Johnson, D-Milwaukee, state Rep. Evan Goyke, D-Milwaukee, and state Sen. Nikiya Harris-Dodd, D-Milwaukee, applauded both the district attorney and assistant district attorney of Milwaukee County for bringing to justice Roy Kennard Weatherall Jr., who a Milwaukee jury found guilty of 14 counts of sex trafficking, sexual assault, child abuse and witness intimidation last week.The three lawmakers also pledged action in the upcoming legislative session to combat what has become an increasingly notorious national issue. Goyke said none of the six bills proposed last legislative session that pertained to human trafficking passed.“One of the reasons the state will be different in this legislative session is that the attorney general’s office is a critical partner in the fight against human trafficking … that person, either Susan Happ or Brad Schimel, will bring a perspective and a voice to the discussion,” Goyke said. “Even though things were stalled last session, there’s a new set of players and huge turnover in the Legislature.”The legislative strategy for the trio will be to focus law enforcement attention on criminal organizations behind the trafficking and divert victims from the criminal justice system to preventative and recovery programs, which Goyke said are largely funded by the Wisconsin Department of Children and Family.“We, especially for juveniles, do not believe that those individuals who are coerced to sell themselves should face criminal convictions,” Goyke said. “Interestingly, think of the dollars we would spend prosecuting and incarcerating a young woman as a prostitute versus the cost of a stable house, job, foster care or programming. Almost always, that incarceration is far more expensive than the alternative.”",Milwaukee representatives pledge to tackle human trafficking,UWM

Since then, Novak earned both a masters and a doctorate degree in student personnel.Novak said he decided to come to UW-Madison largely because of the housing staff’s commitment to serving students, adding that he was also drawn by the university’s residential learning communities and the opportunity to work with UW-Madison’s in-house dining service.Since moving to Madison in the middle of this summer, Novak said he has observed University Housing’s dedication to quality service first-hand.“I’ve been left with a fantastic housing program, with outstanding staff dedicated to our housing program, to our mission, to our core values, and really to making the residential experience the best that it can be,” he said.As he settles into his new leadership position, Novak said he intends to focus on providing students with continued education about alcohol safety.“I see police logs daily and it’s not unusual to see a student transported to detox for alcohol intoxication, and one is too many,” he said.During the past week, University Housing, which houses approximately 94 percent of the freshman class as well as a fraction of upperclassmen, navigated the successful move-in of thousands of students.“Having been here for six weeks over the summer, it’s great to see the energy and pulse of the campus back,” he said.Novak, who refers to himself as a sports fanatic, said he looks forward to the football team’s first home game this weekend, as well as to getting to know Madison in the coming months.“It’s been a tremendous six weeks,” Novak added. “I feel like I’m at home already.”UWPD denounces binge drinkingIn response to a recent incident in which a UW-Madison student was transported to detox with a .338 blood alcohol content, university police released a statement advising students to exercise caution if consuming alcohol.It is important to consider that consuming excessive amount of alcohol can put students at risk, both academically and physically.

He was expected to join UW-Madison’s 2014 freshman class in the fall and was visiting the university, escorted by sophomore linebacker Leon Jacobs, when the incident occured.Jacobs testified his job as Cizauskas’ student host was to show him a good time, according to Channel 3000. They both consumed multiple rum shots and attended a party hosted by track team members. Following the party, Cizauskas went to Sellery Residence Hall, where the assault took place.Cizauskas waived his right to a preliminary hearing March 31 and pled not guilty.The jury reached the verdict after about five hours of deliberation and found the defendant guilty after testimony from the woman and Cizauskas, according to the WSJ article. A main point of contention that played out in both tesitmonies was whether the sex was consensual.Both testified they had had consensual sex in the past, most recently in July of that year, but the woman said she became disinterested in sexual relations with Cizauskas after going to UW-Madison her freshman year.Assistant District Attorney Rachel Sattler said in her closing argument that no matter the backstory, the woman did not want to have sex with him that night, and it was her right to say no, according to the WSJ article.Tim Verhoff, Cizauskas’ lawyer, argued in closing that the woman had consensual sex with Cizauskas and later felt regret. Police recovered a few key text messages indicating she wanted him to come to her room, which the woman had erased.“This was a consensual act,” Verhoff said, according to the article. “It’s something she might have felt bad about afterward.”However, Sattler said the extensive processes the woman has voluntarily gone through following the assault indicate it was more than regret.“[The woman] didn’t have to tell anyone what happened,” Sattler said, according to the article. “She told because she was sexually assaulted. It’s as simple as that.”Other issues included how long it took Cizauskas to actually stop after the woman told him to and what she actually said to indicate she wanted to have sex with him. He could not immediately recall what words she had used to give consent, when he was asked to do so during questioning from Assistant District Attorney Matthew Moeser, according to the WSJ article.According to the WSJ article, Cizauskas and his family appeared stunned by the verdict and quietly left the courtroom after hearing it read. He now faces up to fives years in prison and five years of extended supervision.A sentencing hearing has not been set but will likely occur in about two months.",UW-Madison football recruit Dominic Cizauskas found guilty of third-degree sexual assault,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/05/bro-dgers-must-act-to-prevent-sexual-assault,"May 29, 2014 | 10:01pm CDT","First off, I would like to say welcome and congratulations to every incoming student here at UW-Madison. Trust me, it may seem a little overwhelming at first but your college years are seriously some of the greatest years of your life, and if you open yourself up to all that this amazing campus and city have to offer than you will have plenty of fun. That being said, I need to switch gears and address all my fellow incoming male students or “BRO-dgers” if you will. Recently, a coward, whose name I choose not to mention as to never let the name live on, went on an insane killing spree in the densely populated living area for the University of California- Santa Barbara known as Isla Vista. The reaso this deranged killer felt it necessary to go on a killing spree that left six innocent people dead is because of his inability to seduce girls into having sex with him. While this is of course an act of insanity, it brings to light a greater issue that persists in the United States: the mindset that women are to be viewed as sexual objects that are open for the taking. As a college guy myself, I understand how beautiful the women of UW-Madison are. I understand how conversations with your friends about hooking up with girls can be some of the best conversations. But know that among the hooting and hollering you have with your boys, the girl that you are talking about is not some foreign land that you conquered or some play thing merely there for your enjoyment. She is a person and above that, she is your equal. Generations before us have unfortunately put forth the narrative that because men have had more access to education and are for the most part more physically imposing, they are inherently superior. Speaking as a son and a brother to some amazing women I find this ideal of superiority disgusting, and you should too. We need to make it our mission to treat the women of this University and the world with respect.Yes, sex is a part of college. For a lot of you this is the first taste of freedom, and by all means you should take advantage of that freedom by whatever means you see fit. There will be drinking, partying and all that good stuff but never lose sight of the fact that the girls of this campus owe you nothing. This attitude of misogyny led to the killings at UCSB ,and we can do our part as Badgers to abolish this mentality forever. If you find yourself looking to engage in some sexual activity with the girl down the hall, know that she has the right to say no. As Shakespeare once said, “Faint heart never won fair lady,” you are encouraged to approach that girl you find attractive , and if both of you mutually agree to whatever happens after that then by all means proceed.However, if that girl denies your approach, you need to back away and not take it personally. Take the denial in stride, swallow deep and get back out there. There really are plenty of fish in the sea and at UW-Madison that sea is plentiful so don’t worry! Get out there, have fun, make memories, respect women and never forget that NO means NO.Ryan is a senior majoring in Political Science. What would you like to tell the Freshmen class?

It was created partly in response to data showing only 13 percent of all college rape incidents get reported, according to a government release.Sexual assault victims often forgo reporting to the police because they fear retribution or have feelings of guilt and shame, according to the release.Aly Jarocki, a UW-Madison student and chair of the campus’ Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment group, said such apprehensions about coming forward after assault stem from the notion of rape culture, which she added is “alive and well” on college campuses.“I think a lot of it is [due to] the victim-blaming attitude,” Jarocki said. “A question about ‘well, how much did she drink?’ can seem really well-intentioned, but it’s still inferring that how much a woman drinks has to do with whether or not she gets assaulted.”The number of unreported sexual assaults grows even smaller when incapacitation is considered, with only 2 percent of all cases reaching the authorities, according to the release. Jarocki said this can partly be attributed to an alcohol consumption culture on college campuses.“People are able to look [and say], ‘oh it was just a bad drunk hook-up’ and I think that that definitely contributes to rape culture on a college [campus],” she said. “It’s expected that bad hook-ups happen sometimes and there’s definitely a difference between a bad hook-up and someone taking advantage of another person’s body.”UW-Madison Dean of Students Lori Berquam said one way to counter sexual violence is to make sure all campus community members are engaged and made aware of the dangers of sexual assault.“I think engaging our students as allies for each other is a continual effort,” Berquam said.The dean added it is important for UW-Madison to maintain a well-trained arsenal of responders and advocates “from all walks of life” who can offer support throughout the campus, something she said the university is already doing well.“I think this is an opportunity for us to continue to refine what we do,” Berquam said. “That doesn’t mean it’s still going to stop sexual assault, but my hope is that the more people that talk about this and indicate that it’s unacceptable, the fewer numbers we’ll have.”",UW-Madison campus responds to report from federal government’s sexual assault task force,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/04/letter-to-the-editor-pave-promotes-awareness-of-sexual-assault,"April 16, 2014 | 8:13pm CDT","Many people may not know that April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM), and one group on campus is here to change that. PAVE (Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment) is a student organization that aims to educate the public about sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking on campus. Considering that 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men will experience sexual assault in their lifetime, these are topics that need to be addressed in the campus community. That’s what PAVE is here for, especially this month.The term “sexual assault” gets tossed around frequently, but not everybody knows what it really means. It is defined as engaging in any kind of sexual contact or activity with someone who has not given consent, from unwanted touching to rape. Consent is a clear and freely given “yes,” not the absence of a “no.” Beyond the definition, there are undoubtedly many questions regarding sexual assault. Here are a few of the most commonly asked questions:What if both people involved are drunk?When both parties involved have recently consumed alcohol, it’s especially important to get consent. Whenever alcohol is involved, be aware of the signs that your partner does not have the mental capacity to give consent such as slurring words, stumbling or short-term memory loss. It’s always important to get consent for all sexual acts, not just sex itself, because consent is an ongoing process of communication. This includes acts ranging from unwanted kissing or groping to rape, and everything in the middle. In addition, although 25 percent women will be sexually assaulted over the course of their lifetime, only 5 percent of men are perpetrators. This means that this small group of male perpetrators are repeat offenders, and these acts are not accidental. In fact, some perpetrators use alcohol to either justify their actions or make their victims more vulnerable.If there is no violence or force involved is it still considered rape?Rape or sexual assault does not always involve physical force. Some perpetrators use coercion, or emotional or psychological force, to manipulate an individual into participating in sexual activity. Always remember that a coerced “yes” does not equal consent! Coercion can be very subtle, and may include pressuring someone, like not allowing them to leave or even threatening them.What if I was sexually assaulted after drinking alcohol and I’m underage? Is it possible to get a ticket if I report the assault? According to the university’s Responsible Action Guidelines, it is standard practice for the UWPD to not give an underage consumption ticket to a victim of sexual assault if they choose to report the incident to the police. If you’re not comfortable reporting the incident to the UWPD, you can also report a sexual assault to the Dean of Students who will not report to the police unless you give them permission. There are many other resources available on campus for those affected by sexual assault, including University Health Services, as well as the Rape Crisis Center of Dane County and its 24-hour crisis line.Want to know more about PAVE, SAAM, or sexual assault?

Some of these include baseball, apple pie, BBQing on the fourth of July and given the wars of the past decade, an appreciation and gratitude for all branches of our military. American soldiers are trumpeted as heroes by our media, and deservedly so. Unfortunately, this heroism is blemished by a vile undertone of sexual abuse.?Like numbers for sexual assault in general American society, numbers for sexual assault and rape have begun to skyrocket among military members in the past decade. While our armed forces are integrated with both male and female soldiers, they are still an overwhelmingly male dominated occupation. Men, and especially women, serving in- field or as military intelligence are subjected to unacceptable amounts of sexual aggression and abuse from their fellow soldiers and even commanders. Between July 2012 and June 2013 there were 3,553 reported sexual assaults according to military statistics. That number was a 46 percent increase from the previous year, and who knows what the numbers are when including unreported cases.?Most recently, the sexual assault case against Army Brigadier General Jeffrey Sinclair has brought the issue to the public’s attention. Sinclair, the former deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne Division as well as commander of the armed forces in Southern Afghanistan, pled guilty to charges of committing adultery, engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women, obstruction of justice and conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman.?Sinclair was accused of many counts of sexual abuse, but there were a few in particular that stood out. The captain who served as his Arabic -speaking adviser, said that Sinclair forcefully fondled her breasts and crotch in plain sight of other troops on a convoy plane to Kuwait and later forced her to perform oral sex. According to the accuser, she was too intimidated to come forward against the general because he told her that if she told anyone about their affair, he would kill her entire family in “a way no one would ever know.”?Despite the evidence toward the general, in addition to pleading guilty, his punishment amounted to roughly a $24,000 fine. He will avoid jail time entirely. The accuser’s lawyers even went as far as to call this ruling a “slap on the wrist.”While the sacrifice Sinclair has made for our country is not under question, it does not excuse his actions in any form. It truly is a shame a man of this importance could behave so reprehensibly, especially while in command during war time, and essentially emerge from the courts-martial scot-free. ?This case is only the most recent and public case that focuses on the military’s best-kept secret. I understand war means these soldiers are subjected to life-threatening and horrible situations in deployment. Therefore, dignity toward our fellow countrymen must be maintained. It pains me to think that some of these soldiers return from fighting, only to be just as afraid in their own barracks. But these horrible acts are inexcusable. ?The Uniform Code of Military Justice provides the legal oversight and rulings for any military trials. I agree the military should be its own separate entity and have its own individual legal system apart from the rest of the United States, however, it seems to me the UCMJ is either playing favorites in its rulings or is in drastic need of change. Sinclair’s punishment will only serve as an example to other soldiers that it is OK to sexually abuse other soldiers as long as you have the rank and position high enough to earn a free pass. While the military may tend to lag behind public opinion with regard to change, the severity of this issue mandates that our nations’ heroes start being more heroic toward their fellow soldiers.Ryan is a junior majoring in political science.

The Division of Student Life proposed the draft in a University Affairs meeting Tuesday.The new procedures would give sexual assault victims more privileges in a trial than acting solely as a witness, as currently outlined in chapter 17 of the UW System. The victim would be able to appeal the case under the new procedures.The draft outlines procedures for investigations into sexual assault, sexual harassment, dating or domestic violence and stalking, hopefully encouraging more victims to come forward, according to Kipp Cox, Dean of Students Office assistant dean and director.UW campuses are entitled to their own procedures, as long as they are consistent with the system’s guidelines and are approved by the Board of Regents. The draft would add to UW System procedures and “equal the playing field” between the accused and accuser, Cox said.UW System procedures are not currently in compliance with the 2013 federal Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act or with the U.S. Department of Education’s “Dear Colleague” Letter.The letter, administered to campuses around the country in 2011, outlines necessary university action in Title IX cases. Title IX is a federal law giving women athletes equal opportunities in sports and requires universities to address sexual harassment allegations.The “Dear Colleague” Letter is not law, but Cox said university investigations will most likely be judged by the procedures outlined by the letter.Both Michigan State and Northwestern are currently under investigation for how they handle sexual assault investigations.“We don't want to have Wisconsin's name out there as a school that’s been accused of botching a sexual assault, stalking, domestic violence kind of case,” Cox said.UW-Madison has received seven sexual assault reports this semester, compared to two cases last spring.

As much as I appreciate your bringing the issue of pornography to light, there were several aspects of the recent opinion piece that I take issue with. There is much foolishness and posturing present on both sides of the pornography debate,  so I will try to be as direct as possible. While I am glad that in the article, “Pornography becoming normalized in society,” you brought attention to the stigma and shame that surround many aspects of sexuality in our society, I disagree with the insinuation that both the production and consumption of pornography is a healthy expression of sexuality. I agree that it is essential to eliminate personal feelings of shame regarding one’s natural sexuality. However, it is imperative that we conserve the elements of intimacy and privacy that are inherent to a healthy, consenting sexual relationship. These elements are nonexistent in pornography, which by definition is voyeuristic and public.Beyond this broad moral objection, I have a few specific concerns. Firstly, widespread use of pornography indicates that it is a mainstream phenomenon, and nothing more. Normalcy does not universally translate into a positive social effect.Secondly, pornography is less an “art form” than an industry (with both legal and illegal incarnations) with questionable, to say the least, working conditions for its laborers. This is especially true in the further reaches and underground of the Internet. I would not be comfortable endorsing pornography as a general phenomenon until clearly demonstrable political and social steps have been taken to prevent human rights abuses across the industry. To promote pornography as it stands, especially in the name of one’s own “healthy” sexuality, seems self-indulgent.Thirdly, a sizable amount pornography glorifies the objectification, degradation, and humiliation of women, in particular through dramatic depictions of rape, gang-rape, child abuse, and other forms of sexual assault. I am not at this point comfortable with positing a connection between this phenomenon and American “rape culture”. However, the fact that we live in a culture that is already so at peace with sexual assault makes me uncomfortable. I am not in favor of any further celebration or endorsement of this illegal, unconscionable act.Even if these points do not invalidate your argument, I do believe they merit mentioning in any conversation regarding pornography or modern American sexuality.How do you feel about the pornography industry in the United States? Should there be harsher workplace regulations to improve safety? Please send all of your feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com. ",Porn acceptance questioned,UWM

Regular readers may have already noticed Alex Tucker isn’t writing this column; she is currently taking a semester leave and handed over the duties of writing the Dirty Bird to me. Like Alex, I am a peer-to-peer sexual health educator at UW-Madison. I look forward to writing the Dirty Bird this semester. Hopefully I can fill the big shoes left for me. As always, the Dirty Bird is here to titillate, educate and open our minds to the wonderful world of sex.I’m going to take a bit of liberty and forego answering a question for the first article and go over some basic sexual health mumbo jumbo… or, one bit of mumbo jumbo: sex positivity.Sex positivity is the key to my approach to sexual health and sexual health education. It’s a broad term, which generally describes taking an open-minded and respectful view of people’s individual sexualities and desires.It celebrates a healthy diversity of sexualities and sexual desires, as well as relationship structures and personal choices so long as they are based on consent. Although the precise definition of sex positivity can change over time and place, consensual sex must remain a constant.  Sometimes this term is misconstrued with being the same as other theories on sexuality like free love. Sex positivity stands apart based on its open acceptance of all combinations of sexual behavior, assuming they are consensual.Concepts similar to sex positivity show up in some unexpected places. The World Health Organization has a specific definition of “healthy sexuality” that embraces an inherent belief in pleasure as being an important and perhaps essential part of healthy sexuality. The WHO defines healthy sexuality as being “a state of physical, emotional, and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease … Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relations as well as the possibility of having pleasurable … sexual experiences.”This definition includes the lack of coercion or violence (i.e. sexual assault) and discrimination. These are “sexual rights” as described by WHO and almost perfectly align with the definition of sex positivity. The potential for pleasure, the inclusion of consent, the lack of violence or discrimination and the equal access to all these things to all people are important factors in my approach to sexual health.Remaining sex positive isn’t always the easiest thing though, even for the best of us. It certainly isn’t something we are taught in school and has to be learned. Or rather, the types of sexual aversions often taught in school, at home or by the media need to be unlearned to achieve sex positivity.That’s not to say we should embrace all sexual behavior and relationship types like they’re our favorite things in the world. Sex positivity is about being open to people’s individual choices if they don’t have an adverse effect on their health, the health of their partners or the people around them. We might not be into having threesomes with our best friends for example, but just because somebody we know is, doesn’t mean we can’t still respect them and they can’t respect us.This concept and sex positivity can be succinctly summed up in this simple phrase: Don’t yuck somebody’s yum and don’t yum somebody’s yuck. We can all like and enjoy different things in a very healthy and pleasurable way, but we don’t need to force those pleasures and desires onto other people in the same way we wouldn’t want others’ desires forced onto us.We certainly can talk about all those desires in an open and fun way though!

Judge Doyle Square faces another round of planning after approvalSeveral years of planning for Madison’s downtown redevelopment plan saw an approval by the Common Council late September, only to hear just a month later that the project’s economic generator had fallen through.The Judge Doyle Square project includes a 216-room hotel, retail space and public and private parking, which developers would build on the two blocks holding the Madison Municipal Building and the Government East parking ramp. The plan also anticipated housing the headquarters of Exact Sciences—a company expected to bring at least 400 jobs to Madison by 2019.Shortly after the council approved the Judge Doyle Square project, however, Exact Sciences experienced a drop in stock value. Facing financial difficulties, the company was forced to move their would-be headquarters to University Research Park.With Exact Sciences out of the picture, Mayor Paul Soglin said the city would begin reviewing other development plans for Judge Doyle Square the city received in May. —Laura Grulke9. UW-Madison faces end to decades-long loan programMore than 5,000 UW-Madison students faced the elimination of one of the oldest federal loan programs in the country Sept. 30 due to a lack of U.S. congressional approval. The Federal Perkins Loan granted money to institutions where low-income undergraduate and graduate students could borrow money directly from their school. Several Wisconsin politicians including U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., along with UW System and university administrators, lobbied to extend the loan program for an additional year.According to an Aug. 31 interview with former UW-Madison Director of the Office of Student Financial Aid Susan Fischer 99 percent of students paid their loan payments in full during the previous academic year. “Because they’re paying us back, they feel an obligation. They’re paying UW-Madison back,” Fischer said. “You feel closer to Madison than you do the Department of Education or some payment center. We think there’s a stronger emotional connection.”—Ellie Herman8. Madison delays implementation of police body camerasDespite police departments across the country beginning to have officers wear body cameras while on duty, Madison’s Common  Council decided to wait on the issue.Numerous concerns arose, including cost and privacy, after a special ad hoc committee was tasked with studying the issue. A report released earlier this year found that the total cost of the cameras and storage space totaled $955,000 across the city’s five police departments. “The most important finding from going over everything was that there is no strong feeling or detailed argument in favor of police officers wearing body cameras,” said Jacquelyn Boggess, co-director of the Center for Family Policy and Practice, a nonprofit that conducted interviews with community members and police officers to get their views. Even though the pilot program is currently on hold, MPD Public Information Officer Joel DeSpain said the city will likely use body cameras in the future.—Negassi Tesfamichael7. Missouri student activism inspires campus involvementIn November, University of Missouri System President Tim Wolfe resigned because of protests by students on campus and the threat of a strike by the football team. Inadequate responses from university administrations regarding racial inequalities on campus sparked the Concerned Student 1950 movement and eventually led to a response from other universities across the nation. To show their support for the students at the Mizzou, students and community members at UW-Madison marched down State Street days after the Mizzou officials’ resignations. The crowd of more than 1,000 people chanted “black lives matter” and “racism is at Mizzou, it’s on our campus too” as they made their way from the top of Bascom Hill to the steps of the Capitol. The peaceful demonstration was commended by UW-Madison administration, such as Vice Provost for Student Life and Dean of Students Lori Berquam. —Peter Coutu6. Board of Regents waives UW-Madison nonresident enrollment capThe UW System Board of Regents voted Oct. 9 to approve a four-year drop of the enrollment cap for nonresident students at UW-Madison, beginning Fall 2016.UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank proposed the idea in February, initially calling for the cap to be increased to 30 percent from its previous 27.5 percent.Blank said in an Oct. 2 online post that this measure aims to draw high school graduates into Wisconsin, making up for a decline of in-state high school graduates.The proposal included a guarantee of 3,500 seats for Wisconsin freshmen, which Blank called a “commitment to this state” in her post. The number was later increased to 3,600. The Associated Students of Madison expressed concern over the proposal in an open letter to Blank and UW System President Ray Cross.“If the university enrolls more students, we are highly concerned that the quality of education will not remain the same,” ASM members said in the letter.—Madeline Heim5. Lawmakers propose allowing concealed weapons on school propertySeveral Republican lawmakers came out in favor of a bill that would allow licensed individuals to carry concealed guns and knives on UW System campuses and inside university buildings. Supporters, like bill author state Rep. Jesse Kremer, R-Kewaskum, say the measure would keep students and faculty safe in the event of a shooting at a college, but many say allowing the weapons would only invite such an attack. UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank said the bill would endanger students on her campus.“The unfortunate reality is that campus gun-free zones merely serve to concentrate populations of vulnerable targets on campus and surrounding areas,” the bill authors said in a memo seeking co-sponsorship. “Students attending our taxpayer-funded colleges and universities should not be denied their Second Amendment right to carry a weapon for self-defense.”The bill would also strike a UW System rule that “generally prohibits persons from carrying, possessing or using any dangerous weapon on university lands or in university buildings or facilities,” according to a nonpartisan analysis of the bill. —Andrew Hahn4. Abortion bills spark debate at state, national levelsAbortion issues marked a major theme at the state Capitol, with legislators growing more interested in defunding Planned Parenthood and passing a ban on research using fetal tissue.Citing videos allegedly showing top Planned Parenthood executives discussing the sale of fetal parts, state politicians voted to redirect federal grant money appropriated from the agency to private services and local agencies.In addition, state Rep. André Jacque, R-De Pere, introduced a bill that would ban research using fetal tissue parts statewide. Jacque argued the measure ensures ethical research but opponents of the bill, including UW-Madison officials, argue it would have a chilling effect on important research. The state bills came as part of a larger national debate as to the role of abortion providers nationwide. The videos sparked similar efforts at the federal level to defund abortion providers. However, a fatal shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs has caused opponents to criticize the rhetoric as militant and an attack on women.—Andrew Bahl3. UW System, UW-Madison respond to tenure, shared governance changesEffects of the 2015-’17 Wisconsin state budget approved in July by Gov. Scott Walker became clearer this fall as the UW System and UW-Madison formed their own policies for tenured professors.UW System professors no longer have tenure defined by state statute in the 2015-’17 budget, which previously protected faculty members from losing their positions without fair cause.Throughout the summer, the Board of Regents formed a special task force devoted to creating a new tenure policy, which members plan to approve by the end of 2015. UW-Madison is also in the process of creating a tenure policy, specifically aimed for its own professors. Shared governance also faced new changes at the start of the academic year, as Walker passed a budget item that made all shared governance groups subordinate to UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank and the Board of Regents for rulings related to student life. According to a July 15 interview with Associated Students of Madison Chair Madison Laning, student life decisions could range from what email program the university uses to the construction of a new academic building on campus. Laning said she hopes Blank will continue to grant shared governance groups the autonomy to run as they did previously.—Ellie Herman2. Sexual assault repeatedly brought to students’ collective consciousnessThe beginning of a new school year saw frequent reports of sexual assaults sent to students by the UW-Madison Police Department, a phenomenon that Public Information Officer Marc Lovicott said is typical for the fall semester.One particularly gruesome attack occurred on the Capital City Trail, where a woman was beaten nearly to death. The assault inspired a “Take Back the Bike Path” march, in which almost 3,000 community members showed solidarity with the survivor through pouring rain. Police are still investigating the incident, now considered an attempted homicide, but most of the other attacks were never investigated because they were not reported to police. University officials released the results of the Association of American Universities survey taken last spring that revealed higher instances of sexual assault at UW-Madison than the national average. The results led to many campus discussions about preventing sexual assault and how the university can better equip students to report and deal with the lasting impressions of such crimes.  Some of the proposed changes include a new student Title IX Advisory Committee, which will help inform university policy surrounding sexual violence, and more online prevention programs like “Tonight.” —Bri Maas1. Walker flames out early in GOP primaryHoping to be Wisconsin’s first legitimate contender for the presidency since Bob La Follette carried the Progressive Party banner in 1924, Gov. Scott Walker surprised many with an early withdrawal from the Republican primary. Walker’s name shot the state Capitol’s halls to the lips of conservative kingmakers as he stood firm in the face of frenzied protests and a vicious recall election following his 2011 Budget Repair Bill. He continued to fuel his national ascent with sweeping tax breaks, right-to-work legislation, deep cuts to the UW System and an attempt to strike La Follette’s Wisconsin Idea from state statutes. Walker’s victories in the former “laboratory of democracy” enamoured conservatives like Rush Limbaugh who hailed him as “the blueprint for the Republican Party.” Walker announced his presidential bid in July as a presumptive frontrunner. Once thrust into the national spotlight, the Harley-riding governor stumbled through summer, comparing protesting public union employees to ISIS, suggesting a border wall with Canada and “punting” on evolution before being unceremoniously crowded out by flamboyant right wingers like Donald Trump.  Walker quit the race at Madison’s Edgewater Hotel, claiming he had been “called to clear the field” by God before promptly directing attention toward his sagging approval at home by signing laws barring the use of John Doe probes into illegal political activity and overhauling Wisconsin’s century-old civil service system. —Lucas Sczygelski",Top 10 News Fall 2015,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/12/transgender-inmate-at-dane-county-jail-describes-challenges-discrimination,"December 6, 2015 | 11:51pm CST","Lisa Mitchell, an inmate at the Dane County Jail, shared stories about the numerous challenges the criminal justice system has imposed on her due to her status as a transgender woman.Mitchell has been in and out of jail for years, her most recent sentence beginning in May due to what she described as “prostitution gone wrong.""According to Mitchell’s lawyer, Charles Ver Hoeve, Mitchell was homeless at the time, having been turned down from women’s shelters. She said she fears men’s shelters due to the harassment and bullying she has encountered there.In May, Mitchell was visiting her sister at a residence on the south side of Madison when a man approached her on the street and “propositioned her for sexual acts,” according to Mitchell and Ver Hoeve.According to Ver Hoeve, when Mitchell complied, the man began to beat her with his belt. When the police arrived, the man reported that he and his wife were walking when Mitchell attacked them.The incident report presented the man’s version of the story. Mitchell was sentenced to nine months in jail for the incident and two other counts of misdemeanor this May.Ver Hoeve said the man’s story was fabricated and contained many inconsistencies, describing it as implausible. He also criticized the police and agents’ handling of Mitchell’s case from the beginning.""If the agent was doing a better job at providing [Lisa] with appropriate housing and a place to be, then this kind of incident would not have happened,” Ver Hoeve said.Under the dim light in the visitation booth, Mitchell lifted her jail uniform to reveal deep scars from the incident and from several others throughout her life.Due to her gender identity, Mitchell is often placed with male inmates and has encountered severe harassment and abuse inside and outside of jail. Her treatment led to her placement in solitary confinement, which the jail said was for her own safety.Local LGBT activist Z! Lula Haukeness noted transgender inmates disproportionately suffer harassment and abuse in jails nationwide.“Trans women are placed on the men’s segregated side when they should be on the women’s side. They are often harassed by correctional officers, sexually assaulted by other inmates or officers,” Haukeness said.Mitchell said she has also faced discrimination outside of jail. The state statute against transgender individuals receiving care delayed her transition.After BadgerCare denied Mitchell hormone replacement therapy, which Haukeness said replaces hormones to help an individual’s inner identity align with their external sense of self, Mitchell filed a federal case against Medicaid.“We go through a great deal of gender dysphoria and the treatments help us cope,” she said. “People under the BadgerCare program being denied this treatment are at imminent danger for suicide.”Although Mitchell’s psychiatrist confirmed that she needed the treatment, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services denied Mitchell’s therapy due to the state statute.The department declined to comment on the issue.Mitchell said the therapy is inexpensive and believes the statute reflects bigotry against transgender individuals.“It’s not about money. It’s that they’re not supporting a man who wants to be a woman,” Mitchell said.Mitchell appealed the decision and won her case. She said she intends to work to change the statute statewide to eliminate exclusions against other transgender individuals, which she said violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.“It’s unconstitutional because you have transgender people who pay taxes and their tax money supports the BadgerCare Plus programs,” Mitchell said. “The very program they’re supporting denies their treatment.”U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., sent Mitchell a letter of support Oct. 9, agreeing she deserved coverage for hormonal therapy.UW-Madison professor Karma Chávez, whose research explores LGBT activism and policy, also stressed the importance of treatment for Mitchell and other transgender individuals.“Hormone replacement therapy has been shown across the board to be a vital medical treatment and there’s been a lot of research that has shown that those incarcerated have the right [to it],” Chávez said.Chávez explained Dane County should take every measure to cover Mitchell’s health-care needs whether she is incarcerated or not.“It’s a question of human rights, that she is a human who should be treated fairly regardless of whether [Mitchell] is incarcerated or not,” Chávez said. “She deserves adequate medical treatment.”Following a November hearing, Mitchell faces nine more months of jail time for three counts of misdemeanor.“Being in jail isn’t going to help [Lisa]. [She] needs to be out, in a safe place to live, and to have the kind of health care and mental health services and social services to reestablish and help get [her] back on [her] feet,” Ver Hoeve said.","Transgender inmate at Dane County Jail describes challenges, discrimination",UWM

Republicans normally have a 19-14 majority in the state Senate, but one of their members, state Sen. Roger Roth, R-Appleton, is away on Air National Guard duty.This means that only one Republican can vote against the bill, as the Democratic minority has pledged to fight the legislation.The body is expected to take up several amendments to the legislation to make it more palatable to members, including adding two former justices to the newly created election board in an effort to decrease gridlock. Another expected amendment would reinstitute requirements that campaigns report campaign donors’ employers.No amendments had been officially scheduled as of Thursday afternoon and it is unclear whether the rumored changes would be enough to ensure passage.Fitzgerald said he was confident the bills would advance.""I wouldn't be going to the floor if I didn't have the votes,"" he said, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.If the bills pass, the state Assembly would have to meet again to approve the amended versions. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, has indicated that he would call an extraordinary session of his body next week if necessary.The Senate is also set to take up bills that would allow retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons on school grounds, increase the statute of limitations for some types of sexual assault and increase the mandatory minimum sentence for people who illegally possess firearms.",Senate to take up election bills in Friday session,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/11/cardinal-view-soglin-slips-in-tackling-homelessness-issue,"November 4, 2015 | 10:35pm CST","Mayor Paul Soglin, since his landslide reelection victory in April 2015, has once again taken upon himself to address Madison’s homeless problem with rhetoric rather than substantial policy. Over the summer, Mayor Soglin proposed a new city ordinance which would tackle problematic loitering and lodging in Madison’s Central Business District. While not directly mentioning the homeless, the ordinance, which Madison’s Common Council has since voted down, attempted to clear out downtown of individuals whom were causing an undue nuisance to both city residents and the various business of downtown Madison.Soglin’s proposal, which he framed as a way to end the drug usage, public defecation and sexual assault in which transient individuals allegedly partake, has sound reasoning for protecting the city’s public health, but his political rhetoric is dominating the conversation. Instead of focusing his attention on expanding the number of shelter beds available in the Madison area—a woeful 379 beds and 383 temporary houses to accommodate the 3,370 total people who used shelters in 2013—Soglin has used his position to demonize those without shelter and claim that the “problem” stems from transient homeless individuals.His claim is far from true; according to the 2013 Dane County Homelessness report, only 23 percent of homeless families have lived in Dane County for less than one year, while 28 percent of homeless men and 27 percent of homeless women have resided in the county for less than one year. If the homeless were flocking to Madison because of our expansive benefits and accommodations, transient, non-permanent residents would take up a higher percentage of individuals served at shelters.Soglin’s assertion that the homeless population downtown who allegedly use drugs and alcohol in the Central Business District is blowing the alleged use of out of proportion. Less than 300 individuals, most of them single men, were reported as having issues with alcohol or other drugs. Again, while understandable, Soglin’s usage of fearmongering creates undue hostility toward the homeless, especially since most of homeless residents in the city, 45 percent, are families.With his position as mayor of a highly educated city, Soglin’s authority over issues provides him a platform to express opinions which city residents may use to inform their own views. It follows that using rhetoric and relegating homeless individuals to second-class status may enforce stereotypes and hold back individuals trying to break the cycle of poverty prevalent across the city.Our solution to this problem is to enforce policy over rhetoric when discussing an issue which directly impacts city residents, and the editorial board proposes further expansion of access to transitional and emergency housing. Access to quality, affordable housing is the key to allowing individuals to use their time searching for jobs or to receive health care.With his proposed ordinance to ban loitering around the business district, Soglin is tackling a sliver of the problem, and demeans individuals who have no connection to those allegedly causing issues downtown. The business community, which advocated for the removal of a popular gathering space for homeless individuals on the 100 block of West Mifflin Street, are focusing on an aesthetic change, one that pushes individuals out of the area without giving them a place to go. While it may be an important part of maintaining their storefront, businesses must realize that simply shoving the problem to another neighborhood will simply kick the proverbial can further down the road.Adding more affordable transitional and emergency housing would have a direct, positive impact on the lives of homeless people living in Madison. The downtown area has seen a rapid expansion in the number of high rise apartments which cater to more affluent students and young professionals, which generate much more revenue for developers and the city than homeless shelters. But, to the editorial board, the city should act like the progressive haven that Soglin asserts we are and help those that spend the winter outside in sub-zero temperatures. Four Madison alders have recently proposed using $3 million from the Affordable Housing Fund to develop three new facilities around Madison that would create 159 low-cost housing units and 180 apartments, and Soglin should support this initiative to further bolster underserved communities.Madison’s homeless problem is systemic, not episodic. Band-aid ordinances to tackle piecemeal parts of the problem are not the answer, and Soglin should focus his energy on expanding existing programs and advocate for private institutions to step up and take action. We will not be able to arrest our way out of these problems, and using demonizing rhetoric instead of equitable policy proposals will only hurt those who already have so little.",Cardinal View: Soglin slips in tackling homelessness issue,UWM

She expressed her views on intimate partner violence (IPV), domestic violence and dating violence. She emphasized to attendees how critical it is for college-aged students to become educated about these topics now to start the movement.“This is something that, unfortunately, will not end in our lifetimes,” Kim said. “It is going to be a continuous part of your life, but it is important to have these public conversations and frame it to really understand what’s going on.”She said that the pace of change is much faster than she has ever seen it, and the national and campus-wide conversations are amazing, but can be improved.“Sexual violence and IPV are so embedded in our culture, it’s one of the few forms, one of the very few types of violence, that when it happens, people, including survivors, will insist that it didn’t happen and they will blame survivors for their own victimization,” Kim said.Kim went in-depth about the numerous barriers victims face when self-identifying IPV. The aspects of the assault that make it hard to accept include knowing the perpetrator and experiencing non-physical assault. Both are easily dismissed, but are common cases of real assault, according to Kim.She also mentioned that not having sexual assault being taken seriously, concern for one’s personal or community image, as well as not wanting to involve law enforcement may prohibit victims from telling the truth.Kim suggested avenues to tear down barriers and build ways to protect and assist victims. This involves creating a culture of support and accountability that is survivor-centered, and promoting safe environments around campus.“To make this reality, we need to be educating ourselves and making more and more space for people to be listened to,” Kim said. “People want to share, they want support, they just don’t know who they can trust.”She parted with the idea that sexual assault is never the survivor’s fault, and the idea that it is can only be changed by a safe, community-healing environment.",Activist promotes creating a welcoming environment for sexual assault victims,UWM

These come as a result of the Clery Act, a federal statute that mandates colleges disclose crime information to students in a timely manner.This academic year has already seen five timely warnings of campus-related assaults from UWPD, and one sexual assault that occurred off-but-near campus and was ruled an attempted homicide by the Madison Police Department.Having an informed campus is important, but this information doesn’t come full circle. It’s hard to see WiscAlerts as valuable when we’re not seeing the whole story. As students, the knowledge of assaults means nothing if we’re not also seeing what is being done about said assaults. Where is the action? Where are the consequences?In a Sept. 18 article in The Daily Cardinal regarding sexual assault trends, UWPD Public Information Officer Marc Lovicott said he did not believe the semester’s influx of assaults was anything out of the ordinary.“All of these cases are troubling, but I don’t think it’s fair to say this year is exceptionally different than previous years,” Lovicott said.It’s upsetting as students to know that this is our “normal.” Regardless of historic trends, there needs to be more concern about this pattern and an active force to end this annual trend.Maybe UW hasn’t been seen as publicly inept at dealing with sexual assault as other universities have, like Virginia or Columbia, but we can’t wait until our school makes national headlines to enact change.UWPD has issued and funded a pro-social campaign targeted at male audiences, telling viewers “Don’t Be That Guy.” The campaign—consisting mostly of images of drunk, college-aged girls in party situations—is a start; it’s a beginning to the conversation. But the campaign targets a behavior, not an attitude.Our campus doesn’t need emotionally charged images, it needs facts.If you don’t know where to look, it’s near impossible to find the information a victim of sexual assault needs. We, members of The Daily Cardinal editorial board, had difficulty finding the procedures each campus outlet has in place to deal with a sexual assault.Who do you call if you’re the victim of assault? Most students would instinctively call 911 after an assault takes place. Yet depending on where the assault takes place, this may not be the “right” choice. There’s a difference in reporting an incident to UWPD and MPD—but to the average student, is that difference clear?Beyond the initial report, what happens? Information surrounding resources and support is not easily accessible, and the disciplinary process is buried in pages of university legalese.Carmen Hotvedt, the manager of Violence Prevention and Victim Advocacy for the End Violence on Campus program at University Health Services, said that the legal jargon associated with process is due to the language stemming from the state.“The student disciplinary code is a state administrative code, so the campus has limited flexibility to do anything differently,” Hotvedt said.She added that the university relies on campus and community services and organizations, like the Rape Crisis Center, to provide clarity on these documents and procedures, so the university is not outright providing interpretations.However, there is a difference between interpretation and clarification. It’s great that university and community groups are working to make this information digestible for students, but the university needs to take a more active role in this process.UW needs to invest resources in providing clear and concise information on steps to take in the event of a sexual assault. There is too much confusion and too many questions surrounding a topic we all know is worthy of adequate attention and care.We acknowledge that university officials plan to hold “engagement sessions” regarding UW’s culture of sexual assault. But there is only so much that can be tackled through discussion without an understanding of policy, which UW needs to recognize is an institutional responsibility.UW makes a great push toward exposure of academic integrity, so why not also focus on higher interpersonal accountability? There needs to be a clear set of expectations for students at this university.University officials have said there will be an expansion of the “Tonight” program, the assault education online course incoming students take the summer before their freshman year. Hotvedt noted that current plans have freshmen taking a “second dose” of “Tonight” some point in their first semester.With the program’s broad content, surface-level assessments and initial presentation to students before they even step foot on campus, it would be more beneficial to establish a system of breadth requirements or a freshman seminar to accurately educate students on the reality of sexual assault.We need more than posters hung around campus buildings. We need clear and accessible procedures for reporting assaults. We need transparent and commonplace sanctions for when an assault occurs. We need to stop talking about this trend and do something to change the statistic.What do you think of our perspective on the topic of the administration’s response to sexual assault on campus?

It delves into the deep, intimidating, often terrifying questions that you have been too afraid to ask. It is a rich exploration of the human psyche with sincere thought into what makes us this way and why. It is a show that is not always pleasurable to watch, but it forces you to feel, to question and to face the unsettling reality that you most likely will never learn the answers.The series is centered around a very simple concept: the big, cognitive question, “What if?” More specifically, what if two percent of the world population vanishes in a single moment? How will that moment affect the rest of humanity? The series is based on the novel by Tom Perrotta, who is co-penning the television interpretation with “Lost,” alum Damon Lindelof. Lindelof is used to tackling large theoretical questions, however, unlike “Lost” this show is not interested in giving answers to the phenomenon but on studying the repercussions of it.Season one centered on the Garvey family living in the small, fictional town of Mapleton when the event took place. Justin Theroux plays the father, Kevin, an emotionally conflicted, overall tormented human being ever since the event. Kevin was chief of police of Mapleton until he started sleepwalking, as well as seeing and hearing things that weren’t there. He lost his job, following in the footsteps of his father, ex-chief of police, who was locked up in a mental institution for similar reasons. Is he crazy or are the voices real? After the event, what is real? This is the type of question that sparks a reemergence of religious faith in society. Outside of Mapleton, rumors spread of a prophet in the community named Holy Wayne that can supposedly heal people’s suffering with a hug. People buy into this idea (which may or may not be legitimate) because they are desperately seeking to be healed. After such an extraordinary event, who is to question what is possible anymore?Kevin’s wife has left the family to join the mysterious and socially destructive neighborhood cult, the Guilty Remnant. The Guilty Remnant is a complicated group with interesting objectives. It took me a while to understand why they operate the way they do. They believe the rest of humanity does not deserve to exist since the “departures” left. Each member had a special connection to the departed. They dedicate their lives to preserving the horrific memory of the event, drowning themselves and their community in grief. They view denial and moving on as selfish. The Guilty Remnant do not speak, they wear all white, they eat mush, they rid themselves of all their belongings, they block off all mirrors and, on a symbolic note, they chain-smoke. They dig up the suppressed grief of the community and rub it right in their faces, daring them to feel the pain. Their non-violence welcomes people in society to physically assault them, adamant not to defend themselves. They relish each hit because they think they deserve it and the pain makes them feel better. They have nothing to lose because they already lost everything. The Guilty Remnant spark a savagery in society that has been buried by denial; dormant until provoked.The grief causes people to lash out and do things they never would have done before. Norah (Carrie Coon), Kevin’s love interest, is a victim of this. After her husband and kids disappeared, she gives in to the self-harm movement. She hires prostitutes to shoot her in the chest while she wears a safety vest. Jill Garvey (Kevin’s daughter) is a part of a changing teenage culture where recklessness is heightened to a new level. In the pilot, a group of them play a sick version of spin the bottle where self-inflicted burnings and sexual chokings are a deal of the draw.The theme of religious rebirth in face of the unexplained is explored further in this current season. Season two seems to be completely reinventing the series. It features a new location, new main characters, and a new opening theme. The strange opening scene, featuring a Neanderthal giving birth, made me check to make sure I was watching the same show. The scene is revealed to be an introduction into the new location, where the cavewoman is an ancient ancestor from the area. The town of Miracle, Texas, is flocking with tourists and religious nuts because it was the only area seemingly unaffected by the sudden departure—nobody in the town disappeared. The Garveys (plus Norah and an adopted baby) decide to move there to escape the chaos of Mapleton and start anew. Ever since the event, the locale has been revered as holy ground, where even the local water is sold as a holy souvenir. The first episode of season two focuses completely on a new family, the Murphys, who are revealed to be the new neighbors of the Garveys. It is clear that their story is going to be a central focus of season two, intertwining with the Garvey’s narrative.All the mysteries within the mystery are beyond intriguing and keep the viewers engaged. Season two continues its existential undercurrent and introduces new mysteries to scratch your head about. The rich content of the series makes it irrelevant that the overall mystery will never be solved, which is a monumental accomplishment for a generation of television that is pressured to reveal their cards when a show starts losing momentum. “The Leftovers” does not need this crutch because it is in constant momentum, continually giving more food for thought to the intricate, compelling and unexplainable characteristics of humanity. It is a show that not only demands to be watched, but also to be reflected on sincerely.How does ""The Leftovers"" make you feel? Let Ben know at bagolden@wisc.edu.

The UW-Madison Sexual Assault Climate Survey Task Force continued this conversation Monday, focusing on what the results mean for LGBTQ+ community members.Task force members gave a lengthy, detailed presentation on the survey’s key findings, including statistics showing a higher than average incidence of sexual assault at UW-Madison, especially for females, undergraduates or students with disabilities.Results also showed that non-heterosexual students disproportionately reported sexual assault and sexual misconduct as compared to heterosexual peers.“The disparities don’t surprise me, but it does surprise me how wide the disparities are,” said an audience member who wished to remain anonymous.Recommendations for how to improve campus climate included targeted prevention efforts and improved support for minority groups who are disproportionately affected, including those who identify as LGBTQ+.UW-Madison graduate student Valyncia Raphael and undergraduate student Kari Hajduk then opened up discussion for community members to give their own recommendations on how to improve future data collection, programming and services.“We know the limitations of how you ask questions and how you label things, that matters. I’ve definitely been vocal about that with the task force,” Raphael said. “As a black woman, I’m not represented by the data ... That’s very limiting for me.”Participants recommended improving existing support programs and student awareness of them, especially for minority groups. Audience members criticized UW-Madison Police Department’s “Don’t Be That Guy” campaign and other efforts for “norming” sexual violence.“While the numbers for men being assaulted are smaller, they’re significant, I think. Yet I don’t see any efforts towards preventing or helping those survivors,” an anonymous participant said.Hajduk said the task force will likely recommend more surveys in the future, whether they are in-house or done by another outside company.“After four years we have a whole new set of students on campus and if we’re continually pushing out new prevention efforts, very quickly we could get very different data each year,” Hajduk said.",LGBTQ community members discuss sexual assault survey results,UWM

Jesse Kremer, R-Kewaskum, and state Sen. Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, would exempt publicly funded universities from the state’s concealed carry laws, allowing those with a permit to bring weapons anywhere on campus, including inside buildings.It would also repeal UW System code, which “generally prohibits persons from carrying, possessing or using any dangerous weapon on university lands or in university buildings or facilities,” according to analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Reference Bureau.“The unfortunate reality is that campus gun-free zones merely serve to concentrate populations of vulnerable targets on campus and surrounding areas,” the bill authors said in a memo seeking co-sponsorship. “Students attending our taxpayer-funded colleges and universities should not be denied their Second Amendment right to carry a weapon for self-defense.”The authors cited an incident in Nevada where a student was sexually assaulted at gunpoint as rationale for the measure.“These types of crimes are only made easier when students are unable to adequately protect themselves,” the authors said in the memo. “It is time that we realize this fact before a similar tragedy strikes here in Wisconsin.”Currently, students can carry guns on campus but cannot bring them inside campus buildings.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/10/think-before-you-uber,"October 6, 2015 | 10:47pm CDT","In recent years, the taxi industry has been taken by storm by newcomers such as Uber and Lyft. With their user-friendly apps, strong customer service and cult following among youth, these companies seem like the wave of the future when it comes to getting from Point A to Point B. However, there is more than meets the eye when it comes to these companies, and maybe you should second-guess your decision on how you’re going to get to that party before you call Uber.With electronic hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft being so new, they are on the cutting edge of a new industry that has yet to be regulated. Although this can be a good thing, and can spark more contemporary policies for a forward-driving industry, it can also have its drawbacks when it comes to the safety and well-being of its users. For example, it is much harder to become a taxi driver than it is to become a driver for an e-Hail service.Although policies regarding taxi driver certification differ across the country, many cities require their drivers to pass a thorough background check and a health exam to make sure they have no conditions that could potentially endanger passengers. Also, many cities require drivers go under extensive driving courses, sometimes even including defensive driver training. Once they have completed these steps, they may take the city’s formal taxi certification exam, where they are tested on the city’s routes, landmarks and more. These exams vary in difficulty; for example, the notorious test in London requires anywhere from two to four years of studying to pass, while exams in the United States are less strenuous.Despite the many hoops that hopeful cabbies have to jump through before they can legally hit the roads, these precautionary steps ensure the safety of riders and the community. The path to becoming a driver for a rideshare company, however, is notably less difficult. Until recently, Uber drivers were not even required to undergo background checks and drivers with a history of sexual assault or other violent crimes were driving passengers who were none the wiser. However, the company has since revised its policy, at the expense of the consumer. Uber users are charged one dollar “Safe Driver Fee” for every ride, which covers the added cost of completing driver background checks. But the real question is, should consumers be the ones paying for the luxury of their safety, or is their safety their right? Why should Uber offset the cost of running a safe and reliable service onto its customers, when it is truly its responsibility to ensure that its drivers are qualified?Additionally, rideshare companies have been under fire for denying service to handicapped individuals. Neither Uber nor Lyft require their drivers to make their cars handicapped accessible and both companies are currently being sued in a class-action lawsuit for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act. There have been reported incidents of drivers putting passenger’s guide dogs in the trunk of their vehicle and of drivers noticing that their passengers were handicapped and subsequently abandoning them. This lack of regulation is not only horrifically discriminatory, but morally wrong. Companies who claim to be on the cutting edge of a new industry and who praise themselves for their customer service should not be so glaringly hypocritical by alienating an entire community from their service.Taxi services, however, are required by law to offer handicapped accessible services. While wheelchairs might not easily fit into a sedan or other small vehicle, companies have larger vans that are equipped to handle people with wheelchairs. While service might not be on-demand for users who wish to have handicapped accessible vehicles, they are guaranteed a ride, which is more than e-Hailing services can offer.Although the sleek look and modern concept of companies like Lyft and Uber can be intriguing and convenient, users should be armed with the facts before they choose to use them. These companies are on the bleeding edge of a new field, and governmental policies do not yet apply to them. So, if you want to be safe, you might want to memorize the Yellow Cab number.Samantha is a freshman majoring in communication arts and journalism. Have you used an Uber before?

We should be teaching that it’s never a woman’s fault. It’s never a person’s fault they were raped. It’s always on the rapist.”One in four undergraduate female students reported experiencing sexual misconduct in some way, according to the Association of American Universities Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct that featured data from UW-Madison.Many people are uneducated about the presence of rape culture and the frequency that sexual assaults happen in the community, Long said.“There are a lot of people in our community who don’t know about rape in its usual form,”Long stated, referring to the reality that most cases of sexual assault are not as violently brutal as the incident that took place on the Capitol bike path.Due to the assault’s severity, it is currently under investigation as an attempted homicide.“[People] are less concerned about it,” Long continued. “We don’t have a march every time someone is raped in Madison. People don’t even know how prevalent rape is in our community. We have a lot of educating we can continue to do.”Currently, Long and other community organizers are discussing a number of next steps, including a potential panel of speakers to educate the public on these issues of sexual assault and rape culture.",Community members explore how to end pattern of sexual assault,UWM

Devin LeMahieu, R-Oostburg, and state Rep. Samantha Kerkman, R-Salem, the statute of limitations for second- and third-degree sexual assault would be lengthened from six to 10 years.LeMahieu initiated the bill after a constituent wanted to press charges against a man who sexually assaulted her in college but couldn’t because the statute of limitations had expired.“Victims of these crimes deserve more time to come forward,” LeMahieu said. “They suffer trauma and mental anguish that prevents them from [doing so].”LeMahieu noted that the problem of sexual assault is prevalent in Wisconsin and the issue is particularly acute on college campuses, citing a recent UW-Madison survey which said that one in four female students experience sexual assault.Kerkman noted that the measure was approved by an Assembly committee earlier in the day. It also has the support of members of both parties, state Attorney General Brad Schimel and advocacy groups across the state.Wild animal ban meets oppositionA bill that would prohibit the possession of big cats, bears and crocodiles garnered more controversy, however.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/10/sexual-assault-dialogue-demands-inclusivity,"September 30, 2015 | 9:32pm CDT","It’s difficult to read campus newspapers recently without seeing accounts of sexual assault, yet the reactions of women on campus have been missing from this deluge of media. Whether the articles in question have been reports on the alarming number of campus assaults, accounts of local atrocities like the rape and near-homicide that occurred on the Capital City Bike Path, discussion of college surveys on the topic, news of reactionary student organizations or opinion pieces, these stories have not represented the fear and disgust expressed in conversation by many of the women I know.When concerns over safety dictate our actions, whether we go to that party and whether or not we feel secure biking home, it is hard not to feel frustration. Coverage in both The Daily Cardinal and The Badger Herald of the “Take Back the Bike Path” march, a community event providing support for the survivor of the Sept. 12 Capital City Bike Path assault, included the powerful voices of community women, but not students.A notable quote came from Ali Treviño-Murphy, an instructor at Villari’s Martial Arts and Fitness, who said, “Women are strong, physically, emotionally and mentally. Women survive every day. We survive sexism, we survive being disrespected, we survive on less pay … We fight every single day,” as reported by The Daily Cardinal.While Treviño-Murphy has crafted a rallying cry of support, women on campus have been primarily silent. To my surprise, the only opinion writers who have broached the topic of sexual assault are male. This is not an inherently bad thing; outrage and reactions to sexual assault shouldn’t be limited to a particular gender, but felt by the community as a whole. However, where it becomes problematic is in the scope of the argument.In an opinion column of The Daily Cardinal expanding on a stranger grabbing the butt of the male writer’s girlfriend, the writer discussed how he “became sick thinking that it took something like this for me to put it [sexual assault] in the correct context: to view it in a personal light.” This illuminates how important it is to bring men into the conversation, to find a way to make sexual assault personal for everyone, because as the writer pointed out, he is “coming at this from a perspective of an individual that belongs to a group [white, heterosexual men] that, historically, has not had to worry about sexual assault or sexual violence being committed against them.”Sexual assault is not a women’s issue, it’s not only a feminist issue—it is an intersectional issue that our entire campus community needs to fight.Although this opinion article was beneficial in the sense that it emphasized bringing sexual assault into the consciousness of white, heterosexual men on campus, the conclusion of the article focused on aftermath, not prevention. An attitude of retaliatory justice, in which we “hope and pray that if you [the stranger] ever do something like that again, an onlooker takes it personally enough to identify you and give your victims the justice they deserve” leaves out the most important part of the conversation: what we can do to prevent sexual assault from occurring in the first place. True justice needs to mean more than consequences for perpetrators.The student organization “We’re Better Than That: Men Against Sexual Assault” is another example of bringing men into the conversation. As reported by The Badger Herald, the growing group was founded after “realizing the absence of organizations that provide a platform for men to address sexual assault.” This organization seems to have good intentions, but falls short of delivering blunt, necessary conversation.Joe Naughton, a co-founder of the group, is quoted by The Badger Herald as saying, “We do not like the term ‘rape culture.’ As the young men of [We’re Better Than That] have observed, the use of this phrase only perpetuates the vicious cycle of victim focus.” It may be true that it is beneficial to move away from negative terminology, and strive to take on “consent culture” as the new, more positive mantra. But in reality, what we have is a rape culture that is pervasive and malignant, and straightforward discussion of it should not be marginalized “out of fear of driving away the male demographic.”In simple terms, this is an overarching call to action. Discussion of sexual assault should not be limited to groups with one gender identity, should not pander to any particular demographic and should not stop just because we’ve gone a few days without another crime report in our inbox.Theda is a sophomore creative writing major with a certificate in graphic design.

""I want to state unambiguously that every student has the right to be safe. Sexual violence and misconduct are unacceptable.""The Association of American Universities Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault Climate Survey was administered last spring to 27 institutions across the country, partly in response to a call to action from the White House to protect students from sexual assault.At Monday’s conference, UW-Madison administration revealed, based on the survey results, that one in four female undergraduates has experienced sexual assault, but that very few of those are reported.Since January 2015, the university has received 136 reports of sexual assault, while the UW-Madison Police Department has only received six, UWPD Chief Susan Riseling said.Blank said the university is discussing adding a “second dose” of “Tonight,” an online prevention program used to inform incoming freshmen and transfer students on sexual assault and campus climate.Panel speakers at the conference highlighted education and outreach programs on campus that are meant to combat sexual violence. Some students, however, disagreed with the extent to which these programs make a difference.Sophomore Rachel Becker said she applauded UWPD’s “Don’t Be That Guy” campaign posters for targeting perpetrators, but thought their focus was too narrow.“I don’t know that targeting guys specifically as a gender is a good way of going about it,” Becker said. “There should be more promotion of the way guys should be as opposed to the way guys shouldn’t be in regards to how they treat women sexually and socially in general.”Students also play an important role in addressing issues of sexual violence, UW-Madison graduate student Valyncia Raphael said, which is why a new student Title IX Advisory Committee will launch next month. Students on the committee will help define federal and UW System-wide guidelines for dealing with sexual assault.“We need to work together with the administration to protect the Badger experience through continued student activism,” Raphael said.She added the committee will also encourage discourse and teamwork between students and administrators, creating a forum to “break the silence” across a larger community.“Ending sexual violence is a community responsibility,” Raphael said. “Action will take collaboration.”",Sexual assault survey results push administration to improve procedures,UWM

Chris Taylor, D-Madison, said. “Every nine seconds a woman is beaten and abused in the United States, every 90 seconds a woman is raped. That’s unacceptable. We’re here to say tonight, we don’t accept it.”People who participated in the march placed signs along the Capital City Bike Path in protest of sexual assault, portraying their anger for the community to see.Speakers also addressed inequality, self defense and everyday actions people can take to help end sexual violence. Ali Treviño-Murphy, an instructor at Villari’s Martial Arts and Fitness, stressed the importance of stepping up and fighting back against the problem.“When women … fight back, they are effective in preventing sexual assault 80 percent or more of the time,” Treviño-Murphy said. “Women are strong, physically, emotionally and mentally. Women survive every day. We survive sexism, we survive being disrespected, we survive on less pay … We fight every single day.”Volunteers from the Marquette Neighborhood Association collected donations for the survivor before the event.“Someone should be able to focus on their recovery and not on paying their rent … It’s just a little thing to do,” Renee Lauber, a member of the Marquette Neighborhood Association, said.According to Long, donations had neared $7,000 at the beginning of the march.“I’m so blown away by the outpouring of support from the community … and their willingness to take to the streets,” Long said. “And on the other hand, I’m so sick of feeling sick about violence against women. Enough is enough.”",Madison community marches in solidarity with sexual assault survivor,UWM

A year after taking my nervous first steps onto this campus, I’m still trying to wrap my head around how, in all my hours of research and determination on what university would be my home for the next four years, I skipped over this glaring detail. I got caught up in the trees of fantastic programs such as student research, Badger athletic programs, and the Wisconsin Idea, that I failed to notice the actual forest of student life on campus. Within this year, I continue to struggle reconciling my perceived image of Wisconsin and what it actually wound up being like, as well as reconciling scholastics and the heavy social aspect on here on campus.Plenty of people call Wisconsin a “work hard, play hard” type of school. To ignore the obvious connotations of drinking that statement carries with it is folly. However, the faces of our administration like to maintain a public stance of blissful ignorance to the fact that alcohol is so prevalent on our campus. Very rarely, if ever have I felt that the topics of underage drinking tickets, trips to detox, how many sexual assaults involve alcohol, and more, have been addressed with any substance or chutzpah. While press conferences from the top down would help set goals and directions for our student body, a grassroots movement could provide students the level of involvement that is difficult to see when looking at the chancellor or the Board of Regents. Wisconsin’s foremost student ambassadors are its athletes, student leadership and employees, and it’s high time for them to take responsibility for reflecting well upon our school and the student body as a whole. They are the bridge between the suits, the educational institution, and those who learn from it.What does it look like when an athlete has a drinking ticket and is allowed to stay on their team with little to no repercussions? How is the image of the average Wisconsin student affected when a sexual assault or other scandal is committed by someone we thought we could trust to represent the Badgers? Regardless of who does it, every one of these incidents detracts from our image as a whole; when executed by those we have chosen to represent our school, everyone’s image suffers.I wouldn’t dream of enacting some kind of nightmarish vision of Puritan moral values and have our athletes act as some kind of puppets to preach to our students on the importance of abstaining from alcohol and other unsavory behaviors. What we need is for the men and women who represent us on the field, in the media and behind the scenes to hold themselves to a higher standard. We must strike a balance between being tolerant of the urges to have (too) good of a time going out on a weekend night with that of proving that our athletes are professionals, and integral pillars of moral values to our student community.When our athletes, ASM representatives, student workers, and everyone else that wears the Motion W as a representative of this school polices themselves and how they act, their behavior unifies the campus by looking towards the example set by them. A rising tide lifts all ships, and in the moralistic aspect, let these ambassadors to the university be our vessels.Sergey is an sophomore majoring in international studies and economics.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/09/considering-sexual-assault-an-odyssey,"September 8, 2015 | 7:34pm CDT","All I wanted was a bunch of cheap tacos. That’s why I went to Chaser’s that night. Not to get drunk, not even to have fun, just for mildly good, cheap food. And up until right before I walked out I was successful in that endeavor. But then he did it. Some guy who I will never know, never be able to confront, never be able to pick out of a crowd, grabbed my girlfriend’s butt. I became immediately anxious, confused and enraged, unsure of where my emotions were or where they were taking me. I looked to her and yelled, “Who did this?” The bar, however, was too crowded for even her to identify the man who had violated her. Probably prompted by the look of shock on my face, she leaned in and said, over the noise, “this kind of stuff happens all the time.”I had no idea what to say to her. In that moment, am I supposed to strictly comfort her? Am I on the hook for apologizing on behalf of my gender? I didn’t know, so I didn’t say much. All I could think of were the countless times I had told her that I would always protect her and that I had ultimately broken that promise that night.As I calmed down later, though, my mind came back to the last thing she said while we were in the bar. That college-aged men sexually assaulting young women wasn’t just a problem we hear about on the news and, more and more frequently, in our Wiscmail inbox, but a common occurrence. Beyond that, I began to think of all the times I had heard men my age make sexually degrading “jokes.” This was, of course, something that I was aware of before, but I became sick thinking that it took something like this for me to put it in the correct context: to view it in a personal light.This campus has been wrestling with the problem of sexual assault for many years. The volume of this conversation has increased recently with the publication of articles in campus newspapers denying the existence of rape culture and with controversies surrounding victim shaming on sexual assault notification emails from UW Police and the administration. But for me, that’s all it’s been: a conversation.Now, I am coming at this from a perspective of an individual that belongs to a group that, historically, has not had to worry about sexual assault or sexual violence being committed against them. So, I realize that this issue has been much more than a conversation to many people on this campus and around the world. But in case you haven’t noticed, the perspective that I am coming from, that of a white, heterosexual male, is a pretty common one at UW-Madison.I was struck thinking about what little thought many of the members of this group have probably given to sexual assault, let alone enough to personalize it. Sexual assault is one of the most pressing issues facing our student body right now. It is something that affects all students in one way or another, so all students should take the time to care about it.It is certainly the responsibility of the university to take a more active role in combatting this. However, at the end of the day sexual assault will still remain one of the most difficult crimes to prove. As a result of this, the onus is on us, the students, to take a stand. Look out for each other, and take it personally when someone does something this atrocious. Do your best to make sure that person is punished. Because even if you have never been the victim of sexual assault, if you are a student on this campus, as unfortunate as this sounds, you probably know and care about someone who has.So, to the guy who grabbed my girlfriend’s butt at Chaser’s: you are a vile, disgusting human being who should be held accountable for denying young women on this campus the opportunity to be comfortable while they are trying to have fun with their friends. You are a disgrace to this university and to this community. But I don’t even know who you are. So, all I can do is hope and pray that if you ever do something like that again, an onlooker takes it personally enough to identify you and give your victims the justice they deserve.Max is a senior majoring in political science and pursuing a certificate in educational policy studies.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/05/our-editorial-board-staff-looks-ahead,N/A,"As the school year comes to a close, members of our Editorial Board sound off in a series of blurbs on issues in which they’d like to see progress. Soglin and HomelessnessIf you are to believe Mayor Paul Soglin’s words, residents of Madison are losing control of the city to the rising number of homeless individuals throughout downtown. Mayor Soglin’s laughable, extreme two-page memo laying out how to deal with the “crisis” facing Madison shows his stark misunderstanding of how to handle an increase in poor and homeless individuals. If the mayor wants to solve this problem, bring downtown business leaders, homeless individuals and city leaders to the table and hash out drug counseling and city-run food distribution, instead of limiting how long someone can sit on a bench. Come on, Mayor Soglin, you’re smarter than this.—Conor MurphyWalker's BudgetWhen Gov. Scott Walker released his budget Feb. 2, he put statewide higher education in a bind. The Board of Regents would get its autonomy from the state, but at the price of a $300 million budget cut spread over two years. To add insult to injury, he proposed erasing the Wisconsin Idea, the very cornerstone of education at the University of Wisconsin, for a more workforce-centered mission. Then, he balked on the change, calling it a “drafting error.” Those decisions, coupled with others to shear away money from K-12 education, begs the question of who the governor is trying impress. As budget discussions play out over the summer, it should become clear it’s not the people trying to get educated in his home state.—Jack CaseyWalker's out-of-state timeFor a man who won three gubernatorial elections in four years, Gov. Scott Walker sure loves to leave Wisconsin lately. Between Jan. 1 and April 26, Walker spent 56 out of 115 days outside the state. Despite releasing a contentious biennial budget that will affect the lives of all Wisconsinites, Walker has decided his time is best spent traveling across America and Europe promoting himself as a worthy Republican candidate for president. Walker has forgotten his duty to the people of Wisconsin in favor of political grandstanding, a decision that has, and will continue to have, dire consequences for the people of Wisconsin.—Cullen VossUW's sexual assault policyConversation surrounding sexual assaults at UW-Madison used to be background noise to students and faculty alike, hanging over campus like the buzz of traffic on University Avenue. This past academic year, however, that dialogue blared over the city like the Helen C. White steam whistle. But while organizations like PAVE have been proactive in organizing programs to support victims and promoting assault prevention and awareness, other prominent groups have stumbled: Last fall, the Madison Police Department sent out an email with tips to prevent assaults that was virtually victim-blaming, and this spring, a federal investigation was launched into numerous universities’ (including UW-Madison’s) possible mishandlings of sexual assaults. In future academic terms, we have high expectations for universities to provide stronger support for victims, abandon victim-blaming language and be more aggressive in their training for new students in order to extinguish the epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses.—Haley HenschelThe Hub and State StreetAs the Hub nears completion, it is looking less like its shiny, streamlined preconstruction visual renderings than it is a Witte with a few extra windows. If the Hub 2 ends up being built, Madison will finally have East Campus dorms for young professionals.I don’t mean to be too critical of the Hub complex itself. Just because luxurious amenities don’t appeal to me doesn’t mean there’s no demand for them. However, making State Street and the downtown area more exclusive, with high-end rent and retail, will only serve to further divide the Madison community along socioeconomic lines.—Andy HolsteenImproving Diversity InitiativesTo effectively prepare students for an increasingly diverse country, UW-Madison needs to move beyond discussion and strengthen diversity and inclusion.In efforts to do just that, shared governance groups brought forward the Diversity Framework.However, instead of holding more and more vague discussions to receive “input” despite supposedly being in the plan’s implementation process, it is time to see action. This includes a clearer budget and the materialization of proposed new and enhanced programs.It is concerning that this process began with a different chancellor, chief diversity officer and provost than we currently have, potentially leaving gaps in ideologies and priorities. Although they are giving the same pro-diversity rhetoric, there does not appear to be the same level of attention and expertise.No, the state Legislature’s budget cuts are not an acceptable excuse for the administration’s lackadaisical approach.Until we stop hearing people shout the n-word at students of color on the street and referring to groups of “Asians” as if they’re one collective horde, students are not learning how to live in a diverse country.—Jonah BeleckisUnion coffee“Whoa, just another lonely night/ Are you willing to sacrifice your life?” Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon roars these words in the opening lines of Kanye West’s “Monster.” These lyrics can be likened to our Editorial Board members’ experiences with Union coffee: Often desperately consumed in our most desolate, vulnerable states—in the midst of a lengthy study session or all-nighter—drinking Union coffee forces one to choose between procuring a caffeinated buzz and betraying their taste buds/dignity. I, for one, am not entirely convinced it’s actually coffee grounds in there—maybe a used napkin from Coffeebytes’ dumpster mixed with a stale dog turd, plus a pinch of dirt and/or vomit scraped from the floor of a Witte bathroom? Seriously, Wisconsin Unions, I used to work at Pizza Hut and THEIR coffee is better than yours. For the sake of future Badgers, we implore you to change your java formula.—Haley HenschelWhy 'Black Lives Matter'The above statement should trigger you to understand why clarification is even necessary. These protests symbolize a pivotal moment in the history of our campus—let alone our country in a global context—yet the university has barely recognized these efforts at all, despite the long history of UW-Madison’s protesting and social awareness during times like Vietnam or Libya. This is an ongoing saga chronicling the experiences of black and brown bodies with narratives that our oppressive society will take every conceivable means of silencing.Our neighbors, the cops that walk among us, the citizens you may never know… have the potential to end one of our lives and walk free.How can a Badger like you get involved? Take the time to educate yourself on the issues. Interface with community and campus organizations dedicated to constructive dialoguing and programming around the movement. Furthermore, do not limit your involvement to this moment. The efforts on this campus are neither the beginning nor the end of this struggle.No matter your alignment on the political spectrum, respect the fact that black and brown human beings—rich, middle-class, poor, straight, queer, transgendered, people with mental wellness challenges, people with disabilities, people with degrees from this very university and a myriad of others I haven’t named—are living in danger of dying if they have not been exterminated already.And that is unacceptable.—Michael Penn IISend all comments to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Our Editorial Board staff looks ahead,UWM

Police officer shoots Tony Robinson following altercation Madison Police Officer Matt Kenny shot and killed 19-year-old Tony Robinson in a family home on Williamson Street in March, sparking months of protest and calls for Kenny’s arrest.When community members learned of the shooting, a crowd gathered at the scene, where police had shut down the block of Williamson Street on which the shooting occurred.Robinson’s grandmother, Sharon Irwin, appeared before the crowd to ask that protests continue, but continue peacefully.In the following months, the Young, Gifted & Black coalition and other groups marched and rallied at the state Capitol, the City County Building and other locations around Madison, sometimes shutting down streets as they called for Kenny’s indictment.Madison Police Chief Mike Koval wrote a letter to city alders as the protests continued, demanding they show more support of city law enforcement.After the state Department of Justice completed an investigation into the matter, the department submitted its report to Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne to determine whether to bring criminal charges against Kenny.Ozanne has not announced a decision yet but said he would give the public 48-hour notice before he does.-Andrew Hahn2. Gov. Scott Walker proposes state budgetGov. Scott Walker proposed a state budget Jan. 27 that would place a $300 million budget cut on the UW System and reorder it under a public authority model.This public authority model would grant the Board of Regents the autonomy to set policy that would otherwise need approval from the Legislature and remove shared governance from state statute.UW-Madison is preparing to carry $96 million of the system-wide cuts, which Chancellor Rebecca Blank said will come from all campus departments and nonresident tuition increases.Blank also said in an April 17 online post that 400 university positions will be eliminated, several programs will be closed or merged and less money will be budgeted toward maintaining buildings on campus.Students can expect larger class sizes with fewer course options and a reduction in advising services, which Blank said could hurt both the time students take to graduate and retention.2014-’15 Associated Students of Madison Chair Gen Carter said she expects the Board of Regents to create a new policy to replace shared governance upon its potential removal.Walker’s proposal removed phrases from the Wisconsin Idea, the system’s commitment to serving the greater good of the state. He later reinserted the idea, calling it a “drafting error.”-Ellie Herman3. Nonresident, graduate school tuition increasesNonresident tuition will increase for UW-Madison students starting Fall 2015, after the Board of Regents approved the first two years of the university’s plan at an April 3 meeting.Out-of-state tuition is set to increase $6,000 by the 2016-’17 school year, bringing it to $31,523. International undergraduate cost will be raised $7,000 within two years to $32,523.Various graduate school programs, such as the School of Business, will face a 9.8 percent tuition increase to all programs.In-state tuition is not set to increase, due to a previous tuition freeze by Gov. Scott Walker.UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank said in an online post she is “confident” the nonresident tuition increases will not hurt the university’s ability to attract new students.2014-’15 Associated Students of Madison Vice Chair Derek Field said Wisconsin has “long prided” itself for its affordability within the Big Ten conference.-Ellie Herman4. Gov. Scott Walker makes presidential movesGov. Scott Walker won the attention of the state and the nation by organizing committees and trips abroad that left many wondering if they were preludes to a run at the 2016 presidential nomination.In January Walker began what would become a series of speeches in Iowa, sharing stages with other rumored presidential hopefuls like U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Walker also hired staff to open offices in early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire.Walker spent much of the spring abroad, making trips to England, Spain and other countries to talk with world leaders about economic policy.An April poll conducted by the Marquette University Law School found Walker leading among other Republicans in his home state, but trailing declared Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by nine points in a possible matchup.-Andrew Hahn5. Republicans expedite passage of right-to-work billChaotic public hearings, a 24-hour floor debate and numerous protests could not stop the right-to-work bill from becoming law, as Gov. Scott Walker signed the controversial bill March 9.Republican leaders introduced the bill, which prohibits making union membership a condition of employment, in late February during an extraordinary session of the Legislature.Their actions set the stage for a contentious public hearing in the Senate, with the committee approving the measure as the room erupted into chaos following a decision to end the hearing early.The full Senate passed the bill the next day, sending it to the Assembly for its approval. That body needed 24 hours of debate and despite the repeated pleas of Democratic lawmakers, they too voted to send the bill to Walker’s desk.Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said the bill’s passage was a victory for the freedom of Wisconsin workers.-Andrew Bahl6. Soglin keeps mayoral titleMayor Paul Soglin gained more than 70 percent of votes and retained his title in a race against former Ald. Scott Resnick, District 8, in the 2015 spring elections.Soglin and Resnick won with 52.7 and 23.3 percent of the vote, respectively, against three challengers in the February 17 primary election.About an hour after polls closed April 7 and Resnick conceded the race, Soglin reaffirmed his reasons for running.“I made a commitment four years ago,” Soglin said to his supporters. “I couldn’t live with myself if I abandoned issues where I tried to get the city focused, [like] poverty [and] dealing with equity. ... We are going to continue to lead.”Community members recently protested for action addressing the core causes of homelessness after Soglin released a letter about ending homelessness. He called for not allowing people to sleep in the State Street and Capitol Square area, something he did not address during his re-election campaign. -Dana Kampa7. YGB protests Dane County jail renovationsAs Dane County Board supervisors dug deeper into plans to renovate the Dane County jail early this year, the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition directed its efforts at stopping the proposals in protest of the perpetuated racial disparities the group said the jail creates.YGB organized protests, debates and discussions during the past months to bring current jail conditions to light, arguing no money should be spent before the prison releases 350 inmates. Members cited data from the 2013 Race to Equity report, which exposed disproportionate incarceration rates between African-American and white populations in Dane County.Concurrently, renovation supporters like Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney argued during a debate with YGB in March the renovations would improve conditions inside the jail.Sponsors on the Dane County Board proposed a resolution targeting solitary confinement, mental health and structural problems with the jail itself in February, which Dane County’s finance committee postponed a decision on late April after hearing much public dissent.-Laura Grulke 8.

State enacts regulations for Uber, LyftStudents who use rideshare companies such as Uber or Lyft can rejoice, as a bill regulating those businesses at the statewide level passed the state Legislature in April and was signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker.The bill would require the popular services to carry liability insurance, pay a licensing fee every two years and conduct background checks on drivers. It would also supercede local regulations, overruling ordinances in Madison that effectively ban the services.Days before Walker signed the bill, two women reported being sexually assaulted by different Uber drivers. Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, a longtime critic of rideshare companies, accused Uber of “stonewalling” investigations into the incidents.Bill co-author state Rep. Tyler August, R-Lake Geneva, said the measure provides a boost to the state’s economy.“[The bill] encourages companies to move here and, by setting statewide standards, there is certainty for these companies,” August said before the bill passed the state Assembly.-Andrew Bahl10. SLAC protests university relationship with JanSportThe Student Labor Action Coalition held protests throughout the semester against the university's affiliation with JanSport, a subsidiary of the garment conglomerate VF Corporation.Protests varied in method—including demonstrators wearing signs instead of UW apparel, an art piece made of shirts and a talk by a Rana Plaza collapse survivor—with the goal of urging VF Corporation to sign the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh.While the corporation was a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, SLAC claims the Alliance is less accountable than the Accord.In an April 24 letter, Chancellor Rebecca Blank reaffirmed her decision not to terminate the university’s relationship with JanSport. While other universities have cut ties with VF Corporation, Blank stressed that JanSport does not have control over the documents and does not produce in Bangladesh.SLAC members said they plan to continue protesting until VF signs the Accord or the university cuts ties with JanSport.-Miller Jozwiak ",Top 10 News: Spring Semester 2015,UWM

Uber uses records dating back seven years in accordance with national regulatory legislation. Their website specifically highlights employing drivers with “no sexual offenses.”“The three-step screening [Uber has] developed across the United States, which includes county, federal and multi-state checks, has set a new standard,” according to the Uber website.Eleven Dane County representatives echoed Soglin’s concerns by writing a letter Tuesday to Gov. Scott Walker, urging him to veto a proposed bill about transportation network companies that fail to provide information on driver and vehicle identity.The proposed bill aims to expand companies like Uber by restricting municipalities from regulating them.In comparison, state standards for licensed taxi companies require the state to know the identity of the driver, have background checks of the driver, vehicle registration and the driver’s home address.“Had this incident occurred in a licensed taxicab, driver information would have been immediately available,” the Dane County legislators wrote.Soglin stressed the importance of local government cooperation with the state level in hopes of Walker doing “the right thing” and vetoing the bill.","Soglin, Dane County legislators call for Uber reform amid sexual assault allegations",UWM

These are the words that choke the media of today. All we see is naked ladies and their genitals spread open cross the magazine covers. With this said, what is the difference between commercialized pornography and the sexualized material we view at bus stops, on television, in magazines, or in movies?I don’t know what to think about strippers, prostitutes, exotic dancers, or the women who work in Gentlemen’s Clubs. I don’t know what to think about pornography itself. I have this innate feeling that these women are so much more than the curved reflections of their bodies. I completely understand and support bodily autonomy. What one decides to do with their body is entirely in their control. As a woman, however, I cannot imagine myself in pornography? performing, more or less, for the benefit of others. Personally, this type of work appears degrading. If these women really enjoyed pleasuring strangers with their bodies, then I would tell them to go for it. If there are women in this world who receive physical, mental, or emotional satisfaction from working as a sexworker, stripper, or an adult film star then I am glad they found their calling. However, most women do not. They “do it for the money.” In the documentary Nude Girls Live , a woman responded to the question, what do you think about when you’re working , with “bills, things I have yet to do, my body.” When asked how it is working as a sexworker, another woman responded, “It gets boring.” The woman selling herself is not enjoying it. She is just enduring it? tolerating it.Mostly to blame is our society, which condones misogynistic ideas found in media. Young minds absorb these visualizations. For some women, these norms make choosing this sort of lifestyle (pornography, stripping, etc.) a lot easier and quicker. They are normalized to seeing women in these positions.All the stereotypes and violence that exist towards women especially towards female sex workers is another compounding factor. A sex worker is automatically questioned and judged, and often thought of as an occupant of the “bottom of the totem pole.” They are seen as prey rather than a predator. Furthermore, as much as I’d like to believe that women thoroughly enjoy it, I just don’t. I think they often serve their customers without benefits, and do so regardless of safe spaces or conditions.Whether physical, verbal, psychological, interpersonal, or institutional: violence towards women can happen anywhere at any time and in any occupation. Women always have to “watch their back,” but it is even worse for the women whose backs are naked. Furthermore, if someone argues that pornography, stripping, or sexwork promotes “sex positivity” (a movement that encourages a healthy outlook on consensual sex), I have to stand against that idea. I do, however, individually stand for “sex positivity” full heartedly. But, in a society that condones sending girls home because “their outfits are distracting boys?” or trivializing sexual assault with photo memes? manufacturing decals for cars of helpless, bound up women in order to see whether or not people would notice? and then having decal orders increase as a result of this sort of promotion (Terkel, Huffington Post) is simply morally unjust.Sex is great – mentally, emotionally, and physically beneficial – but only when it is done consensually, confidently, and consciously. However, until men, as well as the rest of society, can create an environment in which people of all sexual identities feel that gender inequality no longer exists, I do not think work that submits women to sell themselves and their identity should be supported. Saying that “porn is good” or “sex work was the only choice left” may encourage misogynistic tendencies. Women are not just flesh. Society needs to redefine the existing attitudes toward women, the oppressed, and sex in general.Send all comments to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Letter to the Editor: Porn contributes to gender stereotypes,UWM

Mark Pocan, D-Wis., U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the group lobbied for issues such as simplifying the Free Application for Federal Student Aid while opposing federal Pell Grants and subsidized loan freezes.Jungers said most offices supported their efforts but could not give a definitive answer as to whether bills to freeze subsidized loans and pell grants will pass. Some, like Ryan’s office, remain in support of freezing or eliminating subsidized loans completely.Legislative Affairs Chair Tom Gierok said the lack of initial profit may be a factor in Ryan’s opposition to these kinds of loans. Because they do not begin to accumulate interest until the borrower graduates, the loans may disrupt an ideal balanced budget.The group also discussed issues and initiatives concerning sexual assault while in Washington, though legislators are currently only working on one bill that would give grants for educating K-12 students on healthy relationships.Gierok said knowledgeable stakeholders need to be involved before any meaningful legislation can be passed in Wisconsin to deal with sexual assault in higher education. Though ASM is adamant on advancing this effort, specialized groups on campus must engage with the process, Gierok said.Tackling issues at a federal level can be hard for college students, but Gierok said the conference provided an opportunity for their concerns to be heard, which is especially important when having discussions that directly affect students.“With every single policy that we came across, it was common that there was no student voice in any of the discussions,” Gierok said. “We all had a really good chance to engage with them [at the conference].”",Students ensure their voices are heard in nation’s legislative process,UWM

UW-Madison previously formed its own misconduct procedures in August.Students suggest adding three categories to the definition of misconduct of Chapter 17 to the faculty, including dating violence, domestic violence and sexual assault.Currently, respondents can appeal decisions made by the misconduct panel, but complainants cannot. The Division of Student Life proposed a change so both the complainant and respondent have equal rights when challenging or appealing to the misconduct panel.The proposed addition to Chapter 17 would also ensure that both the complainant and respondent have the choice to discuss the offense with either the misconduct panel or to keep it between the police department.Additionally, both students and Division of Student Life staff propose keeping at least one student on the misconduct panel, as other universities in the UW System want to remove student participation altogether, ASM Chair Gen Carter said.“Currently the sexual misconduct panels are made up of three people, and one of them is a student,” Carter said. “I think what our administration has been advocating for, and certainly what students have been advocating for, is to keep it so that there would be a student on these misconduct panels.”The Division of Student Life representatives recognized the potential backlash to some of these potential changes.“There’s been consistency with one person in their sanctioning. When we go to the panels, even though [the students] are trained, they are average people from our campus community, and they could make decisions all over the board,” Assistant Dean of Students Tonya Schmidt said.Council members raised potential issues of privacy, as students involved in sexual misconduct cases may worry about details of the incident spreading if students sit on the panel.However, Schmidt said the required annual training for panel members could negate this problem.UW-Madison will gather responses from students regarding the changes to Chapter 17 and report back to the UW System, where it would be approved by the Board of Regents.“Being codified by law adds an element of gravitas to it, but it also makes changing it an act of the legislature,” Associate Dean of Students Kevin Helmkamp said. “So, changes that are proposed have a complex process to go through.”Correction: Several language changes were made to reflect that changes to the policy originated from the UW-System, rather than UW-Madison.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/03/new-season-of-house-of-cards-is-a-dud,"March 11, 2015 | 8:52pm CDT","Like most everything else, television is all about relationships. From “The Sopranos” to “Community,” all great shows use personal relationships as a fulcrum to lift up the rest of the plot around them. However, when shows (especially dramas) forgot about the world outside of a marriage or a friendship, when things turn inward just a little bit too much, your show starts to suck.In a vacuum, there isn’t that much writers can do with relationships that hasn’t already been done or isn’t an inherent part of the human experience. You can write a marriage well, and you can make it seem real, but nobody can transform it well enough that it’s all anybody wants to see. That, in a nutshell, is what ruins “House of Cards.”Now, just to warn you, I haven’t really liked anything “House of Cards” has thrown at me this side of the season two premiere. I thought the second season was too easy, President Walker couldn’t even manage a Jamba Juice and certainly wasn’t a convincing president. The third season suffered from an opposite problem; it just seemed too hard, and much of that had to do with the changing dynamics in Frank and Claire Underwood’s marriage.Instead of moving the two strong characters we knew from previous seasons into the Oval Office, we get two weak, distilled versions of them. All of the sudden, Frank is indecisive and ineffectual; he can’t even keep control of his own party, much less the stereotypical Russian president he’s set up against. Yet, Claire is now a puppet to this weak husband’s will, a completely hollowed out woman that can’t even be pitied.This is the innate tragedy of the new season. Claire Underwood was once a platform for the exploration of volatile social issues; there was the abortion arc in season one, and the frank discussion of sexual assault both at the university and military levels was easily one of the show’s most brilliant moments.Now, with her as the First Lady, the writers had the chance to use Claire as an even more powerful advocate for change. She would never have as much individual power as she does as First Lady, and the anticipation for season three was such that the show had never been so popular. Instead, she fails in spectacular fashion as a UN ambassador, and we get Jackie Sharp using women’s rights as a weapon against the bland Heather Dunbar. It’s confusing that a show normally so vocal about current American issues would use something as important as women’s rights in such a crass manner.Yet, at its heart, this is a show about Frank Underwood, and most of the problems stem from him. Frank was a shark; maybe not the biggest fish in the pond, but definitely the most dangerous. Well, this shark lost all of his teeth. Frank grows a heart and loses the ability to instill fear, and the two things that made him fun were his complete lack of morals and his ability to instill fear.So…. not great. This is also the season where we see Frank Underwood cry, which is about as awkward as last year’s Meachum threesome.

Scott Walker and UW System officials came briefly under fire Friday after a nonpartisan analysis of Walker’s recent budget proposal showed it deletes one of the reporting methods for sexual assaults on UW campuses required under current state law.Current law requires the System’s Board of Regents to submit an annual report to the state Legislature to prove its campuses are including information about sexual assault in their orientation programs for new students. It also requires that any UW employee who witnesses or hears about a sexual assault on campus to report it to the school’s dean of students. The budget proposal would remove these obligations from state statute.A spokesperson for Walker said Friday the provisions were included in the proposal at the request of System officials involved in budget negotiations, the Associated Press reported.“They allow us to focus on one report,” said UW System spokesperson Heather LaRoi in an email Friday. “Many requirements proposed for removal from state statutes are duplicative of federal requirements and reporting standards we comply with and are deeply committed to, such as those within The Clery Act and Title IX.”The analysis of the budget proposal also found the budget deletes shared governance protections, as expected under the public authority model for the UW System.Tom Gierok, chair of the Associated Students of Madison’s Legislative Affairs Committee, said last month the shared governance changes would mean students lose their say in the decisions of their respective universities.Requirements to maintain the minority student scholarship programs, like the Lawton Undergraduate Minority Retention Grant and the Advanced Opportunity Fellowship program, would also be deleted by the budget if it passes in its current form.UW System officials will appear before the Legislature’s budget committee Tuesday to testify about what the $300 million cut and public authority model will mean for the state’s universities over the next biennium.","Assault reporting, shared governance face deletions in state budget",UWM

Our guitarist called out for the help of one of the owners of the house, who first had to wade through several dozen sweaty bodies before he could assess the situation. I grew more anxious with every unsuccessful utterance of “check” into the microphones. It was our first DIY show in Madison, and a basement filled to the brim with anticipating eyes was watching us struggle to get our equipment working. It goes without saying that an entire concert taking place in the basement of a house is going to have a few kinks to work out. I had to tiptoe to my drumset as to not disturb any of the cables that were scattered across the floor. But that’s the charm of the Spanish Mansion, a concert space situated in a house with an undisclosed address. The operation is run primarily by The Great Duck War, a band which has members currently living in the Spanish Mansion, or SpanMan for short as they like to call it. The shows are semi-exclusive events, available to those who know the right places to snoop around for the address. Our band, Trophy Dad, was excited for the gig, so we handed out the address like sexual health groups hand out condoms on Valentine’s Day. In a basement that, at absolute maximum capacity, can hold about fifty people, you have to suppress attendance so that your fans aren’t hearing you while standing from the staircase of a neighboring hallway.The basement had risen to sauna-level temperatures as we finally got the mics on. I could see the sweat on crowd member’s faces as they eagerly awaited our first musical notes. It was clear that nobody came to this show to be comfortable, and that’s exactly where the charm in DIY shows lies. It’s the beautiful union of concert and party, where people can wild out for the weekend while maintaining their artistic integrity. I was already leaving quite the sweat stain on my drum stool, and the moment it was time to count off our first song I spilled all of the pent-up energy of pre-show anxiousness onto the drum kit. Just because we weren’t playing at an official venue didn’t mean that the show would be easy to play. Given how congested having fifty-something people in a room, coupled with the unbearable heat given off by dancing bodies, I had difficulty combatting lightheadedness as we went from song to song. There was no border between band and audience except for the thin metal bar that separated carpet from linoleum tile. “It felt a lot more intimate knowing that we were dancing and being as much of a part of the show as the band was, as oppose to just watching them from a stage,” Darcy Kerrigan described about her experience at SpanMan. The feeling’s mutual from one of my band mate’s perspective. Watching our guitarist crossing over the carpet border and parading into the bulging crowd while maintaining tempo made me fully understand how interconnected everyone was.Even when practicing in the same space a week before, there was no way for me to predict how the performance would go. The energy the crowd gave off was as important to the show as rehearsing our songs was. Due to the audience members unquenchable desire to mosh, our song, which sounds like a dreamy Real Estate tune in practice, transformed into a no-brakes, punk freak-out in reality. By the time we ended our opening set for The Great Duck War, all of my senses had been assaulted in some way or another. I was hot, I could smell my armpits from a foot away, the taste of cheap, lukewarm beer dripped off my mouth and my ears were ringing from a combination of drum hits, unintentional mic feedback and the screaming crowd into which we just threw our heart and soul. I had no time to shake the congratulatory hands of friends approaching me—not that anyone would have wanted to embrace my dripping body. My only directive was to escape the heat-trap of our show, and to burst out onto the outdoor porch of SpanMan. After the show, any degree below zero felt like room temperature to me. I stepped outside in just jeans and a T-shirt, most likely triggering an instinctive heart attack from my mother back in Chicago. There was such a massive trade-off of energy between band and audience that my circuits had fried. The basement show was a beast that had bested me, and the only thing I could think as we all piled into the basement for one last time that night was “I should’ve worn earplugs.”Have you fallen in love with heat trap-like, claustrophobic basement concerts or parties?

The best part about a single musician’s Valentine’s Day is that you can be sad anywhere! Just plug in your headphones and you can longingly wonder how your ex-girlfriend has been doing on the go! Singles’ activities on Valentine’s Day can be paired with music like cheese to a fine wine.I recommend pairing a lonesome nature walk with some thick, fuzzy shoegaze, something along the lines of “Loveless” by My Bloody Valentine. If you’re looking at pictures of that one time you and Nora baked cookies together (Nora, if you’re reading this, please come back we can make this work), I recommend some crisp Midwestern emo along the lines of American Football and their self-titled LP. It’s gonna be a lonely V-Day, so why don’t you plug in those noise-canceling headphones so you can stop pestering all those happy people in relationships?—Jake WitzTelevisionSingle on Valentine’s Day? Not to worry! I know a very special someone who would be more than willing to get to know you better (like, romantically). Its name is Netflix, and I think you two are going to get along great.Feeling the futility of love? Try “Luther,” Idris Elba’s BBC drama about a detective who very much feels that futility (and solves crimes to boot!). But maybe that’s not quite enough. You really want romantically entangled people to suck it. Well, your new lover Netflix has you there too. Watch “Broadchurch,” a show about how horrible it is to fall in love and have kids and then live through the murder of your youngest child.If that grim description didn’t turn you on, then you should probably just watch something happier. Like “Chuck” or “Friends” or something. You know, one of those shows where people like and trust each other. Just make sure you treat Netflix right—it’s a friend of mine. —Jake SmasalOnline MediaUsually on Valentine’s Day I like to send both my single and taken friends moderately inappropriate Valentine’s memes. Last year they were flappy bird themed and I was shocked to find so many. This year I stumbled upon three dozen—again I was very alarmed at the number—slightly more than moderately inappropriate Pixar Valentine’s Day memes.On Feb. 14, as I finish an extra-large black olive and extra cheese pizza, they will be penetrating my friends’ Facebook inboxes much to their dismay. Then for my own entertainment and emotional destruction I will be watching YouTube videos of the most elaborate and beautiful proposals and sobbing into said pizza as I realize just how forever alone I actually am.Although I will be alone on Hallmark’s holiday, at least the Internet will be there to comfort me with Netflix, semi-inappropriate e-cards and Lifetime movies. —Abbie RuckdashelQueer MediaValentine’s Day is a hop, skip and a jump away, and I honestly don’t care this year. Friends of mine lambast it as a capitalistic ploy for greeting card companies, while others think it’s a day for couples to prance around and show off that they’ve found a person with whom to have sex. For me as a gay man, it’s less about what other people, or scary corporations, are doing, but how I currently feel in the gay dating “scene.”“Modern Family” is—stereotypes aside—a fantastic example of a married gay couple and their relationships with family, friends and their children. But, I’m not going to hop on Grindr and find a man who will become a perfect husband. Then there’s “Looking,” HBO’s “Girls” for gays—they even share the lack of minority main characters! “Looking” tells me it’s okay to be in messy, complicated relationships, but then, in the season two promo, the show seemed to be promoting a “choice” for the main character between two men. We must have monogamy, the show says, but not without drama!Where’s the happy medium? These two shows aren’t alone, and they’re telling gay men they must either find a husband and settle down or screw whoever they want and then find someone for a long-term relationship. If I want to see relationships that reflect how I’m currently living, I’m going to turn to “Broad City,” where the main characters have varied sexual experiences that are new and fresh for themselves. Gay media—at least what I’ve been exposed to—needs to break away from the heteronormativity of long-term relationships. Otherwise, it will cease to reflect the men to which they’re marketing. All I know for this weekend is I’m going to marathon “Broad City” while spending time with the two men that really matter in my life: Ben & Jerry.—Conor Murphy",Art is the perfect Valentine for singles this holiday,UWM

If you watched Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday night, you might have seen the corny cartoon commercial for the JUBLIA toe fungus remover among other commercials. Along with half the population of the world, I watch the Super Bowl purely for the commercials. I love the ones that make me laugh and I love the ones that make me cry.Past themes of commercials have been sexualizing women, men’s fantasies and crude humor. Popular commercials of Super Bowl 2014 have been Axe “Make Love, Not War” and the Dannon John Stamos dream commercial. While these topics are interesting to comment on throughout the week following the Super Bowl, it seems as if the commercials have taken a different turn this year.The ads of Super Bowl XLIX were super depressing. Budweiser’s “Lost Dog” brought half the population to tears over a yellow lab puppy and Always’ “#LikeAGirl” made everyone rethink the meaning of the phrase “you run like a girl.” The real shocker was the Nationwide “Childhood Accidents” commercial which discussed the fact that most children die due to preventative accidents.The NFL even tried rehabilitating its own image with a spot on domestic violence. The league, which was criticized for its handling of player Ray Rice’s assault on his fiancée, aired a commercial featuring a terrified woman who calls 911 pretending to order out for pizza when she is really trying to convey to cops that she fears for her life. It seems as though companies are becoming more successful using emotional advertisements so people feel passionate about their product. For example, Toyota used the story of Paralympic medalist Amy Purdy to try to peddle its vehicles.With this turn from objectifying women to condemning domestic violence, one has to ask “Who woke up ad managers to what is really going on in the world?” When did ad campaigns realize that instead of promoting the newest quadruple cheeseburger what was really needed was a simple call to action to end obesity and eat healthier?There is no one reason why America has stopped caring about trivial things. Perhaps it is due to current celebrities taking a stand on important issues such as feminism, obesity, domestic violence, etc. Or perhaps it is because the ability people have to voice their opinions on issues through multiple social media platforms.While watching the Super Bowl on Sunday night, I expected tweets of disgust over how there was no crude humor or X-rated fantasy ads.  Instead many of my Twitter and Facebook friends were glad that companies had taken a stance on popular topics. Whether you watch the Super Bowl for the sports or for the commercials, there was something for everyone during the Super Bowl XLIX Sunday night.Lilly is a freshman writer for The Daily Cardinal.

Cook’s preliminary trial is set to take place Jan. 20, 2017.The request for special prosecutors to stand in the trial came due to the high profile nature of Cook’s case, rather than any conflict of interest with the office, according to the letter.The letter, sent by Dane County Deputy District Attorney Mary Ellen Karst, said the attorneys general would bring sophistication to Cook’s “high-profile multiple victim sexual assault” case, which has received national attention.Skwierawski and Viste will assist the case’s leading prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Colette Sampson.Skwierawski, who also serves as Wisconsin’s Violence Against Women resource prosecutor, has a background in sexual assault and stalking cases around the state, according to the attorney general office’s website.Viste, assistant attorney general since 2015, pressed for increased bail at Cook’s Dec. 16 bail hearing, where a county judge cut monetary requirements in half to $100,000, allowing his parents to post bail that same day.",Two special prosecutors appointed to Cook case,UWM

Their efforts were fruitful and noticed.Making sure students were registered was crucial, as many UW-Madison students moved this year and had to re-register at their new address. Every member of ASM’s Student Council was trained to register students, which garnered approximately 3,400 student voter registrations, according to ASM Vote Coordinator Billy Welsh.In Wisconsin, a photo voter ID is required at polling places. For those who do not have a Wisconsin driver’s license or government ID, an additional form of photo ID is required. This requirement is not met by student ID cards, so many nonresident students were tasked with acquiring separate voter IDs. ASM made a concerted effort to set up voter ID machines at every polling place on campus to aid students in their preparation.Furthermore, ASM successfully lobbied to provide not one but two early voting places on campus. Early voting returns from Union South and the Student Activity Center on East Campus Mall showed that about 4,000 early ballots were cast at each location.Students are generally a demographic whose voter turnout is low. UW-Madison’s ASM served its student body well, while substantially increasing student voting accessibility.Campus community responds to results of presidential electionThe election of Donald Trump brought a justifiable fervor of fear to our campus. The number of bias incidents on campus spiked in the week following the election alone. But something else was present: powerful acts of student solidarity and activism in the face of hate.The night following the election, the streets rang with voices of students protesting against sexual assault and rape culture present in our school, our nation and now embodied by the words and actions of the president-elect.The next night, over 2,000 students, faculty and community members marched to the Capitol with their voices at full volume. Upon arrival, they laid down on the lawn for a “die-in” in solidarity with historically marginalized groups who now have to stare hate in the face as it’s sworn into the White House.Additionally, the Muslim Student Association moved up Islam Appreciation Week to help educate our campus about Islamic culture in the dark shadow of an Islamophobe as our nation’s future head.The election results are terrifying. Our racist, homophobic, misogynistic, xenophobic country and campus are terrifying. But the unwavering voices of many UW-Madison students speaking out for themselves, their identities, their communities or in solidarity with their fellow human beings is an invigorating reminder of the vigilance and importance of our voices. Sexual assault remains serious issue on campusAlec Cook and Alec Shiva. Both arrested for second-degree sexual assault. Both facing charges of battery, strangulation and false imprisonment. Both students at UW-Madison. Their cases are not identical, but the similarities are striking.Multiple survivors will continue to be impacted by the actions of Cook and Shiva for the rest of their lives. We can only hope that their arrests and subsequent hearings can provide some sense of justice.Beyond hoping, we can do better as a campus community to increase awareness of the importance of consent, and not be silent bystanders. We can do better, and the university can do better, to make mechanisms for reporting sexual violence clear.The Association of American Universities Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct in 2015 tried to quantify the number of sexual assaults that go unreported, estimating only 28 percent or less are reported. This means that the students who will report sexual assault during their time at UW-Madison could be only about a quarter of those who experience sexual assault on this campus.The only, albeit small, upside of the high-profile arrests of Cook and Shiva this semester is that they may inspire more survivors to come forward. Following Cook’s initial arrest, a second survivor came forward, stating she “was empowered by another girl being able to tell what happened to her, that I thought I could now finally tell.”Survivors: We hear you, we are here for you.Wisconsin athletes voice opinions on controversial local, national topicsPolitical issues have dominated conversation throughout campus this year. UW-Madison student-athletes have also gotten involved, using their platform to advocate for their own views.Members of the men’s basketball team in particular have been outspoken and proactive. Nigel Hayes has often taken to Twitter to express his support for Black Lives Matter and other social and political issues. His teammate, Bronson Koenig, has been vocal about the DAPL pipeline in North Dakota, even visiting the site of the protest at Standing Rock to set up a basketball camp for kids. The activism of the basketball team inspired a New York Times article titled “Inside College Basketball’s Most Political Locker Room.”Athletes have also spoken out about the noose incident at Camp Randall Oct. 29. Football running back Dare Ogunbowale and other athletes circulated a statement on social media criticizing the university’s response and defending student-athletes from the assumption that they are “immune to the racial injustices that affect other students of color on campus.”Some people feel that student-athletes, particularly those on scholarship, should be grateful for their opportunity and stay quiet. We believe, however, that they are using their status as some of the most recognizable names and faces on campus for a good cause.Political activism has been a constant in the history of UW-Madison, and the fact that our student-athletes use their fame and popularity to uphold this tradition should be appreciated by all.University must protect undocumented students with Trump presidency loomingFollowing fears of President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign promises to deport undocumented immigrants, UW-Madison’s response has been both swift and encouraging.Undocumented students already face an uphill battle in college. In Wisconsin, undocumented students are not eligible for in-state tuition at any of the state’s public universities, even if they meet residency requirements, and often cannot access federal financial aid.Chancellor Rebecca Blank correctly understands that the university does not have the legal authority to declare itself a “sanctuary” campus. The city of Madison also understood this in 2010 when they instructed the Madison Police Department to not inform federal officials of someone’s immigration status, except in an instance of violent crime.Blank and other university leaders, however, stood by the accomplishments of these “student scholars and student leaders,” who should be allowed to continue their education at UW-Madison under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects undocumented youth from deportation.Recent legislation by the Faculty Senate and the Associated Students of Madison to stand in solidarity with these students is also encouraging. However, the fight to allow Madison to be a sanctuary city must continue despite the Republican-controlled state Legislature. Undocumented students provide enormous amounts of talent, leadership and intellect to UW-Madison and should be protected.University fails in response to Camp Randall noose incidentUW-Madison made national headlines Oct. 29 for all the wrong reasons. A man wearing a President Barack Obama and Secretary Hillary Clinton mask with a noose around his neck attended a home football game.The university’s response condemned the costume as offensive and said it countered the values of both UW-Madison and the Athletic Department, but defended it as free speech.From the start, Camp Randall should not have allowed the horribly offensive costume into the stadium. Eventually, event staff asked the man to leave, along with another man dressed as Trump, who held the noose.Students, alumni, Faculty Senate, University Committee and the Associated Students of Madison alike all responded to the racist costume—calling out the university for not taking a more assertive stance.It wasn’t until these groups voiced concern that Chancellor Rebecca Blank apologized for the university’s original weak apology, this time saying she understood how it hurt students of color on campus.In the end, the offenders’ season tickets were revoked, and Camp Randall installed a new policy prohibiting nooses. However, all of the change came too late. UW-Madison should have acted sooner and condemned the act from the start.The university’s original response failed to address the severity of the situation. The university prides itself on its new diversity initiatives, but failed to stand with students during this act of hate speech.Donald Trump wins presidential election in shocking mannerIn early November, the unthinkable happened—Donald Trump was elected president. Against all odds, a homophobic, Islamophobic, misogynist real estate mogul won the presidency.And Trump has been quite busy since winning the election in early November. He has appointed a number of controversial candidates to his cabinet, and most shockingly made Stephen Bannon his chief strategist.Beyond this, the president-elect has also lashed out at the media on numerous occasions. He has stated that CNN is “very unprofessional” and that the Associated Press have “lost their way and are no longer credible.”Also, in an interview with The New York Times, Trump stated that their coverage of him during the election season was “very rough,” something he believes made his campaign difficult.Such statements are an attack on the First Amendment rights of the press—rights we encourage all Americans to exercise. Call your local legislators. Call Sens. Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin. Leave them messages and tell them why you oppose certain Trump appointments—like Bannon.Fulfill your duty as an American and become engaged in our democracy. Show the world that love trumps hate. ASM representatives must be held accountable on attendanceAssociated Students of Madison is supposed to represent students. When members of Student Council and Student Services Finance Committee don’t show up, our voices are not being heard or respected.ASM makes decisions that affect every single student on campus. Some of the most important of those decisions are made by SSFC, determining where our segregated fees, $137 million of them from 2015 to 2017, go.Given that ASM is composed of students, who have other obligations, it is understandable that perfect attendance records are hard to achieve—and it makes sense that attendance is not an issue singular to this semester.However, both ASM Chair Carmen Goséy and SSFC Chair Colin Barushok have been vocal this semester about attendance concerns.Lack of attendance particularly hinders SSFC because in order to approve groups’ eligibility for segregated fees or their annual budgets, it needs eight out of 15 members to attend meetings.For Student Council, problems with attendance mean problems filling seat vacancies when they open up. To approve a nomination, two-thirds of all Council representatives need to vote them in—and there have been meetings this semester in which two-thirds of all representatives are not even present, let alone unanimous.Although students are busy and it’s somewhat unreasonable to ask representatives to have perfect attendance, these students have made a commitment, and have been elected, to represent us in these meetings.We ask that they show up.Cardinal View editorials represent The Daily Cardinal’s organizational opinion.

Scott Walker and the Wisconsin state legislature have frozen since 2012.With the approved increases in place, tuition for out-of-state students will reach $35,523 by the 2018-’19 academic year. Resident tuition, in contrast, currently rests at just over $10,400.The increases conclude a plan proposed two years ago by UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, asking for four years of such tuition increases. Blank has cited the university’s fiscal needs following an $86 million budget deficit in the current biennium, as well as rising operations costs, as reasons for the tuition hike.The Board of Regents also approved nonresident tuition increases for six other UW System institutions, though UW-Madison was the only school to request an increase of more than a thousand dollars.Regent Bryan Steil, a member of the board’s Business and Finance Committee that initially approved the increases, called the raises “too much too fast” for students across the system. Steil was one of the few regents who voted against the increases.UW-Madison’s graduate and professional students will also see tuition hikes in the next two years. Those increases range up to roughly $5,000 per year—for example, the Wisconsin School of Business’s global real estate masters program tuition will reach $43,280 by 2018-’19.Business and Finance Committee Chair Janice Mueller said that while some of the proposed increases were initially concerning, those concerns were alleviated when she learned that the money received from higher tuition will stay within the schools themselves.Regent President Regina Millner agreed with Mueller, saying she was “very supportive” of the resolution.“The system offers the only public schools of those kind in the state. Although they may be located at UW-Madison, they really represent the whole state,” Millner said. “Those schools are critically important to producing professionals.”Blank has also been vocal in pointing out UW-Madison’s nonresident tuition in comparison with other Big Ten schools.The university currently ranks fifth in the group, but Blank argued that setting this portion of tuition closer to the market rate will make UW-Madison a more marketable school.“In some cases, tuition is low enough that top students hesitate to apply to UW schools because they think the low tuition must signal low quality,” she said in a Monday blog post.The regents also approved a system-wide policy regarding sexual assault on campus, the culmination of a two-year process from the system’s Task Force on Sexual Violence and Harassment.In the upcoming months, UW leaders from around the state will begin a series of initiatives targeting sexual assault on college campuses, including launching mandatory training on the issue for all students and staff. Though much of that training for students already exists, employee training is slated to begin soon.Additionally, task force co-chairs Anne Bilder and Petra Roter announced the creation of a website that will compile support resources for students across the system who may have been sexually assaulted or harassed. They also plan to develop a system-wide campus climate survey to gauge knowledge of sexual violence.UW System President Ray Cross commended the task force’s work, but reminded regents to consider the personal aspects of the issue.““This is a really good report, and in no way do I want to diminish its importance to us, but I want to appeal to a bigger issue,” Cross said. “This issue is more than just statistics and policies. It’s our responsibility not to just put in mechanical processes or tools, but to take this personally.”UPDATE Dec. 8, 8:23 p.m.: This story has been updated to include additional information.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/12/asm-looking-for-more-campus-involvement,"December 8, 2016 | 10:00am CST","About once or twice a month, shared governance committees meet to discuss plans for campus projects and changes. Topics discussed range from student health to building expansions and improvements, along with campus climate and academic planning. Each committee serves a unique purpose, but every committee seats a number of students who serve to represent the student voice alongside university staff, academic staff and faculty. The work done on shared governance committees is extremely important, but very much is unknown by students not directly involved in the process.For example, most students don’t know that there is a shared governance committee on Recreational Sports, which has been working on planning and making decisions for the new fields and building construction that is happening on the Lakeshore and Southeast sides of campus. However, the Rec Sports Board is just one of the many committees on campus that is currently working hard to make positive changes.For example, the Healthcare Advisory Board has recently worked on advertising and informing campus about the availability of the second dosage of the Meningococcal B vaccine. While the second shot was originally planned to be administered to all students, there are now only enough shots for students without healthcare or who cannot afford the shot on their own. More information is available through University Health Services. Additionally, student committee representative Jordan Madden is working toward getting free feminine products in campus bathrooms, starting with Bascom Hall.Another example is the Budget Committee, which I currently serve on as the undergraduate student representative. The committee was brand new this fall. Our goal is to inform campus about university budget changes and procedures, as well as to make financial aspects of the university, like tuition spending, more transparent.Other committees are also hard at work. The Ethnic Studies Committee is working on developing and improving ethnic studies classes, while also evaluating teaching assistants and gauging professors on their opinions of campus climate; the Transportation Committee is focusing on controlling legal and illegal moped parking; the Committee on Undergraduate Recruitment, Admissions and Financial Aid is focusing on prioritizing minority, in-state students and diverse enrollment; the Dean of Students Advisory Committee meets often to discuss prominent topics, most recently regarding sexual assault.All this work, though, is completely overlooked by the majority of students. I often hear students complaining about wanting a say on academic changes, or how they have no say or knowledge of construction changes. The issue is, all of these decisions do have student input through shared governance. The problem may be that appointed students do not communicate with others about the work their committee is doing, or perhaps non-appointed students don’t have an interest until decisions are already made.I hope going forward, students will have more say through shared governance, as well as make bigger strides toward better communicating the work done in shared governance committees with students who are not directly involved, as we all are the individuals most impacted by campus changes.Finally, I hope that students who do not know what shared governance is have learned a little bit and acknowledge that it is an extremely important process on campus. If you would like to get involved, you can always check out committee openings online.Mara is a sophomore majoring in Political Science with a certificate in Digital Studies. She is also the campaign director for ASM’s Shared Governance Committee. What do you think about shared governance on campus? Do you think ASM should make it easier for students to be involved?

The current price of nonresident tuition is already fifth-highest among Big Ten schools.The proposal regents will receive Thursday states that the school is “confident that additional nonresident tuition increases can be implemented without hurting the ability to attract top students.”Regents will also examine the work of the system’s task force on sexual violence and harassment.The group was tasked with creating a comprehensive, system-wide policy on the issue that would combine several related policies from other regent documents.One portion of that policy requires that each school “establish educational programs designed to inform employees and students of the nature of sexual harassment, to increase their sensitivity to it, and to publicize the procedures, sanctions and remedies available against it.”Each campus’s Title IX coordinator will be responsible for facilitating that education and training, and it will be a requirement for all students and employees throughout the system, according to the proposed policy.In addition, chancellors will be required to offer more in-depth training on issues of sexual assault for executives, supervisors, managers and others in leadership roles.","Regents to consider tuition increases, sexual assault policy",UWM

In response to recent events and concerns from students, the UW Homecoming Committee hosted an educational panel Tuesday regarding sexual assault.“It seems like kind of an unusual issue for an organization like homecoming to take on, but that’s really exactly why we wanted to do it,” UW Homecoming Committee President Rheann Engelke said. “It’s an issue that’s only going to change if absolutely every organization and every single person starts taking a stand on it.”The committee partnered with We’re Better Than That, a student organization for men against sexual violence, to bring five experts on a variety of subjects related to sexual violence to Gordon Commons. Panelists included UW-Madison Title IX Coordinator David Blom, UHS and End Violence on Campus Representative Carmen Juniper Neimeko, Multicultural Student Center Director Gabe Javier, Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment Chair Cassidy Schroeder and Director of Student Conduct and Community Standards Tonya Schmidt.The panelists covered topics from specific definitions of terms like “sexual assault” and “consent,” to the process of reporting assault should it occur, as well as statistics regarding sexual assault on campus.According to Schmidt, in 2015 there were 214 reported cases of sexual assault. Responses to an Association of American Universities survey indicated that one in four UW-Madison women had been sexually assaulted. This year, there have been 274 reports of sexual assault so far.In addition to educating students on resources available to people seeking information or support regarding sexual violence like PAVE and EVOC, the panel also encouraged students to start conversations about sex and sexual assault in order to change societal norms regarding sex and consent.“The purpose of promoting consent-based frameworks is really to shift the norms away from sexual scripts of silence, [like] ‘get some,’ ‘that’s what makes you X gender,’ and into a world of mutual respect and accountability,” Juniper Neimeko said.The panelists advocated being active allies within the community and empathizing with and supporting victim survivors.“Saying that one is an ally is not enough. It has to be born out in actions,” Javier said.Dean of Students Lori Berquam said the unity between UW Homecoming and WBTT in hosting the panel must continue throughout campus in order to address the issue of sexual violence.“That is indicative of the partnerships that we need to continue to have to create this web together saying ‘this is not what we stand for on our campus, it’s not what we’re about, and we believe we are better than that,’” Berquam said.","Panel encourages awareness, activism regarding sexual violence on campus",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/11/lacking-resources-of-flagship-uw-la-crosse-struggles-to-weather-budget-storm,"November 28, 2016 | 9:25am CST","LA CROSSE, Wis.—With more than 40,000 students, a billion dollars in research activity and Big Ten athletics, UW-Madison is not only the flagship university in the UW System, but is also one of the state’s most visible symbols nationally.And while Madison has felt the effects of the $250 million budget cut to the system enacted in the state’s last biennial budget, the school’s rich research and alumni base have given it options not available to most of the state’s other public universities.UW-La Crosse Chancellor Joe Gow said that while his university took a major hit in the last budget, both Gov. Scott Walker and former Gov. Jim Doyle have consistently cut funding for the UW System in the past decade.But Gow noted that the current tuition freeze, which Walker instituted in 2012, has deepened the effect of declining state support.“The new wrinkle is the tuition freeze,” he said. “Prior to that there was some ability to offset the cuts with tuition … that’s why there’s been this reduction in resources in the past few years in particular.”UW-La Crosse has an enrollment of roughly 10,500 students, the vast majority of which are undergraduates. Student body president Jacob Schimmel said this contributes to a close-knit community on campus.“The coolest thing is the fact that you feel so involved here,” Schimmel said. “That helps promote a sense of inclusion for everybody.”But the university has been forced to cut 45 positions, mainly in support services. While no teaching positions have been cut, Schimmel said reductions in advising and student life have negatively impacted the campus experience.“The state thinks the only thing that is vital, necessary and wanted is the classroom experience,” Schimmel said. “And sure, that’s the core of the university, but there’s so much more that is vital.”He noted that funding for some student organizations, including sexual assault prevention and diversity programs, is derived from state funding. The university was unable to expand its campus climate office, despite a rise in reported hate and bias incidents.“A lot of things were cut that shouldn’t be,” he said, explaining that the office is “bare bones” after being unable to expand.Gow said if the next budget required another round of cuts, the university would begin reducing faculty positions.“We are at a point where if we have to do this again we’ll have to go into the teaching piece,” Gow said. “And that would be unfortunate because that would mean the classic bigger classes and fewer classes and that makes it more difficult to graduate.”In the face of declining funding for the system and subsequent lower salaries for folks working on campus, UW-La Crosse has also struggled to maintain a competitive pay rate for its top faculty.This is not a challenge unique to La Crosse—even UW-Madison has had to fend off other state universities looking to poach superstar professors. But while the flagship campus was able to spend close to $24 million to retain faculty, Gow said his school cannot come close to producing those funds for that purpose.“We are so strained that I don’t know many instances where we’ve been able to match a counter-offer,” Gow said.And professors at UW-La Crosse who are unhappy with their salaries need not look far to find better positions. Just across the Mississippi, faculty at Winona State University in Minnesota make roughly $5,000 more a year, and Gow said even the local technical college offers higher pay.To convince faculty and staff to stay, Gow explained that he and other school leaders work hard to ensure a great workplace environment on campus. But even that is difficult as legislators continue to criticize professors, he added.“There was this remark, ‘They ought to teach another class,’” Gow said. “I don’t know whether the people who throw that around know how demoralizing that is.”The university could see additional funding in the next budget cycle depending on how it measures up to several performance metrics, something Walker said he would like to see for all system schools. But Gow was skeptical of how that could affect both his campus and others in the UW system.For example, UW-La Crosse’s retention rate is second only to UW-Madison’s in the system. But for other campuses that may struggle to retain students, Gow argued that performance-based funding will not help them perform better until they are provided with the resources to do so.“I think there’s a cynicism to the concept, frankly, where people say you aren’t doing enough and we’re not going to give you money if you don’t do better,” Gow said.He added that tying funding to performance could, in some cases, homogenize system schools even more than they already are.“If it’s about graduation or retention rates, then what incentive do universities have to admit students who are on the margin of their academic ability?” Gow said. “That’s not what a public university is all about.”Despite recent cuts, state Rep. Jill Billings, D-La Crosse, said universities like UW-La Crosse are vital for both students and the state as a whole.Billings said the university brings significant value to her community, with students “falling in love” with La Crosse and staying in the city, while paying taxes and creating jobs.“Not all kids want to go to a school like Madison, a larger school that has a lot of research associated with it,” Billings said. “Some kids just want to go to a smaller town and be on a smaller campus, and receive that specialty that comes from the individual campuses around Wisconsin.”","Lacking resources of flagship, UW-La Crosse struggles to weather budget storm",UWM

He was convicted of first-degree homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilation of a corpse.In August, a Wisconsin lower court overturned the conviction, ruling it was the result of a coerced confession and citing Dassey’s status as a minor and learning disability.""No single statement by the investigators, if viewed in isolation, rendered Dassey's statement involuntary,"" the court said in their ruling. ""But when assessed collectively and cumulatively … it is clear how the investigators' actions amounted to deceptive interrogation tactics that overbore Dassey's free will.""On Monday, the same court ordered Dassey’s release, arguing that he does not pose any danger to the community and is unlikely to flee. Under the terms of the order, Dassey would be subject to supervision by the Eastern Wisconsin Federal Probation Office.Attorney General Brad Schimel appealed the ruling, claiming the lower court does not possess the authority to release the 27-year-old. Schimel also argues that the confession was not coerced, and that there is ample evidence to remain confident in the conviction.The Attorney General filed an emergency injunction to stay Dassey’s release pending the outcome of the appeal, which was granted by a three-judge panel in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.",Appeals court halts Dassey release,UWM

Last year, [an administrator] referred to me as ‘little girl,’” Coker said. “They referred to us as girls, as children … I feel like we struggle for legitimacy.”And it is not only in contact with administration where the pair faces challenges—representing a largely white campus with widely varying viewpoints presents its own set of difficulties, even inside ASM.Coker and Goséy recalled struggling during the first few Student Council meetings to keep control of the floor, a duty assigned to the chair through Robert’s Rules. Coker said some men on the Council talked out of turn and over Goséy, although the pair agreed that problem has mostly been solved.Leading ASM is challenging even in isolation from the current pressures Goséy and Coker face, a reality they prepared for by gathering advice from their predecessors, former Chair Madison Laning and former Vice Chairs Kyla Kaplan and Vanessa Studer.Goséy said Laning taught her to take a step back and remember to appreciate the work that she is doing.“I think I focus on the negatives so much that it starts to consume me, and I don't pay attention to the positive, which is an issue,” Goséy said. “When [Laning] was talking to me about it, I was able to take a step back and go, ‘Well, we have accomplished things, we've done things, like as a community and as an individual I've learned and been able to make change in small ways.’”The two discussed the successes that ASM has already accomplished, including moving the corporate Amazon pickup point location from the Red Gym, pushing for a policy that would bar nooses from future football games and registering thousands of students to vote, as well as broaching the issue of sexual assault even within the governing body itself.Both said in regard to sexual assault within their own communities, it is difficult to make people see the intersectionality to their identities and they are often attacked for “going after black males.”“We see people playing the oppression Olympics when it comes to sexual assault and campus climate,” Coker said. “It's just really frustrating, because I shouldn't have to deny the issues that I face as a woman so I could stand in a march [for Black Lives Matter]. It doesn't make any sense.”Goséy and Coker both held grassroots committee leadership last year—as Legislative Affairs chair and Equity and Inclusion chair, respectively—but said they face much more criticism now, as well as an exponentially increased responsibility to represent the entire student body and address every need.“Black women have been called upon to take the emotional brunt of everyone else. We're told to take care of everyone else, make sure that everyone else is OK, but no one really cares for us,” Coker explained. “We're expected to respond to everything and to everyone, and everything that happens, but no one really asks us if we're OK, rather than each other.”Though the chair and vice chair are only required to meet once a week, in actuality the pair talk almost every day, Coker said, crafting a solid working relationship, a balanced approach to leadership and a lasting friendship. They said they continually ask members of ASM, as well as the larger campus community, to challenge themselves in thinking about intersectionality and the identities of others.Despite the critiques and setbacks they have faced, Coker and Goséy said they have already grown.And in-between juggling ASM duties and attending class, they both emphasized the importance of self-care and meaningful relationships—not getting lost in the day-to-day and focusing on making changes that will move the university forward, especially for students who may not have felt at home at UW-Madison before.“I feel like we're helping pave the way for other women of color, other marginalized people who feel like, ‘Maybe I'm not supposed to do it,’” Coker said. “But looking at us—no, they can do it.”","ASM chair, vice chair usher in pivotal moment for diversity in student government",UWM

Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, said individuals, albeit perhaps implicitly, place a woman’s maternal role before her professional one.“The first thing my colleagues will say to me is ‘How are your kids?’” Sargent said. “But if a male colleague who has kids is standing right next to me that’s not the first thing they say to them.”Double standards for politicians who are women can be identified by deconstructing stereotypes associated with gender, according to professor Janet Hyde, director for Research on Gender and Women’s Studies at UW-Madison.In a panel regarding the 2016 election, Hyde stated that these associations are partially to blame for the disapproval women in politics face from the public.Men are associated with “agentic qualities,” Hyde said, which she explained as “self-confident, self-reliant, dominant and ambitious” characteristics. In contrast, women are most affiliated with their emotional availability and care function.Hyde also noted that implicit condescension toward women profoundly affects their behavior; because agentic qualities are associated with men, political leaders are expected to acquire them.According to the Center For American Women and Politics, in every political leadership role, less than 30 percent of women hold those positions. Additionally, of the 99 members in the Wisconsin State Assembly, there are 23 women.Sargent experienced the effect of such disparities firsthand when she was elected in 2011.“Part of that was being more aware of how I dress or the words that I choose to use or the tone that my voice is making, ‘Don’t get too emotional, Melissa’ or the speed in which I talk,” Sargent said. “I am more aware of all of that than I was before I came [into office].”This shift in behavior parallels the “norm of emotional restraint for men,” which Hyde defines as a causal factor in the gender stereotypes of emotions.“If women are agentic, then they are violating gender stereotypes and they are disliked,” Hyde said. “People, in general, don’t like stereotype violators.”Hyde also addressed the consequences of gender stereotypes in the political world during the 2016 presidential election.Donald Trump’s “ready expressions of anger, to many people, are power and dominance emotions,” Hyde said, arguing that the president-elect’s rhetoric and actions are within the framework of masculine stereotypes.The 2016 presidential debates also marked a time for Sargent to relate her experiences as a woman to the rhetoric between Trump and Clinton; for example, she felt uncomfortable when Trump continuously stood behind Clinton in the second debate.“It reminded me of times when I was walking down a street and I could hear footsteps behind me, but I was afraid to turn around,” Sargent explained.Trump’s dominant stance, similar to his numerous interruptions, “is a way to exert power and dominance in an interaction” Hyde said.Sargent addressed Trump’s “locker-room talk” tape as evidence of sexual domination over women by men: “It’s not locker-room talk,” she said. “It’s proven behavior that he has exhibited on other women.”Jennifer Higgins, associate professor at UW-Madison with a focus on women’s reproductive health, also spoke at the panel.She said in her women’s book club they discussed this incident at length, and found that “every single one of us had multiple stories of being groped” or sexually assaulted in one form or another.“[Out of this election] has risen a new narrative about the ubiquity of the way in which people experience sexual harassment,” Higgins said. “I think that ultimately there will be, I hope, a moment of cultural zeitgeist in that area.”At the panel, both Hyde and Higgins claimed that discussions will emerge surrounding women’s equality in response to the election in its entirety.According to Higgins, she hopes “we all can keep working toward a sexual culture in which we don’t have to worry so much about our daughters.”Professor Hyde also voiced her hopes for a similar world by restating a quote from Michelle Obama: “Strong men, men who are truly role models, don’t need to put women down for themselves to feel powerful.”","Professors, politician reflect on gendered stereotypes in elections",UWM

The protest stopped at the intersection of West Johnson and State Street before turning up Henry Street and continuing down Langdon Street. The event concluded at Library Mall, where activists had the opportunity to share their own experiences and thoughts on the protest.Kim Gasper-Rabuck, a former student at Madison, addressed the protesters at Library Mall.“You will never forget where you were on November 9, 2016,” said Gasper-Rabuck. “Because you know what, this is the beginning of a fight that will last the rest of your life.”In recent weeks, numerous sexual assault allegations against suspended student Alec Cook have raised even more awareness to what is a prevalent issue on campus. According to the most recent results from a climate survey conducted by the Association of American Universities, more than one in four women at UW-Madison reported being sexually assaulted, with many of the perpetrators being males known by the victims.Teddy Shibabaw, a representative from Socialist Alternative, which co-sponsored the event, said he believes that rape culture on campus is just a reflection of a larger problem.“I think it mirrors the whole society,” Shibabaw said . “Even a place such as a university, supposed to be promoting learning, tolerance, unity and openness, creates these types of problems, so at every area we’re going to have to fight it.”Protesters also voiced their frustration after Tuesday’s presidential election, when Republican candidate Donald Trump won amidst sexual assault allegations and critique following lewd comments he made on a 2005 video released by The Washington Post.“The fact that Donald Trump got elected has shocked people and has essentially woken them up to the need to actually be present to build movements in defense of people that are going to be attacked,” Shibabaw said .Gasper-Rabuck concluded her comments by saying students deserved better.“We deserve a better culture, we deserve a better society, we deserve decent lives, and we deserve not to be sexually assaulted on our own goddamn campus.”","Students, protesters rally against sexual assault on campus",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/11/historically-marginalized-students-sad-and-scared-after-trumps-win,"November 9, 2016 | 10:33pm CST","When walking to class the morning after Election Day, UW-Madison sophomore Ali Khan said he felt like someone close to him passed away.In his classes Wednesday, classmates of Khan were laughing about the election results— a perspective wildly different than his own, as he has friends who “are fearing for what is going to happen to them.”“It felt like it only affected you, and I feel like today, these students are not just historically marginalized, but feel marginalized today,"" Khan said.Many students from groups that Donald Trump regularly targeted during his campaign echoed Khan’s feelings. UW-Madison senior L. Malik Anderson, co-founder and president of Black Journalists Association, said he felt the same worry when the final piece of the electoral puzzle fell into place for Trump.“I was terrified for everyone who represents those marginalized identities. You’re talking about people of color, women, people who fall into the LGBTQ spectrum, Muslims,” Anderson said. “It was almost like we rewinded back to a decade that I've never had to live before.”Throughout Trump’s presidential campaign, he made numerous remarks that drew outrage from many Americans.In the second debate, Trump said stop and frisk “worked very well” in New York City, though the practice came under questioning for it’s use of racial profiling. When first announcing his run for presidency, Trump said Mexican immigrants were “rapists” and were “bringing drugs” and “bringing crime.”Throughout his campaign, Trump came under fire for his treatment of women. In a leaked video, Trump was heard bragging about being able to sexually assault women. Trump has proposed a temporary ban from the U.S. for Muslim immigrants, “until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses.”

Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence, championed a bill while he was governor of Indiana which would allow businesses to deny services to LGBT individuals. Pence argued the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed in 2013, preserved the religious rights of Indiana residents.“People don't get that this is more than just an election for some people,” Anderson said. “It's about people's identities and lives being under attack and not feeling safe anymore. I don't know what to expect after January. I don't know if I’ll be safe walking outside of my home.”Wisconsin chooses TrumpThe victory also strikes closer to home for many students, as Trump won Wisconsin at roughly 1:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, a victory that virtually sealed the election for Trump. Being in a state that supports Trump has caused some unrest for students, also.“You never know who you could be walking with who don’t agree with you and don’t want you to be in this space,” UW-Madison freshman and member of the Muslim Student Association Zahiah Hammad said. “You don’t really feel welcomed at this school. It's hard … people were asking if they should walk me home, just because they know this campus may not be the safest place for a certain type of people.”Because of how “sad and scared” many of the students were following Trump’s victory, Gabe Javier, director of the LGBT Campus Center and Multicultural Student Center, said he prioritized providing a space that student could come together in.The MSC opened their space on the second floor of the Red Gym for students to discuss their feelings regarding the election or to simply relax. The MSA held also a group gathering there to create community following Trump’s victory.“I think it's a space people should know that they can come to and process however it is that they need to, it's open for that,” Javier said. “It's understandable that it can be hard to be in other spaces of campus, especially with homecoming this weekend. this can be a place for people to take a break and other spots in the red gym.”Javier said the MSC’s resources with counselors from UHS are flexible, so he could ensure they would be available for students, as the election results shocked many students who expected Clinton to win the election handily. Most pre-election polls favored Clinton’s chances in winning the White House.UW-Madison political science professor and expert on polling David Canon said this election was unprecedented because all the polls were remarkably off, including the most recent Marquette poll, which is usually accurate in Wisconsin.He said Trump was successful among individuals who had not decided to vote according to polls issued one week before Election Day, most likely because of FBI Director James Comey’s announcement of the reopened investigation into Clinton’s emails.After Election DayStudents agreed that their advocacy cannot stop following Clinton’s loss.“The work starts now for us,” Hammad said. “We need to stay together and we need to push forward I think is the best we can do, and as young people especially our work means something. This might be a lesson to people in America and I think we need to make the best of it.”Khan, chair of the Equity and Inclusion Committee, said he is going to continue to push for Associated Students of Madison to represent and help these different marginalized communities on campus. In addition, his committee is working on some campaigns to help improve the campus climate.Javier said he thinks the next step is to continue being present for his colleagues and students that are feeling hurt.Javier said these communities should continue to “push our white allies to show support for people of color and our straight allies to show support for the LGBTQ community, not just when there is an incident or emergency, but to really integrate that into their practice.”",Historically marginalized students ‘sad and scared’ after Trump’s win,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/11/trump-wins-white-house,"November 9, 2016 | 2:02am CST","Harnessing bitter resentment toward America’s shifting social norms and economic base, the political upstart Donald Trump wins the race for America’s presidency over the heavily favored Hillary Clinton.No matter the label that leaders of either party brought down on him—bigot, misogynist, ignorant, sexual predator—Trump remained afloat. A block of disgruntled white voters propelled him to victory, latching onto his message of law and order, economic nationalism and anti-elitism as a salve for a changing America they no longer recognized.On the economic front, Trump’s derision of free trade deals like NAFTA, which he claimed sucked industrial jobs to places like Mexico, resonated in blighted post-industrial communities. Stung by the twin engines of globalization and technological advance championed by elites on both sides of the aisle, these voters coalesced to bring down the establishment icon Clinton.“They take our jobs for a lower bid and they put us out of a job,” said John Bly at a Trump rally in Janesville last spring. He explained how he lost his union job at a car seat supplier when the city’s GM plant closed in 2008. Gaunt and wearing beat-up work boots, he explained that to get by he took a job as a delivery driver for a fraction of his former wage.Trump pledged to remain the voice of those like Bly who felt America had left them behind.“The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,” Trump said in his victory speech in New York City.He said he would reach out to those who opposed him in the quest to “Make America great again.”“We will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and rebuilding the American dream,” Trump said.To many pundits, however, Trump’s campaign was about nothing more than white identity politics and contempt for the nation’s elites, intellectuals and social norms of decency.After descending Trump Tower’s gilded escalator as a political newcomer last year, he wasted no time calling Mexicans “racists” and promised to build a “beautiful wall” on the southern border. He remained true to form throughout, suggesting barring Muslims from the country, threatening to enhance libel laws to freeze the free press and calling for the implementation of unconstitutional “stop and frisk” policies to thwart inner-city crime, all before last month’s “Access Hollywood” tape showed him telling Billy Bush how he conducts sexual assault.But Trump voters didn’t seem to care.UW-Madison’s College Republicans filled two full floors of Brickhouse Barbeque on West Gorham on election night to celebrate.“I think Mr. Trump has a way to go with reaching out to people in the past he’s alienated,” conceded Alex Walker, CR chair and son of Gov. Scott Walker. “But our chapter is excited about him winning.”Walker predicted that UW-Madison students will warm up to Trump, a tall order for a campus that helps make up Dane County, 70 percent of which voted for Clinton.“I think that students will have a chance to hear from Trump more and less from the media that basically has been out to get him,” Walker said, repeating a recurring anti-media trope from Trump’s campaign.With campus support or not, Trump will ascend to the presidency in January.",Trump wins White House,UWM

Mailick said her office has focused on funding and supporting graduate education, as well as faculty members’ pursuit of cutting-edge research projects. She said she hopes research initiatives such as UW2020 will help to retain faculty.“I do worry about the impact of budget cuts that our campus has experienced,” Mailick said. They will have an impact on research … I worry that our wonderful faculty will be tempted to move to other universities, as we know many other universities are trying to lure them away with higher salaries … we hope that the efforts we’re making to strengthen our research funding will have their intended positive effects now and into the future.”Gary Brown, director of campus planning and landscape architecture, then presented updates to the university’s Campus Master Plan. Brown highlighted the new landscape plan, the green infrastructure plan and new utility projects, such as one slated for Bascom Hill. Other notable updates include constructing a bridge at the intersection of Charter and Linden to alleviate traffic and adding 2,000 parking spaces to campus.Chancellor Rebecca Blank then addressed two hot-button student issues: the Obama noose costume worn at the Oct. 29 football game and the arrest of suspended UW student Alec Cook, who was arrested for sexual assault. Blank apologized for the university’s response to the costume incident.“I am personally very sorry that the hurt that this incident and our response to it has caused,” Blank said.Blank also reiterated the university’s commitment to taking sexual assault allegations seriously.“The safety of our students with regards to sexual assault is absolutely paramount,” Blank said. “The recent case of an individual charged with multiple sexual assaults, I must say, is deeply troubling. It makes me heartsick.”The meeting concluded with the body adopting changes to faculty tenure review policy made since the the September Faculty Senate meeting.","Faculty Senate discusses noose costume, Alec Cook, faculty tenure",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/11/the-daily-cardinal-editorial-board-takes-a-look-at-the-2016-election,"November 7, 2016 | 8:00am CST","Clinton deserves student vote for recognition of campus sexual assaultHillary Clinton must be our next president.She is immensely qualified. Sexist rhetoric may call her bitchy and cold, but these negative terms can be reclaimed to describe two of her most important presidential traits—her intelligence and unwavering calm.In the succinct words of President Barack Obama, “[there is] nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America.”Trying to describe Clinton’s qualifications requires a laundry list of her successes, throughout her varied roles as first lady, a senator and secretary of state. For over three decades, Clinton has been refining the skills necessary to be an excellent leader.Some young people are considering not voting or voting for a third party candidate because they view this election as voting for the “lesser of two evils.” Our editorial board sees only one evil: Donald Trump.The candidate who is literally divisive, who wants to build a wall between our country and Mexico. A man spewing aggressive and condescending language on the level of hate and bias claims on this campus. The candidate who brushes off sexual assault and rape culture as “locker room talk.”Based on her stance on sexual assault alone, Clinton is the best candidate for students. The recent arrest of UW-Madison student Alec Cook, an alleged serial rapist, has reminded our campus that rape culture is an ongoing and pervasive issue.More than one in four undergraduate women will be assaulted during their time at UW-Madison, and these rates nearly double for certain marginalized identities, according to the 2015 AAU survey. These statistics stress that sexual assault is something that affects—whether directly or through fellow students—every single student on campus.This is a community issue that we do not have the privilege to ignore.The Obama Administration has made progress through the “It’s On Us"" campaign, focusing on sexual assault awareness, that we cannot go back on. Electing Clinton will not only continue this initiative, but expand on it.Clinton’s  platform on education has prioritized addressing sexual assault on campus, divided into three areas. The first discusses the importance of inclusivity in providing comprehensive support to survivors. We need to provide resources to students to ensure that they are heard. As Clinton stresses in a video addressing survivors, “You have a right to be believed.”Having a president who recognizes the intersections and nuances of campus sexual assault is essential.The second aspect of Clinton’s plan is to ensure a fair process. The process of reporting sexual assault, as discussed last fall by our  editorial board, can be difficult to navigate, especially in the wake of trauma. Clinton’s description concurs, calling reporting confusing and convoluted.While we should be striving to improve the reporting process for survivors, increasing prevention efforts is paramount—as addressed by the third component of Clinton’s plan.The Tonight Program is an example of an attempt at proactive education on sexual assault. Its recent reboot is a positive sign of the university being willing to re-evaluate and improve prevention efforts. These changes are in line with Clinton’s policy, which states “It’s not enough to address this problem by responding only once sexual assault occurs—we need to redouble our prevention efforts and start them earlier.”In stark contrast to Clinton, Trump hasn’t released any details about a plan to prevent sexual assault on college campuses. He has proven again and again that he doesn’t understand what sexual assault is, defending his respect for women despite mounting reports of his own egregious behavior.A student leader on our campus, former Student Council Representative  Kenneth Cole, recently stepped down from his seat amid allegations of sexual assault less numerous than those currently leveled against Trump.Hundreds of students signed the petition for Cole to step down, demonstrating our community’s judgment. If we can expect a member of Student Council to resign following assault allegations, then we can and should hold presidential nominees to a higher standard.Other members of UW-Madison’s student government said their ability to work with student organizations focusing on sexual assault on campus, such as PAVE and EVOC, was hindered before Cole’s resignation. Allegations against a Student Council member have the power to negatively affect student government’s relationships with advocacy groups; imagine the impact reports of sexual assault by a president will have on national climate.Voting is a simple way to impact national and local climate. It is a way for each and every citizen to voice their judgment of which candidate they want representing our nation. Casting a ballot may seem arbitrary, but has real ramifications for our university and community.For students who think sexual assault is a problem on campus—which should be all students—Clinton deserves your vote.Feingold’s student debt policy makes him best choice for undergradsAs of 2016, 44.2 million Americans cumulatively owe over $1.3 trillion in student debt. Students who graduated in the Class of 2016 left school with an average of $37,000 in debt. This issue impacts young people nationwide, and is no different in Madison—70 percent of students in Wisconsin graduated with debt, according to the Institute for College Access and Success. This year’s election deals with many important issues, but to the students here, college affordability and accessibility should be a top priority.Incumbent United States Senator Ron Johnson, and former Senator Russ Feingold continue to battle in one of the most important down-ballot races in this year’s election. The Democrats hope to retake control of the Senate, and a Feingold victory would go a long way in helping them achieve their goal. Feingold’s commitment to the needs of all Wisconsinites, as well as his superior plan to make college more affordable, make him the right candidate for the job.Helping students with debt has been one of Feingold’s main focuses since he launched his campaign. The former senator has spent time at more than a dozen college campuses over the course of this campaign speaking to students, demonstrating a commitment to put his constituents’ interests first.Feingold’s devotion to everyday Wisconsinites shines through in his plan to make college affordable to all. He supports increased budgets from the states, which would make a college education more accessible to those who struggle to afford it. He also seeks to allow students burdened with loans to refinance their debts—a process that’s already been implemented effectively to help Americans pay their mortgages.His stance on the issue contrasts sharply with Johnson’s, who infamously stated that student loans were “kind of free money” in 2015. Johnson has also insinuated that many students don’t graduate in four years because “college is fun” and that students don’t focus their freshman year.UW-Madison students should take many issues into account when considering candidates this year, but student debt and college accessibility should be a top priority to all—even those who don’t have debt themselves. Students need a representative in Washington who will advocate for them and their interests. Russ Feingold’s genuine drive and desire to work on making college affordable to all, as well as his long history of promoting a progressive agenda that would better the lives of his constituents, make him the clear choice.School referendum key to future Badgers’ quality of educationAs voters flood to the polls this year, it’s easy to get so distracted by the presidential candidates that the backside of your ballot becomes nearly forgettable. This Election Day there’s one extra box for Madison voters to check: a referendum to increase Madison public schools’ budget.Currently the district’s revenue cap places a limit on how much money the school district can raise through state general aid and property tax. This Madison Metropolitan School District 2016 Operational Budget referendum would permanently increase the school district’s revenue limit by $26 million across four yearsFor UW-Madison students who don’t have children in the public schools, this may seem unimportant. However, a large percentage of the thousands of K-12 students throughout Madison will become Badgers just like current students.Without the referendum, upwards of 120 workforce positions are in jeopardy. Less teachers means bigger class sizes, leading to less individual attention per student. A $26 million budget increase sounds hefty, but breaks down to an average property taxpayer impact of $36 per year.The referendum would help the large amount of Madison students who live below the poverty line and ensure additional teachers to give each child attention in class, not just students living in the wealthier suburbs of Madison. Limiting a young student’s chance at a valuable education because paying a few extra dollars a year is irritating is not an excuse.Every student deserves the right to an enriching education. These kids can’t vote on Tuesday, but the quality of their future lies in the hands of people who aren’t even in the public schools. If we want an educated future electorate then we have to educate youth now. Granting MMSD this $26 million budget increase gives students a better education, which should be a right—not a privilege.If the referendum doesn’t pass, the board would face a $12 million budget cut for the 2017-’18 school year, just the start of many cuts to come. If UW-Madison students were upset about the recent budget cuts the UW System faced, they should care about this just as much. It’s time to think of the students this Election Day; vote “yes” on the referendum, and give the next generation of students a chance.Cardinal View editorials represent The Daily Cardinal’s organizational opinion.

""A lot of times they are either forgotten or overlooked.""The group has roughly 30 members in the community, and UW-Madison student and member of UW Formation Alexandra Adams said the group intentionally represents the diversity found within the community of black women on campus.""It was a personal mission, I suppose, to gather not just certain aspects of blackness,” Adams said. “They wanted to recruit women who were all different sizes, all different skin tones because there is not just one black. We're not a monolith.""Tielman-Fenelus and fellow student Kay-Jah Charles started the group last spring after Beyonce's song “Formation.”""It's wonderful when prominent black artists release music, because, here on campus, we all talk about it,” Adams said. “That kind of creates and builds community in that way too.""Now, Tielman-Fenelus is trying to plan how to best grow UW Formation, and she said she is deciding if they want to become a registered student organizationTielman-Fenelus said she has also been working with UW-Madison’s admissions office to possibly show the upcoming video to black women in local high schools to encourage them to pursue higher education and to let them know there are people in college like them, which was a struggle for her when she arrived to Madison.She said it seemed like a lot of her classmates did not interact with a person of color before arriving to college, and that microaggressions are real and common.""It just felt like nowhere I went I belonged,” Tielman-Fenelus said. “I've never had a problem being the only black person in a class, but here it was like all eyes on me.""'The planned video hopes to showcase around 30 student participants. Tielman-Fenelus said she’s hoping to shoot the video either at the end of this semester or the beginning of next. The group was approved for a grant of roughly $4,600, which will help pay for equipment, costumes, sets and food for the women, according to Tielman-Fenelus.The video is going to include particular scenes to showcase black women on campus, and Tielman-Fenelus said she hopes to have one of the scenes at Camp Randall with the girls dressed in cheerleader outfits.""It's to say that we also have school spirit because a lot of people think that we don't,” Tielman-Fenelus said. “We want to show that we have school spirit, that we are cheering for the rest of our community and we hope that they cheer back.""Adams said she had a difficult semester when she first arrived at UW-Madison. She found herself isolated frequently as a freshman on campus. Adams, who said she is a sexual assault survivor, continues to advocate for herself and tell her story in hopes of helping other people through their difficult experiences.This mirrors UW Formation’s mission, which Adams said is to be present and visible so other students can find community in them.""The main goal of UW Formation is to reach out to future black women Badgers and say, 'It's OK, you can find love and support here.'""",Students aim to form community for black women with visual project,UWM

Morrison, who said she knows someone who was sexually assaulted by Cole, explained why she has been adamant about Cole’s removal from ASM at an open forum during the Wednesday meeting. “I know they’re just allegations, I know there hasn’t been a trial,” Morrison said. “But by saying that we aren’t going to do anything until our messed-up criminal justice system does something, we are perpetuating rape culture, and I’m not going to stand for that.”ASM Vice Chair Mariam Coker also said that a victim came forward in confidence to her and ASM Chair Carmen Goséy, and both said they have since individually been working to address the issue. Cole said he denied all of the accusations that have been brought up by members of ASM.“Continuing throughout the summer, I tried to do everything that I could,” Cole said. “I met with Title IX, I met with various different people, I sat in a room and met with the chair and vice chair of ASM.” Coker said during the summer months, Goséy attempted to reach out to Cole but he would not return messages. Coker added that she and Goséy met with Cole near the beginning of October and asked him to step down from his role on ASM.Cole said he did not refuse to resign, instead stating he wanted to think about it first.Coker, visibly upset, left the room during Cole’s speech. When she returned Coker questioned Cole’s understanding of sexual assault, inciting a heated exchange between the two.“There were multiple times throughout his statement where he invalidated survivors especially at the times where he was saying, ‘This was done to me,’” Morrison said. “There are also survivors of Kenneth Cole who feel unsafe and hurt that need to be heard as well.”Cole’s resignation follows a petition started by Coker and Morrison two weeks ago calling for his removal from the group, which Morrison said had gathered around 450 signatures. While the petition did not directly mention the allegations, Morrison and Coker referenced them when sharing the petition on Facebook. Accusations emergeCole was initially confronted at an April 29 meeting of the organization BlindSide, a politically active student group, where they deliberated on who should run for leadership positions in ASM. Morrison brought forward the allegations at the meeting, stating that she had friends who had been assaulted by Cole and she did not feel comfortable with him in a leadership position.“In that meeting, I was accused of sexual assault. At that meeting many of you were there,” Cole said. “I stood there and I explained what my character was and who I am as a person. I sat there and tried to explain, and I’m not going to convince anybody.” The allegations were also discussed at a spring meeting Morrison called the “women’s caucus,” which included a handful of women on ASM. Donale Richardson, a former leader of BlindSide, said he saw the way “women in general” were treated as members of the organization and concluded there wasn’t much of a concern for women’s health issues or promoting female leadership. “There were some women who really wanted to work together to solve sexual assault issues on campus, but they were the only ones,” Richardson said. “It wasn’t like everyone else on BlindSide was trying to do a lot to make that a more apparent issue on campus.” Following the accusations against Cole, BlindSide largely fell apart. Morrison, a former member of the group, immediately disaffiliated. Soon after, a letter was sent to some BlindSide members defending Cole by detailing “several contradictory pieces of information brought forth by accusers.” Richardson said many members quickly jumped to Cole’s defense. He cited the way the situation was handled as a main reason he also left the group.Following the May 1 Student Council meeting where leadership for the upcoming year was elected, The Badger Herald, a student newspaper on campus, published an article naming Cole as the alleged assaulter. The article was later updated with his name removed. Cole addressed this article during his Wednesday speech, saying he has talked about possible “repercussions” from the article.Continued concernsThe issue again publicly resurfaced at an Oct. 6 Student Council meeting in the body’s open forum, where UW-Madison student Garrett Pauli expressed his concern with Cole remaining a representative for students. Pauli later said in an interview with The Daily Cardinal that his context for the information he brought forward stemmed from The Badger Herald’s previously published article.Pauli had shared his concerns about Cole with Coker that day, after which Coker recommended he speak at the open forum. Pauli was joined by UW-Madison students Cortez de la Cruz and Samantha Adams, who spoke more broadly about how ASM deals with issues of sexual assault on campus.  “It set the stage for how we treat each other,” Coker said about how the allegations affected the council. “The way these situations were treated, the way that people were talking about it, the way the people were triggered in these spaces, the way opinions are completely disregarded in these spaces—that's affected how we treat each other.”Student Council Representative Janelle Perez expressed disappointment in how ASM handled the situation. “As a representative for ASM, I believe that this issue at hand should have been addressed a while ago,” Perez said. “I’m not really sure why it dragged out this long. There’s not a lot of communication going on.”Coker said that Cole’s resignation would allow the body to work more efficiently in addressing the problem of sexual assault. “I feel that now we can do sexual assault-related campaigns without people questioning whether or not we care about sexual assault,” Coker said. “Now that we have an alleged sexual assailant off of Student Council, work that we can do with PAVE, EVOC, Campus Women's Center around such issues will be taken seriously.”Following Cole’s speech, UW-Madison student activist Brooke Evans announced her intent to run for Cole’s now vacant seat. After Cole left the meeting Wednesday, Goséy addressed the body.“Men, hold yourselves accountable. Take some ownership. Take some damn ownership for your actions,” she said. “We want to play that all white people are racist? Men, take ownership and stop sexually assaulting women.”UPDATE NOV. 3, 4:05 a.m.: This article was updated to include additional information.

Their efforts include spreading awareness of these issues at events and through outreach materials, as well as providing a safe space on campus for survivors of sexual assault and their allies to build a community of support.One in four women will be sexually assaulted in their time at UW-Madison, according to last year’s campus climate survey. PAVE said they hope they can engage the UW-Madison campus in regards to tackling issues of sexual assault and dating violence.“A lot of people think that sexual violence is a women’s issue, but it’s not,” said Samantha Garlock, PAVE’s finance and office coordinator. “It’s important for men to be involved in violence prevention.”Any UW-Madison group can request a workshop with PAVE. Common workshops discuss defining consent and how to support a survivor of sexual assault, but they can also be custom-tailored to fit the needs of the specific group requesting the workshop.PAVE also has a resource library located in their office in the SAC. The library has books on different kinds of sexual violence and healing methods. The office offers a safe space for students to access these resources.“You might not want to check things out from the library if you’re worried someone might see what you’re reading,” Garlock said.PAVE’s largest programs are their three main “awareness month” initiatives. These efforts include: Domestic Violence Awareness Month in October, Stalking Awareness Month in February and Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April.Any UW-Madison student is welcome to request a workshop, volunteer or utilize the resources offered in the PAVE office.",Student org fighting against sexual assault presents budget to ASM,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/10/snapchat-filter-promoting-sexual-consent-to-have-trial-run-halloween-weekend,"October 27, 2016 | 6:07pm CDT","A group of student activists collaborated to create a Snapchat filter that reminds students to get consent before sex and raise awareness about the sexual assault climate on campus.Student activists Ella Sklaw, Tyriek Mack, Marisa Skelley and Justine Jones met with Associate Dean of Students, Kevin Helmkamp, to discuss their idea about creating a message about getting sexual consent.

The pilot filter will run Oct. 27-30, and because most sexual assaults on campus take place at night, the filter will run 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. each day. Users can send their screenshots to consentsnapsuw@gmail.com for the group to see. The filter, created by junior Lana Scholtz reads, “Get Consent this Halloweekend” and will be accessible in all residence halls, dining halls and both Memorial Union and Union South.

Sklaw came up with the initial idea and discussed the benefits of using Snapchat to promote consent and to reach people outside of UW-Madison.

“What is so great about Snapchat as a medium, for doing this, is the message expands beyond the confines of the university because of Snapchat stories,” Sklaw said.

The students’ long-term goal is to have a new sexual consent filter every weekend next semester, should the pilot run smoothly.

In addition to promoting mandatory consent, the group hopes to spark the creative interest of students by allowing them to submit customized filters and captions each week.

“We really want students to be engaged in creating this because ultimately this is by students and for students,” Mack said.

Mack said he decided to help with the project because of his involvement with the Greek community. He said he understands first-hand how men can perpetrate misogyny and the kind of culture that enables sexual assault to be an issue on campuses.

“Being from my background, I just thought it was important to use my leadership to try and make some sort of impact,” Mack said.

Campus climate surveys have revealed one in four women will experience some form of sexual assault during their time at UW-Madison. As a result, the university now requires freshmen and transfer students to take the online program Tonight in addition to attending an in-person workshop to better address sexual assault.

“The conversation doesn’t end when students ‘ex’ out of the Tonight program or walk out the door,” Sklaw said. “It has to be an ongoing conversation because it’s an ongoing issue.”

Sklaw also discussed the meaningful partnership with Helmkamp in supporting and funding the Snapchat filter.

After accusations of multiple sexual assaults against senior student Alec Cook came to light, an outcry from students for the campus to better address sexual assault has taken place.

“Not necessarily to just that case, I think this need to address sexual assault has existed for multiple years on campus,” Helmkamp said. “And we as a university are continuing to ask how we can improve and do this better. Particularly on the proactive, preventative and educational approach.”

A collaborative effort by students and faculty could be one effective way to address sensitive topics like sexual assault on the UW-Madison campus.“A Snapchat filter isn’t going to end sexual assault,” Sklaw said. “But I think a Snapchat filter is going to meet students where they are and say, ‘Hey remember when you’re going out tonight, consent is this cool thing we have already been talking about and we need to keep having this conversation.’”",Snapchat filter promoting consent gets trial run Halloween weekend,UWM

Cook entered a plea of not guilty on the misdemeanor charges.Cook’s attorneys, Chris Van Wagner and Jessa Nicholson Goetz, will notify the District Attorney’s office 48 hours before Cook posts the bail.Cook’s bail was set on the condition that he remains in the Dane County Jail until he has had a hearing to address non-monetary conditions of the bond.Five separate accusers have come forward, the first of which mirrors the original criminal complaint. One woman accused Cook of inappropriately touching her during a ballroom dance class they both took during the spring. Nicholson Goetz believed these accusations were not valid, and that the other four women consented to intercouse with Cook.The defense said the criminal complaint does not support the “slaughtering” of their client that has occurred in the media over the last 10 days, an issue which they addressed in a press release Thursday. The complaint does not show that Cook stalked woman or possessed stalking notebooks.“There’s nothing to support the monster that exists in the minds of all of the people of UW-Madison,” Van Wagner said. “This is what we were waiting for. This is what the state believes they have.”Nicholson Goetz said they have not seen the notebooks that have been referred to in the media. They have one page of a notebook, which she described as “misquoted” from their previous hearing.Van Wagner showed a photograph of the page, which showed a bullet-pointed list that described meeting people and nothing violent. There was no category marked “kill.” The page had the word “killed” which was crossed off and with a question mark next to it in the top right right corner that Van Wagner said could mean the death of a relationship. The list had categories for qualities of individuals, such as “major” and “what makes her special.” Van Wagner said they contend that they do not know what the list is.“There was no woman named, there was no description of violence or anything of that nature,” Nicholson Goetz said. “Certainly I have not seen anything released that fits the description as things have been reported.”Cook will return to his parents’ home in Edina, Minn. if he is released. He remains banned from UW-Madison.“We are going to focus on defending the criminal case,” Nicholson Goetz said. “I don’t want to see Alec’s future permanently put on hold, and so that is a concern. The primary concern is protecting his liberty.”","Judge sets Cook's bail at $200,000",UWM

He will speak, and audiences will listen. After all, he’s a projected first-round NBA draft pick and a media darling who just happens to lead a team that may be one of the best in the country.He’s using this platform to shed light on issues that he believes are important, most notably the Black Lives Matter movement and the payment of college athletes. Who are we to tell him to not use his status to share his opinions?Let’s start with Hayes’ comments regarding Black Lives Matter. In a summer that included the murders of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and Keith Lamont Scott, Hayes took to Twitter to express his opinions.“Racism towards black people isn't getting ‘worse’, it's getting filmed and shared for all to see what actually goes on. #BlackLivesMatter,” wrote Hayes.As is often the case with BLM debates, Hayes received a ton of backlash from his followers, of which he has 75 thousand.A lot of it was the usual responses from All Lives Matter people, but there were also plenty that wanted him to keep his mouth shut and just keep throwing an orange ball through a hoop.But here’s the thing: even if you disagree with Hayes’ viewpoints, telling him to not talk about issues that are important to him is ludicrous.Yes, Hayes is a basketball player, and a good one at that, but he’s a human being first. We’re all taught to stand up for what we believe in. Why is this different for Hayes just because he is a successful college athlete?More recently, Hayes made headlines for bringing a sign to College GameDay that read, “Broke college athlete, anything helps.” Again, this prompted similar responses from the public about Hayes being too outspoken and how he should just focus on basketball.Ultimately, what it comes down to is this: Fans care more about the team and Hayes’ success on the court than they do about him standing up for what he believes in. They think Hayes will cause some sort of a distraction, or that his performance will suffer because he talks too much about social issues and other injustices. Which begs the question, should that really be our main concern? Considering the reach Hayes can have and the children that look up to him, I find this pretty unbelievable when you consider a college superstar like Jameis Winston, who set an example that sexual assault and stealing is okay, as long as you’re a big-shot athlete.But even if you disagree with his positions, it’s hard to deny that Hayes fights for what he believes is right, a value that we can all learn something from. He’s setting an example to kids everywhere to stand up for themselves. That’s not something we should be discouraging.Nigel Hayes is more than a basketball player. He is an intelligent, eloquent, deep-thinking black man who is using his large audience to get a message across. He refuses to waver or back down from his beliefs, even in the face of harsh, and often racist, criticism.The Badgers are poised to make another Final Four run this year. They are deep, experienced and talented. They are well-coached and hard-working and determined. Much like the team that nearly won it all two years ago, this team has lofty expectations.But even if those expectations aren’t reached and Hayes struggles this year, when his collegiate career comes to a close, he will be remembered as far more than just a basketball player. He will be remembered as someone who always stood up for what he believed in.And that’s something that we should all be proud of.Never change, Nigel.Is Nigel Hayes setting a good example for children by speaking up for what he believes in? Should he stay quiet and focus on basketball?

Three other women whose cases are being investigated have reported that Cook assaulted them to police.The charges from last week’s reports will be rolled into the new complaint, according to Assistant District Attorney Colette Sampson. The charges will include 11 felony sexual assault counts, two counts of false imprisonment, one strangulation count and more than 15 misdemeanor sexual assault counts.UW-Madison Police Department released a statement Monday that said they referred Cook to receive 15 counts of fourth-degree sexual assault to the Dane County District Attorney.

After sexual assault allegations hammered the Republican nominee and WikiLeaks exposed potentially embarrassing Clinton speeches and emails, the two candidates eagerly dove into the weeds of policy details, highlighting their disagreements over the Second Amendment and partial-birth abortions.However, the debate quickly turned bitter when the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, pressed Trump on the allegations of sexual assault that surfaced last week. Trump angrily denied the women’s stories.“I believe, Chris, that [Clinton] got these people to step forward,” Trump said. “I didn’t even apologize to my wife because I didn’t do anything. Nobody has more respect for women than I do.”Clinton responded by laying into Trump for perpetuating an atmosphere of disrespect toward women.“Donald thinks that belittling women makes him bigger,” Clinton said. “He goes after their dignity, their self-worth and I don’t think there’s a woman out there who doesn’t know what that feels like.”In response, Trump attempted to pivot toward Clinton’s emails and foundation as evidence of her disqualifying character.“She’s guilty of a very serious crime,” he said. “She shouldn’t be allowed to run. I say it's rigged.”Trump dug in when asked by Wallace for clarification, accusing Democrats of rigging the election in Clinton’s favor by registering voters who “shouldn’t be allowed to vote.” He looked at the camera and threatened to take the unprecedented step of refusing to concede should Clinton win, which would jeopardize the peaceful transition of executive power.“I’m keeping you in suspense, OK?” Trump said.Back at UW-Madison, students clutching pitchers of beer in the SETT at Union South gasped at Trump’s threat. On the TV, Clinton quickly retorted.“That’s horrifying. We’ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. He is denigrating, he is talking down our democracy.”Leaning back in his chair, UW-Madison Junior Tim Glennon chuckled as the debate droned on.“Honestly I would say I am past all sadness,” the self-professed libertarian said. “I have lost all hope.

While he has already alienated many women, he continues to poll well with men. According to a map released by FiveThirtyEight, Trump would win by a landslide over Hillary Clinton if the only people to vote in the upcoming election were men. This map led to a social media firestorm, with Trump supporters calling to #RepealThe19th, which would take away women’s right to vote.Trump’s campaign has not been a positive one. Whether he is insulting minority populations, mocking those with disabilities, degrading and green lighting the sexual assault of women, or muddying the election waters with below-the-belt insults toward his opponents, Trump has taken the Republican party into a space of caustic negativity and hatred. His views are radical and not representative of many people in the party, but some voters feel they don’t have a choice but to support him.Because of the fact that he has gone against the odds and made his way to the general election ticket, Republican politicians from around the country have banded together to support their candidate, despite his controversial policies. However, enough is enough. There is only so much that people can be willing to support just to make sure their basic ideals are upheld in the most important office in the country. After Trump’s video went viral, politicians began distancing themselves from him, vowing to either write-in their vote this election or simply pledging not to vote for Trump.Trump is continuing his campaign trail and is coming to Wisconsin Monday. However, many prominent Republican politicians from Wisconsin—Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ron Johnson—are going to be skipping his campaign stops. While none of the aforementioned men have officially withdrawn their support from Trump, it is a bold and inspiring move for them to skip such an important campaign visit in their home state this close to election day. Many voters feel bullied into voting for Trump because he is the only Republican option, even if they disagree staunchly with his messages of hate. For important Republican figures to be distancing themselves from the party’s presidential frontrunner is not only bold, but it sends the message to voters that they should do the same.Wisconsin politicians and voters should follow the lead of our state’s voices who have had the courage to step away from Trump. We do not need a man in the oval office who is so blatantly against what this country is about: freedom and equality. Trump’s behavior is appalling and not that of a presidential candidate. We should get past the fear of voting for another party that is not our own, instead voting for the candidate who we see as most morally fit for the job.Samantha is a sophomore majoring in journalism and communication arts.

Later, several women who said they had been sexually assaulted by Trump came out to the media to have their voices heard. Even though Trump apologized after the release of the video from 2005, the scandal still became ubiquitous in newspapers, drawing a great deal of attention.The Republican presidential candidate is having a crisis, and it is being illustrated by his vast drop in the polls.In the meantime, a U.S. ship fired missiles on Yemeni rebels, and Wikileaks, an anti-secret organization, released thousands of emails from Clinton’s private email server.Trump’s scandal was covered more than both of these incidents, and was discussed over and over again in the media. The repetition of a certain incident is referred as priming in media theories. What the media covers and how great of an exposure its audience has to it plays a big role in politics.If people are only made aware of a controversy for one candidate and not of another, they could be mislead when heading to the polls.Trump has shown disrespect and discrimination to people of different genders, ethnicities and national origins, but he is not the most important thing happening in the world.However, it appears that the media does not see it this way. The media’s job is to convey accurate and unbiased information to voters; its journalists shouldn’t solely be focused on reporting events that will bring in an audience. Media outlets have an obligation to inform voters, especially during an election year, not just line their own pockets.When the FBI was investigating Clinton’s private email server, it quickly became the focus of the media. If one was to have only read the headlines at the time, Clinton may have come across as nothing more than a dishonest, secretive candidate.Can Trump or Clinton represent the U.S. better? There is no single answer here. For each voter, this is a question that will require careful thought and consideration. However, without neutral and authentic media coverage to inform voters, information that voters deserve to have, they may be forced to make a decision in an arbitrary way. This could lead to a disastrous outcome in the presidential election.A well-informed electorate and rational decision-making are crucial to a democracy. Trump’s attitude and his previous experience with women, is, indeed, an important issue for the voters, and it should not be overemphasized. There are other important events happening in our world, ones that may have just as big of an impact on the future of our country as the presidential election. Democracy is a collective effort to try and make the best decisions for a nation.The media plays an enormous role in both America’s democracy and democracies overseas. And because of the significant role it has, the media must return to providing the everyday person more holistic news coverage. Focusing the majority of its coverage on one event is simply unacceptable.Flora is sophomore intending to major in journalism and music.

The press conference suggested Trump would take the offensive during the debate.The conference was in retaliation to a 2005 video recording that uncovered Trump making derogatory comments about women, released by the Washington Post just two days before the debate. In the aftermath, many Republican leaders rescinded their endorsements and made critical statements of the business mogul.Clinton had also been hit by controversy ahead the debate. The same day of the 2005 video reveal, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from Clinton’s campaign chair that portray Clinton as a candidate who appeals to different ideas in public than she does in private.The debate, moderated by Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, was in the form of a town hall meeting, with half of the questions coming from audience members and half from the moderators.The kickoff question inquired whether the candidates were modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today’s youth. In the next 90 minutes, the candidates attacked each other’s character and continually fact-checked one another.Trump, after a fiery first 20 minutes, was more aggressive than in the first presidential debate and answered questions that challenged Clinton’s judgement on immigration, healthcare and foreign policy.The debate ended on a positive note, with the candidates complimenting each other and shaking hands.","Trump, Clinton go on offensive in second presidential debate",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/10/trumps-actions-come-as-a-surprise-to-few,N/A,"On Oct. 8, news sources around the country released audio caught on a hot microphone from 2005 capturing Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump with Billy Bush, then of “Access Hollywood,” bragging in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women. In the video, Trump says that “when you’re a star, they let you do it.” He also admits he would commit sexual acts with a married woman and grab any woman by their genitalia. Trump began to receive sharp criticism by Republican leaders, with many of them going as far as to drop endorsements of his political campaign. Many individuals, however, still seem to take Trump’s words as an example of the behavior typically associated with the phrase “boys will be boys.” Phrases such as these are expressing that this behavior is typical and should be of no surprise. Trump apologists also dismissed the comments as “locker room banter,” which implies that this is how all men talk about women behind closed doors and is to be expected. That in and of itself is gross. As much fun as it is to watch Trump crash and burn, I don’t really understand why his most recent comments have come as such a surprise to everyone. This is the same man who said he thinks women look better on their knees and that he’d probably be dating his daughter if they weren’t related. While he’s undoubtedly said incredibly misogynistic things before, his recently released set of comments demonstrate a clear disregard for consent and that is what I find most alarming about this incident. We are all well aware by now of his obvious lack of respect for women and therefore expectations for him are unbelievably low, but it always comes as a surprise when a human being shows that level of conceit and ignorance. Trump’s comments basically imply that it is okay for him to sexually assault women because he is rich and famous. The argument of “You and I both said and did things in our younger years that we wouldn’t have wanted to be recorded. You can’t hold onto mistakes someone made 10 or 20 years ago and hold it against the individual” uses logic that only applies to when you’re in your thirties, max. Not seventies. Trump was barely under sixty years old when he made those comments. Can you really argue for an immature 59 year old? I think not.Trump admittedly issued an apology for his leaked statement, making the claim that he’s not a perfect person. Isn’t it a bit of a stretch to say you are not perfect when you are found saying you will grab a woman by her genitals because you are famous? You use the phrase “I’m not perfect” when you show up late to class or you forget to get your lab partner a birthday present, but I believe it doesn’t cover it when you use it in Trump’s case.With the GOP stuck with Trump on the ballot, some Republican officials have abandoned Trump. But why haven’t the voters done the same? According to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted immediately after the audio was unearthed, fewer than 39 percent think Trump should end his presidential campaign, while only slightly more voters, 45 percent, think he should not drop out. What is unfathomable is that Americans hear a man tell someone he has no issue committing an act of sexual assault and yet some of us still find him fit to become president.Donald Trump has a decades-long history of misogynistic comments and crude sex talks, from discussing how he got away with going backstage when the contestants were naked in beauty pageants he hosted, to saying a woman past age thirty-five screams “check-out time.” Americans need to wake up and realize this man is a misogynistic pig who will not and cannot change; even if he could, few actually believe he would want to. He’s a truly disgusting human being and it is beyond me that anyone could vote for him, especially women. It seems, at this point, as if the only thing that would stop Trump supporters for rallying behind him is if he said he actually respected women.

The news comes after U.S Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and others called into question the issue of Wisconsin’s sexual assault kit backlog.Baldwin released a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch Wednesday asking the U.S. Department of Justice to take “immediate steps.” The letter was in response to a recent USA Today investigation that revealed more than 70,000 sexual assault kits are untested, and 6,000 of those kits were found in Wisconsin.Despite the Wisconsin DOJ receiving $4 million in funding in September 2015, little headway has been made.The state still lacks a hotline for rape victims and has thousands of kits scattered throughout the state.The delay is due to the Wisconsin Department of Justice taking months to create a survey of untested evidence for police agencies, with law enforcement agencies failing to respond to the survey.The untested kits have caused widespread outrage across the country. Rape kits provide forensic evidence of sexual assaults that could lead to identifying rapists.Baldwin said she will continue to fight for these victims, saying in the letter the backlogging in Wisconsin is “unacceptable” and that she demands “a strong commitment from Attorney General Schimel to get the job done.”Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel responded to Baldwin, explaining Wisconsin just recently received approval to test the remaining kits.Schimel said that in the next couple weeks, DNA scientists will be testing the kits while the department works to collect any untested kits in the possession of law enforcement.An additional $1.1 million has been granted by the U.S. Department of Justice to further improve the backlog in Wisconsin.",State DOJ agrees to test backlog of rape kits after public outcry,UWM

Each of the performances, from headliners like Whitney to the local talent of Trophy Dad, was intimate, exciting, free and therefore accessible to many students. The flaw was an obvious factor of the night, the space. The Frequency did not accommodate everyone who wanted to attend, and it bares discussion that the venue is a more dangerous place than other Madison locations for people who are vulnerable to sexual assault. Past Snake on the Lake venues were more inclusive due to both their locations and capacity.The Frequency is known for having quality sound, and for being an intimate venue where Madisonians come extremely close to their favorite acts. It’s also known for having people collapsing from heat exhaustion. While for some the space was exciting, others were left out, and more were prevented from enjoying the music because of the way its small space made their bodies more vulnerable than others. WSUM should consider these factors when booking a show that traditionally shows off Madison’s music scene to incoming freshmen, while drawing huge names like The White Stripes and Whitney.Before Trophy Dad even played, a large man came out from The Frequency and told the fans who stretched around the block that they could no longer let anyone in. They were already at capacity and there was a fire hazard. I was a few steps back from the door, and decided I would wait to see if anyone left. The usual line shenanigans, namely cutting, ensued. People found friends farther up in line and jockeyed for positions, while others left with long faces.As the night went on, it seemed that fewer and fewer people were able to stand the literal heat. More people were in attendance for the openers than for the actual headliners.One could argue that the people left outside were not as dedicated as the fans who had the time to line up early to get in, but, I and many other people who showed up late had obligations. We had jobs, relationships, classes and general necessities of survival to take care of before we allowed ourselves the joy of live music. At past Snake on the Lake events, people could show up at the more public spaces like the terrace and James Madison Park as their lives allowed.I trust that the students at WSUM made the best choice they could with the resources and information available. WSUM is of course limited by its own financial constraints, and perhaps the Terrace was overlooked due to the construction. Despite these factors, WSUM should be aware of what is lost when a show takes place in a venue that is more exclusive to certain bodies and genders.

“The workshop is meant to feel like a 90-minute experience where students can talk about what it’s like to hook up or have sex in college,” Johnson said.SexWIse is just one option first-year and transfer students have in order to complete the in-person educational requirement for UW-Madison.

Other in-person options include DatingWIse, which emphasizes healthy relationships and dating violence, and ListenWIse, which aims to build a skill base for supporting victims of sexual assault.

Students looking to satisfy the requirement who prefer a less intimate setting can attend a theatre-based performance at the Overture Center run by UW-Madison’s Sex Signals program throughout the next two weeks.

Prior to this year, the online program Tonight was the only educational requirement concerning sexual assault for incoming freshman and transfer students.

Tonight, similar to the WIse series, aims to prevent sexual assault and dating violence. Both the online and in-person requirements are now needed for new students on campus.

The requirement changed last year after the university participated in an AAU Climate Survey. Results revealed that 1 in 4 undergraduate women will experience some form of sexual assault at UW-Madison.

“Key recommendations were to expand the first-year education program to a multiple-dose prevention program,” Johnson said. “Tonight is a really great start, but it cannot be the end of the conversation.”Johnson also expressed the goals for both online and in-person programs to promote bystander readiness among students.“Hopefully in creating a dialogue students can think, ‘If I’m feeling this way about sex and dating and hooking up, my peers might feel this way, too,’” Johnson said.",SexWIse kicks off first UW-Madison mandatory educational workshop,UWM

Here are four of their initiatives to track throughout the semester.1. Push for voter registrationMany students will head to the polls Nov. 8 ready to cast a vote in their first general presidential election.ASM has registered more than 500 students to vote since Aug. 29, and Goséy said the organization hopes to reach its goal of 5,000 students registered by the election.In addition to voter registration, which Vote Coordinator Billy Welsh explained can only take place through Oct. 19, ASM will continue to host voter awareness events detailing what to bring to the polls. During the registration process, Welsh added, students can use their bus passes as proof of residency.2. Biennial budget expectationsFollowing the 2015-2017 state biennial budget, the UW System absorbed roughly $250 million in cuts that had significant effects on university operations.Goséy said that the upcoming budget, which will be announced near the start of the spring semester, may again force ASM to evaluate which programs are valued and need to be funded by steadily rising student segregated fees.Student Activity Center Governing Board Chair Katrina Morrison said it would be important for ASM’s Legislative Affairs Committee, chaired by Sally Rohrer, and other concerned students to lobby for their education, to ensure UW-Madison is not “massively” cut again. Morrison said it would be important for state legislators to “fund” the tuition freeze so that further cuts to the university do not actually increase costs for students.3. Ensuring medical amnestyMorrison also said ASM is working to get a medical amnesty bill passed in the legislature that would promote more reports of sexual assaults by clearing both parties—the victim and the person who called 911— of any criminal charges, regardless if they were drinking.A sexual assault bill passed last spring is a step in the right direction, Morrison said, but the medical amnesty bill would provide further protection against any consequences bystanders or victims of a sexual assault could face in reporting the incident.4. Promoting shared governanceWith shared governance—a process that allows for equal decision-making representation for students, faculty and staff across campus—no longer secured in state statute, Goséy said ASM will continue to push for it to become a campus-wide policy.Students and all relevant stakeholders should have a say in decisions concerning university operations, Goséy argued, like having a seat on search-and-screen committees for new UW-Madison leadership.

Stepping into her shoes for the time being is Brian Bridges, an officer in his fourth decade with the force. Bridges is no stranger to campus law enforcement, having worked at UW-Eau Claire before coming to UW-Madison. Bridges has no intention of remaining chief?the future permanent chief will be chosen by the university from a pool of applicants from all over the nation, most likely in November or December of this year?and will return to assistant chief status once one is selected. For the time being, he will lead UWPD during the busy fall season of Badger game days and Halloween. He sat down with The Daily Cardinal to discuss his plans for handling these events and other common occurrences, and what he expects from this semester.Q: What are some of the biggest challenges that you expect to face as UWPD police chief?A: I've been here for 32 years, and in that time I've spent the last roughly 15 in senior management. We're doing a couple things?we're tripley accredited, so our main accreditation effort will start this fall and go into early spring, and that takes a lot of thought and effort to make sure that we're meeting all our benchmarks. We've started a number of initiatives under Chief Riseling that we're going to continue, things like public information with the ""Tell Us"" campaign and ""Don't Be That Guy,"" which raises awareness for sexual assault and its reporting. We're working with our partners in University Housing and University Health Services for the ""First 45 Days"" initiative, which seeks to educate incoming students, freshmen in particular, about the “dos and don'ts” on campus and living together as part of a community. I think we'll also be working on how to make sure the community understands how to get along together a little bit, how to be Badgers together and support those initiatives on the campus.Q: You touched on educating individuals on sexual assault. I'm aware that there's a new Title IX coordinator at UHS; how will you work with them to raise awareness about sexual assault and combat related issues?A: We all have our piece of it. [UWPD] typically gets involved either very early on through an investigation, but, because there's so many ways that people can report Title IX issues to the campus, sometimes we intake those reports and are the first responder, other times we are made aware of a report and encourage the victim to come talk to us. Sometimes we are just aware that the incident happened, but if the victim doesn't want any further contact with the police then our involvement is rather limited. It can be in any one of those formats, as well as pushing information out when appropriate if it's an urgent situation.Q: What plans do you have to combat these challenges, and the others you mentioned earlier, and maintain safety on campus, especially with busy game day weekends coming up?A: The absolute good and bad news is that I've been doing this for a long time and, fortunately, not a lot of new ways are being introduced into the mix, so football game days look pretty typical from one year to the next. The challenge this year is that we have a few late afternoon games and we also have two night games, and I believe that is a first for us. That brings a challenge because one night game is centered around what is traditionally Halloween weekend, so we have a lot of people in town for Badger game day, and the positive experience of the game day atmosphere that surrounds Camp Randall will transition into the exciting Halloween atmosphere of the weekend. It's going to be busy, it's going to be challenging, and we're going to need the whole community to help each other. The police, whether it's UWPD or Madison Police Department, can only do so much at these really busy times and we need other folks to step up and make sure people are staying safe.Q: A safety issue that is prominent during weekends such as those is underage drinking. How do plan to take action against that problem?A: Underage drinking has been around for a very long time. We use behavior-based enforcement, which typically means there's something else that happens to draw the attention of officers to that person that's underage. Usually by the time we're in contact with the person they're pretty intoxicated?they may be incapacitated and require a trip to detox, they may be loud and obnoxious, or just need help finding out where they are. We've tried to maintain a pretty even keel; we don't really have any interest in going out and just ticketing anyone that's underage for an alcohol violation because, frankly, we'd be too busy, and what's the point? So, typically, there's a fight, vandalism or, everyone's favorite, public urination, those things that bring us into contact with students and, during the course of the investigation, we find out that they are both underage and drinking and typically receive citations for that. Also, it's bigger than just the police department. We learned long ago that the biggest impact we can make on incoming freshmen's drinking habits is right away. We bring education and enforcement; the Unions have programming before classes start, residence halls have a huge piece in that through teaching students about safe alternatives to drinking on campus. We know that most of the more serious crimes we see usually involve the victim, the perpetrator, or both being intoxicated. The big issues typically correlate with alcohol use, so the overuse of alcohol probably remains our biggest safety issue on campus.Q: Can you explain to me the policy for what UWPD does when an underage, intoxicated person calls to get help for someone else?A: We have a guideline that we follow called the ""responsible actions"" guideline. If your friend is incapacitated and needs help and you've been drinking, the guideline states that if you call police for help and get your friend what they need and cooperate you will not be cited for underage drinking. The person who calls, who does the right thing, does not need to feel afraid that they'll get in trouble because they've been drinking. If we are made aware of a sexual assault victim, that victim is not cited for underage alcohol consumption because they need help. Typically, they have been a victim because of use of alcohol or some random set of facts, but we want them to come forward so we can get them to the right resources. If they choose to use a different university resource that's fine with us, but we do not cite those victims of sexual assault. Typically people in the community that are doing well by trying to report that something has happened to their friend will not get cited because they are trying to help and do the right thing. Again, we're focused on behavior-based issues because on any given night there's probably 10,000 underage drinkers that aren't doing anything wrong. It's the ones that are doing wrong that we want to hold accountable and the victims that we want to get help for. The other category we see frequently throughout the year are those that are so intoxicated that they need to go to detox. Those people do receive a citation to put them in the very start of the court system where they can get resources about education on drinking. They get a citation as part of a follow-up visit with a police officer, which typically involves a visit to the individual within a day or two of the incident. We explain what the citation is and the process. Then, as part of the ""First 45 Day"" initiative, we have student debriefers that meet with the student outside the police department and gather data about what led into that experience. They gather that information and put it in a report so the university can address how to make an impact on other students, whether it’s alcohol drinking or a component, and put an end to risky behaviors.Q: Can you explain in detail what the ""First 45 Days"" initiative is?A: In the first 45 days of the school year we track data closely. We work with UHS, who compiles the report, and then they compare it. We staff certain times and locations heavily during these days to build community expectations. We are always at the residence halls in the evenings during these times and will make sure you're safe if you look questionable. Enforcement and education are two pieces that we have in this around the clock. UHS, the Dean of Students office and Housing also have roles in this. It's really trying to set an expectation early in the year, and what we've seen in the last three years is that crime and underage drinking is lower second semester since we've started to work to educate people around the area at the very beginning. It really lets people know what's going on, and helps to acclimate students to campus and give them the help they need to succeed.Q: Switching gears a bit. Last year we saw a rise in student demonstrations towards the end of second semester. What strategies do you have for controlling these, and what restrictions should students know before participating in these kinds of events?A: This is UW-Madison. Student protests and community involvement is one of the reasons that people come here. We encourage people to express their civil liberties, and we will facilitate that. If someone wants to march, we'll help get them across the sidewalk. Where the issues are is if someone expressing their constitutional rights bumps up against somebody else's constitutional rights, we have to mitigate that. It's, again, really just an educational effort. We don't mind protests; it's really what this place is about, and has been about in the time that I've been here. We'd rather students be involved in what's going on in the world than chasing Pokemon. We expect protests, they raise social awareness and consciousness and are a good way to become involved in the community. 99 times out of 100 they are very peaceful, but the city has made it clear that there are guidelines. If you sit in the street for too long, they are going to come and arrest you. But we anticipate that, that's one of the things that makes this place great, is that sifting and winnowing of ideas and people advocating on the part of others.Q: One such protest occurred last semester when an officer interacted with a student who was in class, which your predecessor, Sue Riseling, publicly apologized for. What are your views on classroom sanctity, and how will you handle situations that require you to approach a student who might be in class at the time?A: Typically we want to reserve that for emergency circumstances. We've adopted a policy that clarifies that. There is no rule, other than the procedure that we created, that prohibits an officer from going into any classroom. But we do want to save that for an emergency.Q: What is something you want every student to know as you begin your position as interim chief of UWPD?A: As you see from events across our country, we need everybody to participate in making this a better and safer campus. People need to learn about each other and take the time to develop a frame of reference and educate ourselves about the issues in society, what issues people personally have going on. It really takes all of us to support all of our students, support everyone. People bring different things with them, and most of it does not start the day they get here. We want to be a welcoming place to everyone, and people need to speak up for others, because some people can't speak up for themselves. We need to be a welcoming, safe space for the exchange of ideas. That takes all of us.",UWPD interim chief discusses plans for keeping campus safe,UWM

UW-Madison and federal officials have not specified what the investigations are looking into or how they started.The first three UW-Madison investigations opened between February and May 2015 and remain incomplete. Only two universities have had more investigations opened by the Department of Education—Stanford University and Saint Mary’s College of Maryland each had five; Kansas State University and Princeton University had four, the same as UW-Madison.According to the article, the Chronicle of Higher Education states that investigations such as this are opened due to complaints from students or a federal compliance review. The goal of these investigations is to reveal whether institutions are adequately addressing sexual violence on campus.UW-Madison spokeswoman Meredith McGlone said the university is open to the investigation, according to the article.“UW-Madison is dedicated to taking a broad array of steps to prevent sexual violence, hold perpetrators accountable and support survivors,” McGlone said in a statement. “The university’s approach to sexual violence is transparent, data-driven and constantly being improved. We welcome (the Office for Civil Rights’) review as an opportunity to improve and are cooperating with the investigation.”",UW-Madison under fourth investigation for handling of sexual assault cases,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/07/dnc-five-things-to-watch,"July 24, 2016 | 1:40pm CDT","The first of the 2016 nominating conventions is in the books and the attention of the political world now shifts to Philadelphia and the Democratic National Convention. The Daily Cardinal will be back on the ground providing updates at dailycardinal.com and on Twitter at @CardPolitics. Here are five things to watch in Philly:1. Will Hillary be able to make nice with progressives?After a surprisingly long and divisive primary, the biggest question for the convention will be whether Clinton will be able to successfully extend an olive branch to the most liberal wing of the party.The process has already begun. After much hemming and hawing, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., finally decided to endorse Clinton earlier this month. The move came after he extracted historically generous concessions for a primary runner-up. He has pushed Clinton to the left on issues such as college affordability and health care, both of which are reflected in what is the most progressive party platform in history. This is because Sanders was able to appoint several members of the platform committee, including noted activist Cornel West, and this has allowed him the unprecedented ability to shape the platform.This means that Sanders’ supporters will arrive in Philadelphia largely sated and happy. Polls have showed them unifying around Clinton faster than expected. But there are still members of the party who are unhappy with her stances on everything from trade to her vice presidential pick. Trotting out Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a progressive icon in her own right, will help smooth things over, but Clinton will need to continue her outreach to the most liberal wing of the party.2. Introducing Tim Kaine to the worldIn one of the most predictable vice presidential choices in recent memory, Clinton opted to tap Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate. The choice is shockingly sensible: Kaine is fluent in Spanish from his time as a missionary in Honduras and should be an effective surrogate for Hispanic voters. He represents a swing state, Virginia, and while pundits are split on whether a running mate boosts the ticket in their home state, the consensus is that a slight bump exists. This is key in a state which President Barack Obama won by three points in 2012. Clinton trusts Kaine, something which matters to the former Secretary of State. And Kaine is highly effective at reaching out to the same blue collar workers who may otherwise be intrigued by the populist message of Republican nominee Donald Trump.Kaine is not perfect, however, and the most glaring flaw is that there will be a letdown in the progressive wing of the party that Clinton didn’t choose Sanders, Warren or New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Never mind that Sanders or Warren were never remotely in consideration, the fact of the matter is that Kaine will likely leave many leftists feeling high and dry. Kaine is not, however, a blue-dog Democrat: He has a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood and an F rating from the National Rifle Association, showing his strong support for gun control. His speech Wednesday night of the convention, as well as signs of support from the most progressive of his Senate colleagues and President Obama, will be key in determining how he is received.3. Protests?After a Republican convention in which little of the expected protest activity materialized, many are keen to see if groups will take to the street in Philly. Pro-Sanders groups, environmental activists and Black Lives Matter groups are among those expected to turn out, with city officials saying they are expecting upwards of 50,000 protesters a day. The main hub of activity will be Roosevelt Park, which conveniently borders the complex where the convention is taking place. Progressives say they will be camping out there, with daily rallies expected. Violence is not expected but we could see arrests. Also important will be the messages the protesters give off--will they show large-scale infighting within the party or merely squabbles over certain issues? Democrats will hope for the former to project an appearance of party unity.4. Star powerRepublicans had some of their biggest members at the convention, but the most high-profile members of the party, including George H.W. and George W. Bush, Mitt Romney and others, were not at the convention as an act of dissatisfaction with Trump. The Democrats, on the other hand, will have Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama at their disposal. Virtually every major Democratic governor, senator and official will be speaking, including Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Wisconsin Rep. Gwen Moore. Celebrities ranging from Lady Gaga to Snoop Dogg are expected to be in Philly, performing for attendees. And then there will be Clinton herself, who is expected to speak at a larger venue, accepting the nomination in front of supporters in hopes of creating the pep rally-like atmosphere Obama had eight years ago in Denver.5. Students will play a greater roleIn Cleveland, the issue of college affordability was little discussed, with a throwaway line in Trump’s acceptance speech on student debt marking the most high-profile discussion on the topic. It did make an appearance in the GOP platform, but given the weight Sanders has put on making college free or more affordable, as well as the fact that Democrats see it as a wedge issue to win over young voters, there will likely be a robust discussion on the subject. The plan to make public college free for less affluent students, championed by progressives, will garner attention, as will issues including affirmative action, campus sexual assault and expanding government student loan programs.",Five things to watch at the Democratic National Convention,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/07/5-things-to-watch-rnc,"July 15, 2016 | 10:37am CDT","The Daily Cardinal will be on the ground at both the Republican and Democratic Conventions. Follow here and @CardPolitics on Twitter for comprehensive updates from Cleveland and Philadelphia.With the Republican National Convention starting Monday, here are five things to watch as thousands of delegates, media and observers flock to Cleveland.1. How the convention will be unconventionalThis is, in some respects, a trick question; as this year’s convention will be very different than normal. Many of the most prominent voices in the Republican party, including past presidents George H.W. and George W. Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, will not be attending. Rank and file members have concocted excuses to make themselves scarce in Cleveland, with Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake leading them all by saying he will skip the event to “mow his lawn.”The reason behind all this is of course Donald Trump, himself, the most unconventional presidential candidate in recent memory. In turn, he has promised a convention that will be replete with pageantry and absent the normal “boring” political speeches. Speakers from ex-football player Tim Tebow to UFC President Dana White to each of his four children will appear. While Trump will likely not speak each night, as he initially considered, the Trump brand of grandiosity will be everywhere, right down to the stage he accepts the nomination on.2. How the convention will be … normalThat all being said, people may be surprised at how this year’s convention will resemble those in the past. The Trump campaign will not get to completely turn Cleveland into one giant Apprentice set.The platform will need to be written, per usual. It is possible that conservatives who are not quite enamored with Trump will use it to underscore some Republican values that the business mogul doesn’t tout prominently: abortion rights, trade and foreign policy all come to mind.Despite Trump’s disdain for sleep-inducing political speeches, those too will be present. Guests ranging from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will take the stage in Cleveland for the requisite prime time speeches. While some big names will be missing, party heavyweights like Walker and Cruz will lend some political gravitas and keep some sense of normalcy to the proceedings.3. The movement to “Dump Trump”Even though political junkies have mostly cast their dreams of a contested convention aside, there are more than a few rumblings that Trump’s status as the presumptive nominee will be challenged in Cleveland and an attempt to install a more traditional choice will take place.What would that look like? Follow along closely, because its complicated. One route that anti-Trump proponents want is for delegates to simply vote for another candidate, citing convincing research showing that delegates are not actually bound to vote for someone despite what the RNC may insist.The second option is the more complicated one. A posse of Rules Committee members, who have set the bylaws of the convention, want to move to either unbind the delegates or allow them “to vote their conscience” (i.e vote for someone other than Trump). The group, which has termed themselves Free the Delegates, would potentially allow the dumping of Trump to commence if a majority of all delegates coalesce behind another candidate and cast their votes for them.The problem with this plan is ultimately the math. Leaders of the group have said they have the votes needed to move forward but given that there are dozens of Trump supporters on the Rules Committee, a simple majority seems unlikely. Moreover actually coalescing behind a candidate and getting the majority of delegates needed to support them on the convention floor will prove to be even more trying. But it is far more likely that the group will meet the 28 delegate threshold in the Rules Committee required to have a full vote on a conscience clause measure the convention floor. Regardless of if this succeeds, it will likely lead to a messy floor fight that will embarrass the RNC, embolden Trump supporters further and lead to a prime-time show that should not be missed.4. Protests, protests, protestsEvery convention sees protests of some sort and those movements often lead to clashes between police and protesters. It is a virtual certainty that both pro-Trump and anti-Trump forces will take to the streets of Cleveland regardless of the scenes on the convention floor. The magnitude of those movements (and the police response) are evoking images in many people’s minds of the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, which was fraught with anti-Vietnam War protests and violent crackdown on activists. A few things have led to this with the first obviously being the controversial nature of Trump, who will inspire fervent opponents and supporters to hit the streets. In addition, questions of whether the original plan for protests violated the First Amendment caused a federal judge to order the city to re-do its restrictions. The resulting plan could cause more confrontation between opposing groups and more confusion as law enforcement agencies scramble to keep protesters, delegates and media safe. Will we see the same level of violence as 1968? This is one question that no one quite knows the answer to.5. The importance of studentsIt is unlikely that college affordability will play as big of a role as it will in the Democratic Convention a week later, as the Republicans will probably choose to showcase other issues. But young people will still be vital in shaping the convention, and their fingerprint on the Republican party has been increasing, defying the stereotype of the Grand Old Party. College affordability and school choice will play into the drafting of the platform and young activists will attempt to affect the party’s stance on everything from abortion rights to immigration. While those strains of the party will be more visible in Philadelphia, they will certainly be present in Cleveland as well. For example, a section of the Republican platform currently insists that instances of sexual assault on college campuses should only be investigated by courts and not the universities themselves. The draft argues that to do otherwise “contravenes our country’s legal tradition” and that “it must be investigated by civil authorities and prosecuted in a courtroom, not a faculty lounge.” This puts the RNC at odds with many prominent activist groups and while a party’s platform is not officially binding, it does represent an official statement of purpose. There will likely be more to follow that will interest students.",Five things to watch at the Republican National Convention,UWM

Riseling will continue on to lead the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators.Riseling was the first woman and youngest person to become chief of a Big Ten university police force. According to the release, crime rate was at its lowest in 40 years during Riseling’s time with UWPD. In her 25 years as chief, she held various other leadership roles, including vice president at large for the International Association of Chiefs of Police. She also wrote a book, “A View from the Interior: Policing the Protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol,” and won numerous awards, according to the release.Riseling dealt with serious cases since the beginning of her UW-Madison career, including a crowd surge at a Badger football game, and worked to develop precaution measured for campus safety post-9/11. She also led forces to combat issues including sexual assault, risky alcohol behavior and more as these problems became more prominent in the last several years.Chancellor Rebecca Blank praised Riseling’s efforts for the UW-Madison campus.“I can’t think of a campus figure who has been a more integral part of our recent history,” Blank said in the news release. “Chief Riseling has developed a national reputation as one of the best campus police chiefs in the nation.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/06/uw-system-operating-budget-includes-segregated-fee-hike-for-students,"June 10, 2016 | 5:45am CDT","Segregated fees for students across the UW System will increase $59 on average during the upcoming fiscal year as a part of the System’s 2016-’17 operating budget, which was approved by the Board of Regents Thursday.The budget itself comes out at a time when state general purpose revenue is at an all-time low for the System after adjusting for inflation, according to System President Ray Cross.By the end of the next fiscal year, Cross said tuition fund balances will have decreased roughly 67 percent from their 2012-’13 levels.Julie Gordon, the System’s interim vice president of finance, explained that expenditures outweigh revenues in several areas of the budget, meaning the fund balances will continue to drop.The segregated fee changes range from a $4 decrease at UW-Platteville to a $259 increase at UW-La Crosse and are mostly comprised of funding for capital projects previously approved by the board, Gordon said.The remaining 30 percent of the fee is directed largely toward† student-initiated programming.At UW-Madison, where students will see a $72 hike in segregated fees over the course of the next year, $59 of that increase came from an Associated Students of Madison initiative to provide funding for University Health Services in areas like mental health and sexual assault prevention.Associated Students of Madison Chair Carmen Goséy said although she plans to be critical of segregated fee use and work to prevent it from increasing further, it is important to let students decide what they want to do with their money.Goséy said that if large increases like this one were to be asked for in the future, it would be a transparent conversation that considers the balance between student need and keeping costs down.“These aren’t unilateral decisions that me or the [Student Services Finance Committee] chair makes,” Goséy said. “It involves a lot of voices on campus.”Prices for room and board are also expected to rise system-wide. UW-Madison students will see a $203 increase for residence hall living, one of the steepest increases of all the System schools.UW-Madison junior Yasmeena Ougayour, a first-generation college student who pays all of her schooling expenses on her own, said she understands that the rising fees provide students with resources on campus but also acknowledged that they will add up over her years in school.“I think it is time for the Board of Regents to understand that these extra fees here and there may not seem like much right now,” Ougayour said. “But what about the students that have to work late hours and still excel in the rigorous courses that our campus offers?”The regents also voted unanimously to approve a request for UW students to receive more need-based aid in the upcoming state biennial budget.Funding for the Wisconsin Grant, an aid package that served more than 32,000 students in 2014-’15, has not increased in six years according to Bob Jokisch, the System’s senior policy advisor for financial aid.The regents approved a request to increase funding for the grant by roughly $19 million in the next biennium.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/06/becoming-comfortable-with-the-uncomfortable,"June 8, 2016 | 11:28pm CDT","In recent months, the debate over which bathroom facilities transgender people in the United States should use in public spaces has become one that has divided Americans. States such as North Carolina have already made up their minds on the matter, and have passed legislation preventing transgender students from using restrooms and locker rooms that do not match their biological sex. Even here in Wisconsin, bills similar to that in North Carolina have been proposed, and the discussion over them is widely thought to be opened again when session begins again this fall.In 2016, we as Americans will encounter a number of major events: There is a presidential election just a few months away, we are still without a ninth Supreme Court justice and the world has already experienced one major terror attack, with the constant threat of others always there. Yet, with all of this to face as a country, we remain with a heated and difficult discussion over something that will only make the lives of certain Americans more difficult. The targeting of transgender people through legislation is something that I find unacceptable, for I believe that we, being the United States, are supposed to be the welcoming home of all people, regardless of sex, race, sexuality, religion and or any other factor. Making life more difficult for people who are widely oppressed socially already, is something that I believe to be wrong. However, I recognize that bathrooms and locker rooms are dangerous places. There have been numerous instances in recent months and years that have shown this to be true. But these locker room and bathroom dangers are present regardless of one's sex or gender identity, and to generalize an entire population as ""dangerous"" because they may not be the same biologically as the other people in a restroom is something that I cannot accept. I am well aware of the startling statistics concerning sexual assault and rape in the United States, and for this reason I am not going to throw them at you in this piece. I would like to approach this topic from a different view,in terms of progress as a nation.The Daily Show's Trevor Noah recently shared his thoughts on these bathroom bills, and in doing so he brought up a point that has resonated with me. Noah acknowledged the dangers of bathrooms and locker rooms. He recognized that this is a situation and a topic that makes many people uncomfortable, and he certainly did not deny people their right to their beliefs, but his resonating point was that progress is something that always makes people uncomfortable. In his segment, which lasted a little more than seven minutes, he used a mix of comedy and seriousness to get his point across. And it is upon this point, that I would like to build.Imagine it is July 2, 1964, one of the most important days in American history; Congress has just passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, outlawing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. No longer were schools going to be segregated, nor the workplace nor public facilities. This was a day that had to have made every American a little uncomfortable. Regardless of whether you supported the act or not, everyday American life was changing in almost all aspects, and this is something people are never totally comfortable with. But as a society we became comfortable with it, and because of our comfort with the uncomfortable, our nation flourished and grew into the great country we now live in.Go back even further, to Aug. 18, 1920. The 19th amendment was ratified on this day—42 years after it was originally proposed by Sen. Aaron A. Sargent—preventing any U.S. citizen from being denied the right to vote based on sex. Our country once again found itself in unfamiliar waters. Women now had the power to participate in a world that once only belonged to men: the world of government. And this has been proven to be, yet again, a most important day in American history. Sargent overcame his discomfort, and we as a society overcame our discomfort, and we are only better because of it nearly 100 years later, as women serve as some of our most important and best political officers.You should not ignore the statistics about sexual assault and rape. Nor should you disregard the dangers of locker rooms and bathrooms. But you should allow yourself to have an open mind. Think back to a time in your life when you were uncomfortable. Think about how good it felt when you got past it. Now try to imagine what it would have been like to potentially live in constant discomfort because of who you are. Imagine not being able to go to the restroom without having at least a hint of doubt or worry about doing so. I'm not asking you to change who you are. I'm asking you to remain open-minded. To not make the lives of transgender people any more uncomfortable than they may or may not be already. I'm asking you to show your true colors as an American and support all people of this nation.My point is this: Become comfortable with the uncomfortable, because it is the first step toward progress.Jack is a sophomore intending to major in journalism and political science.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/05/uw-madison-chapter-of-fraternity-suspended-for-hostile-discriminatory-behavior,"May 19, 2016 | 11:54pm CDT","UW-Madison’s chapter of the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) has been suspended until Nov. 1, 2016.The suspension is a result of a complaint issued by a student member accusing the fraternity of having a “hostile, discriminatory environment,” according to a UW-Madison news release. The Committee on Student Organizations received the complaint March 3 and held the deciding hearing April 29. The final decision was made May 17, following an investigation of SAE that was conducted April 8, one month after the fraternity was informed of the allegations.The report claims numerous members of SAE repeatedly used “slurs, jokes, and derogatory language directed at racial minorities, religions and sexual orientations.” The accusing member also stated in the report that a member of SAE was physically assaulted by other members in an act of racial discrimination. According to the report, the assault occurred in fall 2014, which is when the verbal acts of discrimination also began.CSO voted and determined that the Greek chapter violated codes two and four of the Registered Student Organization Code of Conduct. According to the release, the fraternity attempted to “take action in response to certain complaints of the member,” which included the expulsion of a member who yelled racial slurs in the fraternity’s house, but these efforts were not sufficient. Despite action taken by the organization’s leadership, according to CSO’s investigation, the derogatory behaviors continued. Three pieces of evidence from the initial report and interviews of witnesses, who were mainly unidentified SAE members, provided information for CSO’s conclusion.Suspension prohibits the fraternity from participating in Greek community events, performing fall recruitment and exercising privileges of an RSO. Members will be required to participate in training that will combat similar issues; 100 percent attendance is mandatory in order for the trainings to be considered complete. SAE does, however, have the right to make an appeal to the Division of Student Life within 10 days of receiving the notice from CSO.Chancellor Rebecca Blank wrote in a letter to the executive director of SAE, Blaine Ayers, May 17, that she is “deeply disappointed in the chapter’s failure to address persistent reports of discriminatory behavior, as well as the national body’s inability to address discrimination within its chapters.” The “failure” refers to a video posted online March 7, 2015 by the SAE chapter at the University of Oklahoma that showed members singing racist chants. This particular chapter was closed after the incident, but, according to Blank, incidents persist and have not been adequately addressed.Blank stated the necessity for the national organization to lead the Wisconsin chapter in the newly required diversity and inclusion training. She requested a meeting with Ayers and the UW-Madison chapter president before lifting the suspension to ensure preventative action will be taken against further occurrences of similar issues.The SAE national headquarters responded with a statement, saying, “We disagree with the university president’s observation that Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s national organization has an inability to address discrimination in our chapters. In fact, the fraternity has enacted a large number of initiatives in the past year to combat intolerance, discrimination or morally unacceptable behavior.”The statement offered information on a “four-pronged initiative to address diversity and inclusion” that was given to all chapters and required training from all national members. It also mentions the hiring of a woman, Ashlee Canty, as director of diversity and inclusion.SAE was on probation with alcohol restriction at the time of the report that was to end May 13, 2016, and a general probation that would last until Dec. 19, 2016. This was taken into consideration by CSO in addition to the recent RSO Code of Conduct violations to determine the fate of the fraternity.The group will continue to be held on general probation until May 31, 2017, which requires the organization to comply with university rules and regulations and follow other standards set for them during the probationary period in order to remain an RSO.UPDATE May 19 11:30 p.m.: This story has been updated to include additional details from official university documents.

Two of the most prominent incidents involved a Native American healing circle outside of Dejope Residence Hall being mocked on March 9 and a student being spat on and shoved in Sellery Residence Hall on March 12. Following this, hundreds of students shared posts on Twitter and Facebook about their experiences on campus. Students raised awareness for #TheRealUW through several means, including bringing a banner that featured the hashtag and a Bucky Badger in a Ku Klux Klan outfit to political rallies when presidential candidates came to Madison. The movement garnered national attention from media outlets such as BET, Buzzfeed and The Chronicle of Higher Education.The student-led movement has prompted responses from several key university administrators on both social media and through official statements. Chancellor Rebecca Blank announced four initiatives in a March 15 open letter to the campus community, and she called for students to submit proposals to improve the campus climate for students of color. More than a hundred students submitted proposals.—Peter Coutu2. Wisconsin rejects presidential front-runners for Sanders, CruzWisconsin voters sent a message of disapproval to the presumptive presidential nominees of both parties on the April 5 primary. For Democrats, stung by defeats doled out by Gov. Scott Walker, strident progressives and students rejected Hillary Clinton’s moderation in favor of Sen. Bernie Sanders.Sanders held two campus rallies prior to the vote where students waited hours to catch a glimpse of the dogged socialist. “I believe his message, he tries to speak for middle class … and so I feel his support,” Jessica Kleinert said outside Sanders’ packed Orpheum rally.In the GOP race, Donald Trump’s march to the nomination hit a snag as Milwaukee talk radio hosts and Walker signaled support of Sen. Ted Cruz.Trump’s loss was not for a lack of trying. He crisscrossed the state, finding traction among struggling blue collar whites desperately gambling that through sheer force of personality alone Trump can revive Wisconsin’s rusted out industrial core.“Trump’s gonna bring his negotiators and tell [Mexico] flat out if you can’t do business with us at this cost we’re not gonna sell you nothing,” John Bly said at a Janesville rally. The former employee of a car seat supplier for the city’s shuttered G.M. plant added with anger, “[NAFTA] put us out of a job.”—Lucas Sczygelski3. Regents pass three tenure resolutionsThe UW System Board of Regents passed three tenure policy resolutions at its March 10 meeting amid systemwide backlash from faculty, who felt the resolutions failed to adequately protect academic freedom. The regents looked for an immediate replacement for tenure policy after Gov. Scott Walker struck it from state statutes last July. The resolutions outline a variety of measures surrounding conditions for tenured faculty and procedures related to financial emergency or program discontinuance in which layoffs would be necessary. Regent Tony Evers proposed an amendment in line with faculty suggestions that dealt with a specific line in one resolution, stating faculty layoff would only be an option in extraordinary situations where all other options have been considered. Evers requested the word “considered” be replaced with “pursued,” to demonstrate a more active commitment to finding alternatives. The amendment was voted down, however, along with two others that he said would better protect academic freedoms.Beth Lueck, president of the UW-Whitewater chapter of the American Association of University Professors, expressed concern that the policies were a result of pressures from outside the system. “They’ve created a problem and now are trying to solve it this way,” Lueck said. “I don’t think it will strengthen education or the UW System, I think it will hurt it.”—Madeline Heim4. Arrest of student leads to class walkout The UW-Madison Police Department arrested UW-Madison student Denzel J. McDonald, also known as King Shabazz, for 11 counts of graffiti on April 14. A UWPD officer entered McDonald’s classroom and asked him to step out of the room; McDonald was arrested outside of the building. His belongings were taken as evidence and it is unknown at this time whether he will be able to graduate in May.  The arrest upset students, faculty and staff. A statement was signed by 500 individuals that called for “immediate action from administration.”On the morning of April 21, approximately 400 students protested at various places on campus. They declared demands similar to the document. Chancellor Rebecca Blank and UWPD Chief Susan Riseling released statements in which they apologized for the disruption and committed to reviewing the actions of the officer. Blank released another statement after the protest that acknowledged the demands and thanked students for “fighting for a better UW.”—Sammy Gibbons5. Immigration bills spark protestRoughly 20,000 protesters crowded the Capitol in March, in a movement designed to show what a Wisconsin without Latinos would look like. The “Day Without Latinos and Immigrants,” the biggest protest seen in the Capitol since rallies against Act 10 in 2011, was in response to two bills that the participants said were anti-immigrant. One measure would have cut state funding from cities that don’t enforce immigration statutes in an effort to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities. After the protest, support surrounding the bill died after it failed to clear the state Senate.The other bill, signed into law by Gov. Scott Walker last week, barred local governments from issuing their own forms of ID. Businesses closed throughout Madison and dairy farmers in the state eased operations in solidarity with the movement. Protester Cerxio Guerrero said that most don’t understand the important role Latino workers play in the state’s economy.“Our economy would be ruined [without Latinos],” Guerrero said. “[Latinos and immigrants] work jobs that others don’t want to.”—Andrew Bahl6. UW schools release effects of budget cutsThe UW System released reports from each campus April 11 that showed the implications of state funding cuts to their respective universities within the past year. The reports detailed the elimination of certain faculty and staff positions, the decrease in funding for campus facilities and the reduction of resources available for students systemwide.UW-Eau Claire and UW-Superior reported currently having zero reserves and UW-Madison reported having an amount of reserves that would allow the university to operate for less than one week.According to the report, many university facilities are being affected by the budget cuts. UW-La Crosse’s Murphy Library was forced to eliminate many of its services during the 2015-’16 school year.The report also showed a 10 percent decrease in employees at UW-Platteville and that 94.7 percent of UW-Stevens Point faculty members are now being paid less than the national average.—Martha Morganstein7. Year after Robinson’s death brings activismDemonstrators marched all over Madison during the first weekend of March to commemorate the one year anniversary of the Madison Police Department shooting of Tony Robinson.Protesters started the weekend by marching Friday, March 4 from Library Mall to the Overture Center for the Arts. Then Sunday, March 6—the anniversary of Robinson’s death—protesters gathered at the Social Justice Center and marched towards the Capitol. They also held a vigil that evening.MPD Officer Matt Kenny shot and killed unarmed 19-year-old Tony Robinson after a physical altercation in 2015.Robinson’s mother Andrea Irwin, in addition to Young Gifted & Black Coalition and BlackOut, attended the protests. Colorful banners read “Justice for Tony” and “Black Lives Matter.” “If you sit there and say nothing, you are just as much guilty as those who are killing the babies in the streets. You have to use your voice to stand up. They have to make this stop,” Irwin said during the Sunday march. “It’s happened, and it will happen again.”—Ellie Borstad and Miller Jozwiak8. Legislature tries to fight student debtState lawmakers took up an issue this session that debt-laden students have known about for years: the rising price of a college education.Gov. Scott Walker touted a series of bills, passed by the state Legislature, that he says would keep college costs low. The measures included increasing technical college grants, requiring that colleges provide students with financial literacy information and creating a position in the Department of Workforce Development to help students find internships.“Student loan debt has increasingly become a burden for young professionals,” Walker said.State Democrats, however, favored a bill that would allow those holding student debt to refinance their loans. The so-called “Higher Ed, Lower Debt” bill received a hearing in the state Senate but did not move forward.The minority party said Walker’s bills didn’t go far enough to address the problem.“We should be doing something big, something bold,” said State Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, during floor debate. “Not these peanuts … that don’t do what our students need.”—Andrew Bahl9. UHS budget increases by $1 million for next fiscal yearUniversity Health Services will receive a $1.2 million budget increase for the next fiscal year as approved by Associated Students of Madison Student Services Finance Committee.This increase will be used to expand mental health and sexual assault prevention services, which have seen increased demand in recent years.A previous lack of funding resulted in wait times for mental health appointments around eight weeks.This increase will allow UHS to hire 12.5 new employees, which could add 6,000 more sessions to lower wait times.UHS also plans to hire more staff of color, which is a concern of many students on campus.There was some concern among SSFC members about approving the increase while keeping segregated fees affordable for students, but the committee ultimately felt the increase was worth supporting.“If we can just make UHS the most accessible resource possible, that would benefit all students,” Representative Erin Harper said.—Hannah Altwegg10. BlackOut protests Board of Regents meetingsUW-Madison student group BlackOut continued their demonstrations on campus by protesting two more Board of Regents meetings during the Spring 2016 Semester. The first of the semester occurred on Feb. 5. BlackOut was not allowed to hand in their demands to the regents, so they protested the meeting by yelling their demands.The group also issued a new demand, their sixth. The group called for UW-Madison to remove mandatory standardized testing from the university’s application process as it impedes access for low-income and minority students.BlackOut also protested the March 14 Board of Regents meeting, restating their demands. A UW-Madison student also detailed an incident of discrimination on campus where a Ho-Chunk elder was mocked during a Native American healing circle. A recent Board of Regents meeting held in Green Bay announced a task force assigned with evaluating the campus climate for students of color, which satisfied one of the group’s demands, though it was not necessarily in response to BlackOut.—Peter Coutu",Top 10 News - Spring 2016,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/05/editorial-boards-spring-retrospective,"May 2, 2016 | 8:00am CDT","Sexual assault climate Far too often this year, “sexual assault” appeared in the body of an email in our respective Wiscmail inboxes. Regardless of upcoming improvements by the university to the Tonight program and the work of organizations like PAVE and UHS, sexual assault remains one of the most serious issues our campus faces today. More than one in four female students experience sexual assault while pursuing their education here at UW-Madison, with at least 26.1 percent more going unreported, according to the Association of American Universities Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault Climate Survey—and the statistics are disproportionately higher for LGBT students. Also according to the survey, perpetrators were overwhelmingly identified as fellow students who are male, often a friend or acquaintance. Both administration and students alike are responsible for preventing sexual assault. However, at a certain point, it is not the responsibility of policy or the university, but the responsibility of our community as a whole. No one should live in fear while receiving their education, and creating a safe campus starts with all of us. If you see something, say something. Do not be a bystander. Political engagement in MadisonWisconsinites and out-of-state student voters alike helped make the April primary one of the most successful elections in recent memory.According to the state Government Accountability Board, 47.5 percent of eligible voters participated in last month’s primary. That is the nation’s second-highest turnout thus far, behind only early-season New Hampshire.Besides the presidential race, a number of important state and local elections were also on the ballot, making the high voter turnout all the more significant. Those races have a much more direct effect on community and statewide issues than a national primary.For Wisconsin voters, it will be important to keep this momentum through November, when 2016’s wild presidential campaign and another round of important state elections are decided. We have seen the power of political engagement firsthand on this campus, through protests, rallies and more. But the most direct form of political advocacy starts at the ballot box.LGBT bathroomsIn the wake of a series of controversial “religious freedom” laws and “bathroom bills” being debated and passed elsewhere in the nation, most notably in North Carolina, Dane County Executive Joe Parisi and Madison Mayor Paul Soglin stood up against LGBT discrimination and banned nonessential travel by county and city employees to states with such laws. Parisi also penned a letter to Gov. Scott Walker, asking him not to sign any similar bills in Wisconsin.These laws require people to use restrooms according to their gender assigned at birth and forbid municipalities from providing new legal protections for people who identify as gay, lesbian and transgender. They are oppressive to the LGBT community and are most harmful to transgender people. Local leaders’ actions in support of LGBT individuals are commendable and should serve as examples for the rest of the state to follow in the face of similar bills being proposed in Wisconsin. Cultural competency This past semester has seen an outpouring of students past and present sharing their experiences of hate and discrimination on campus, deemed #TheRealUW.Amid the stories of bias and advocacy for change, Chancellor Rebecca Blank announced—amid other objectives—the start of a cultural competency pilot program to begin in the coming fall semester. The program—crafted this semester through the driving force of Associated Students of Madison intern Katrina Morrison—will begin with freshman and transfer students, specifically targeting those living in residence halls. Dean of Students Lori Berquam said in an interview with The Daily Cardinal that there is no one best approach out there with cultural competency and that this program won’t be the be-all, end-all, but will be part of overall university efforts.While the conversation on race should not and cannot end here, the implementation of this program is a good start and a strong jump-start to further policy-based action on UW’s campus.Political protesting on campusThe tradition of student activism at UW-Madison has carried through this year, with protest culture remaining strong and vibrant: Hundreds of students participated in a recent walk-out, and #TheRealUW has garnered national attention through social media.While university rhetoric continues to push for more discussion of racial climate on campus, undergraduate student groups such as BlackOut as well as graduate students—a group of whom met with Chancellor Rebecca Blank recently to state three demands—are calling for action, not more conversation.Moving toward more than just talk requires student participation in creation of policy. Students have been integral in drafting the cultural competency program pilot, and even those new to campus have gotten more involved—a freshman drafted a mental health proposal this year. However, in order to encourage significant student involvement in policy, administration needs to do more than just assure students their policy contributions will be considered. Students should be compensated for their efforts, because although their voices are starting to be heard, they are not yet valued.The Tonight program, revisitedEarly this year, the Association of American Universities Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault Climate Survey evidenced some staggering statistics of sexual assault on UW-Madison’s campus. Concern sparked by the survey results brought many forums, discussions and promises of change to campus. Although there was an uprising of concern that came along with this survey, no concrete changes were seen on campus. Recently, however, there has been a promise of change to the Tonight program. Originally started in 2012, many students and faculty have felt that the current version is outdated for today’s climate. This change promises to become more conscious of students and be more inclusive overall. This can be seen as a first step to try to combat rape culture and improve the sexual assault climate on campus.",Editorial Board’s spring retrospective,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/04/dane-county-executive-joe-parisi-highlights-denim-day,"April 27, 2016 | 8:29pm CDT","Dane County Executive Joe Parisi and Rape Crisis Center Executive Director Erin Thornley Parisi held a press conference Wednesday in the City County Building to highlight Denim Day, which is meant to bring awareness to Sexual Assault Awareness Month.Denim Day first occurred in April 1999, according to the Denim Day website. The movement started after an 18-year-old Italian woman accused her driver’s education instructor of driving her to a remote road, forcing her out of the car and raping her.The case made it to the Italian Supreme Court, which ruled the sex must have been consensual because her jeans were so tight she must have helped take them off. Enraged, the women of the Italian Parliament showed up in tight blue jeans hours later.“We wear denim today to bring awareness to sexual assault and to dispel the myths that surround these crimes,” Thornley Parisi said at the press conference. “Denim is a visible means of protest against the misconceptions that surround sexual assault, the most common myth being that women lie about being sexually assaulted.”Parisi condemned victim blaming in sexual assault cases.“No other crime calls into the question the motives or the everyday being of the victim like sexual assault,” Parisi said. “About 50,000 Honda Accords are stolen every year. I’m not aware of one case of someone calling the police and reporting their Honda Accord was stolen and their response was, ‘Well that person must have wanted their car stolen because they bought a Honda Accord.’ And why we treat sexual assault any different than any other crime is a mystery to me.”The press conference also came after sexual violence prevention educator Dr. Keith Edwards spoke on reframing sexual assault as a male issue at Gordon Dining and Event Center April 6.“While most men don’t commit sexual assault, most sexual assaults are committed by men,” Parisi said. “Most sexual assaults are perpetrated by males. And part of wearing denim today is to ask men across the nation to think about how we can be a part of the solution.”Thornley Parisi also noted the GameChanger program, which is made up of high school students who work on different public policy issues. According to the Rape Crisis Center website, the program builds leadership through education on rape culture, primary prevention and bystander intervention.High school students Kenzie Thom and Hayley Baldwin attended the press conference and said they were working to increase consent education in their sexual education programs.“[GameChanger] is an amazing opportunity,” Thom said. “I’ve learned a lot. About myself. About consent. About everything, honestly,” Baldwin added.The Rape Crisis Center has taken 504 calls to its helpline this year. It has also made 136 trips to the hospital or law enforcement to accompany victims of sexual assault, which is 30 percent more than 2015.Newly elected Dane County Board of Supervisors Representative Hayley Young, District 5, said it is important to recognize programs need funding when they have increases in services, like the Rape Crisis Center’s increase in accompaniments.“When [the Rape Crisis Center] is providing hospital accompaniments, that’s at a time when someone needs the highest quality, sensitive care and response to sexual assault,” Young said. “We need to make sure as a campus community that we are supporting women, supporting men and supporting survivors with their stories of assault.”The Rape Crisis Center can be reached for services at 608-251-7273.",Dane County Executive Joe Parisi highlights Denim Day,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/04/therealuw-unhoods-enlightening-exhibit-at-chazen-museum,N/A,"Unhood Yourself: The Real UW One-Day Exhibition was gruesome gold. The stories told through various forms of mediums that included digital print media, graffiti, spoken word and visual art pieces told the reality that thrives on this campus today.#TheRealUW is a movement that began from a string of biased incidents occurring on the UW-Madison campus just this year alone. The alarming truth is that there have been at least 55 reported biased incidents, not including those that go unreported. The goal in mind of #TheRealUW exhibition is to bring awareness and conversation among different people in the community. With a crowd that drew in over 600 people, #TheRealUW invites the University students and faculty to talk about these issues and to express the same level of concern as the students that were victims of these biased incidents. Holding nothing back, the students are here to unveil and demand attention to the agony of being a person of color on this campus. No emotion or stone will go unturned; this time, the truth with be unhooded.This exhibition can be noted as the first of its kind. The Chazen welcomed the idea of having an abstract concept of visual art and performance to bring awareness to those that attend this campus. After #TheRealUW proposal was written and approved, the next step was the artwork. As I watched First Wave 9th Cohort members, Posse and PEOPLE scholars plan this entire show, the amount of work and dedication stemmed much further than just one night of performance. From screen printing to mannequin hunting for pieces like “#TheRealUW Reported Sexual Assaults,” Eneale Pickett has been a central driving force behind this entire movement.Performances varied from Tiffany Ike’s “Matter of Time,” to an impromptu performance from OMAI First Wave Artistic Director Rain Wilson. The lineup was much more than just the words on stage. Developers wanted people to take something away from this exhibit, to continue conversation past this small time increment that we are together. “You will not erase me,” Rain Wilson proclaims in a global affirmation piece that reassures us that we should build homes for ourselves instead of building foundations for an institution that is not here to support us. Wilson reiterates why there is caution in being of color, but why there is also more power in breaking from the chains institutions try to put on us.How can we move from these spaces of oppression into self love? Janetta Hill’s “CURAH” is a three-print collage that celebrates the idea “to care and protect.” Aside from the live screenprinting, Hill takes a new approach by making prints that everyone is free to take. As an onlooker, the foundation of “CURAH” may very well live past this one-day exhibition. After talking with Hill, she states her reason for the concept:“I wanted to share the lessons that I learned this year battling with depression and anxiety with others, not because these lessons are from a singular experience, but a collective journey. Watching people engage with and take my work felt like a silent conversation, a dialogue between our spirits and bodies. It felt like I was saying, ‘I see you!’ and they were saying, ‘I feel you!’ I hope a safe space was created on the page, a space where people can return to for assurance.”The impact of this show goes beyond this beautiful museum. It lies in the streets, in our classrooms and in spaces that we fill. The acknowledgement of what protest looks like comes in many different forms, and #TheRealUW does not limit itself to just one medium of expression.It is important to acknowledge the women of color behind this movement. No longer will we stand by and witness the erasure of black women, in any medium. Jamie Dawson, Tashiana Lipscomb and Synovia Alexis are revolutionary women. Not only are these women freshmen, they’re actively pursuing an education while balancing the duty of being an activist.This show was groundbreaking. To think that a show based on race would have a space in The Chazen Museum of Art, let alone Madison, Wisconsin is persistent progression. Further plans to expand and build this show are currently in the works. There is no stopping here. Having Buzzfeed, BET and The Huffington Post acknowledge #TheRealUW movement is just the beginning. The conversation will continue. The Unhood Yourself: The Real UW One-Day Exhibition is not about publicity, but rather is about existing in space. No longer will people of color be silent at this university. This campus needs a voice to remind this campus why none of its students are here on luck, but knowledge. We plan to educate this movement and take it beyond the realms of just this university. The protest does not end if we do not stop.Writer Francisco Velazquez was also involved in the event, as he presented a solo piece and was a part of a group piece with fellow spoken word artists Kynala Phillips and Kennedie King.

Scott Walker signed six bills Tuesday designed to protect state children and teenagers against abuse and trafficking.The legislation eases access to information on suspected Internet predators for law enforcement, expands sex trafficking definitions, improves child abuse investigations and increases resources for authorities and welfare agencies to locate missing children.Walker traveled around the state to four bill-signing events throughout the day, accompanied by state Attorney General Brad Schimel. The two began in Green Bay this morning and later made stops in Hudson, Wausau and Waukesha. Schimel has been a strong advocate of many of the enacted bills, including Senate Bill 325 and Senate Bill 546.SB 325, authored by state Rep. David Heaton, R-Wausau, and state Sen. Robert Crowles, R-Green Bay, establishes repeated physical abuse of the same child as a felony. The bill is modeled after a current law that specifically criminalizes repeated charges of sexually assaulting a child.SB 546—also known as Alicia’s Law—is authored by state Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc and state Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine. It authorizes the state’s attorney general to order subpoenas for Internet service providers to release information on computer users accessing child pornography independent of a judge. The legislation also increases funding to the Internet Crimes Against Children, a federal task-force program.“I have confidence the bipartisan bills being signed by Governor Walker today will make an impact on the culture of child welfare and improve the way the criminal justice system interacts with child victims in our state,” Schimel said in a press release.",Walker signs child abuse package into law,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/04/uw-madison-community-works-to-reduce-sexual-violence-on-campus,"April 18, 2016 | 6:00am CDT","On April 9, UW-Madison students received an email briefly describing a first-degree sexual assault that occurred just after 10 p.m. the previous night.Unfortunately, the message was similar to dozens of emails sent out earlier this year.UW-Madison participated in an Association of American Universities campus climate survey in the spring of 2015; its results were released the following fall. The findings exposed a statistic students currently know too well: One in four female undergraduate students experiences some form of sexual assault through force or incapacitation while attending UW-Madison.The survey collected data on the most common locations where assaults occur; on-campus housing and Greek housing were the two most frequently identified.Sam Johnson, a violence prevention specialist at the End Violence on Campus unit at University Health Services, explains prevention programs that target the two populations.Calling upon UHS for assistance, Greek leadership became determined to fix the issue, and the Greek Sexual Assault and Gender-Based Violence Task Force was formed.Students and some professional staff members primarily led the task force.As the designated violence prevention office for campus, UHS served as consultants for the task force, creating a plan with six recommendations to curb gender violence issues in the Greek community.Jimmy Benning, Psi Upsilon vice president and 2016 interfraternity council vice president of risk management, worked as one of 12 members to combat sexual assault in the Greek community.“The task force has kind of evolved,” Benning said. “Our first priority was to figure out how to make specific trouble areas safer, but now we have a bigger team that’s more involved in implementing what we came up with.”Benning worked with other members to present the ideas to Chancellor Rebecca Blank, who then approved them.The first recommendation requires bystander intervention training, administered by UHS, for all new members of Greek life.Greek students will utilize a program called “Green Dot,” which offers a curriculum for bystander intervention. It will also be used in classrooms and other organizations.“Rather than teaching people how to prevent their own sexual assaults or teaching how not to hurt people, this is what you as a community member, as a witness, can do to challenge and intervene,” Johnson said.The second recommendation created a new position in Greek chapters—a safety and wellness chair. This individual will be trained by UHS and be taught to provide assistance to individuals in their Greek houses.The Go Greek information session, which is open to all new Greek members, is commonly attended by sorority females, but prospective fraternity members rarely make appearances.The third recommendation involves a fraternity-specific information session to emphasize many topics pertaining to assault.“When you’re in an organization with lots of men, masculinity adds fuel to the fire,” Benning said. “There’s a lot of competition and guys coming in with misconceptions. That can be stopped with older members instilling values and telling them not to do those things.”Accountability also plays a role by amending Greek council bylaws and defining sexual assault while emphasizing intervention.This recommendation will likely be a component in the fifth point, which is peer-to-peer discussions that will be made mandatory for all general members.The final part of the plan promotes chapter involvement in gender-violence prevention. It encourages that six percent of active members participate in additional organizations related to sexual assault.Sexual assault is not exclusively a Greek community issue; it is a campuswide problem.UW-Madison attempts to train students about the situation early on by requiring the completion of the Tonight program by all new students.The computer program coaches students on bystander intervention techniques. Modifications are made every semester, using suggestions from student focus groups. Their biggest and latest improvement features more information on campus resources for assault witnesses and victims.“We are planning to increase our victim advocacy service,” Johnson said. “We are becoming aware that it is a needed service and are working on hiring more people to work towards prevention.”Along with the Tonight program and various student organizations raising awareness of sexual assault, the UW-Madison Police Department is fighting further sexual assaults on campus through highly trained officers and investigations centered on the victim’s comfortability.UWPD’s policies support victims’ control of police investigation and move at a pace that is comfortable for the victim, according to its website.UWPD officers also practice privacy and amnesty for drinking tickets to encourage victims to report against their assaulters and increase safety across UW-Madison.This is a key component of their current policies after the Association of American Universities found that 23.1 percent undergraduates nationally reported an experience of nonconsensual sexual contact, while 11 percent reported that they were raped, according to a Wisconsin State Journal article.UWPD, alongside Madison Police Department, believes the bill that gives victims of sexual assault amnesty from drinking tickets will prioritize victims’ concerns over university sanctions for underage drinking.“We need to do all we can to encourage survivors of sexual assault to come forward to report this crime, so we can do our jobs as law enforcement to hold a perpetrator accountable,” UWPD Assistant Chief Kari Sasso said in a State Journal article.But for any victims who are not ready to come forward to the police, UWPD and MPD do encourage them to see someone at one of the resources available through UHS or the UW campus.Benning and Johnson both said they see a positive change in the Madison community.According to Benning and Johnson, sexual assault is now being talked about much more freely, which is the first step to stopping the problem.“At the end of the day when I can actually see a change with my own eyes, when people go out on the weekends and start treating people with more respect in general, I think that’s the ultimate goal,” Benning said. “People need to realize that the survivors and the perpetrators are humans. Treat them like that.”",UW-Madison community works to reduce sexual violence on campus,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/04/letter-to-the-editor-uw-madisons-alcohol-culture-alienates-non-drinkers,"April 18, 2016 | 6:00am CDT","Hello, my name is Jonah. Invariably, when I introduce myself at weekly recovery programs I am greeted with a chorus of “Hello Jonah,” from a group united by our challenges coping with friends or family who have alcohol problems. I go because I am a senior at UW-Madison who is a non-drinker.Friends old and new ask all the time why I don’t drink. “It’s just a personal choice,” “I never have,” “I have a bad family history,” I usually respond.I rarely ever tell people—even my closest friends—what the answer really comes down to. I’m terrified alcohol would take my life away.Addiction is in my blood. It is the death threat I find etched on my mirror every Friday night.My great-grandfather is mostly responsible for bringing addiction to the gene pool on my father’s side. Nine of his 13 grandchildren became alcoholics. Most 20th century families descended on my mother’s side have struggled with drugs or alcohol. Genetics aren’t everything, but they contribute to about 40-to-60 percent of somebody’s risk of addiction, according to Joseph Glass, an assistant professor in the School of Social Work.Luckily, I grew up in a sober household, without having to confront alcohol. Then I came here. While UW-Madison’s drinking culture was never a secret, I didn’t know it was celebrated. Wisconsin is the No. 1 binge drinking state in the country, which for many is a point of pride. When professors make playful jokes about our wild weekend shenanigans, I smile—uncomfortably. When 14,000 students around me at Camp Randall are saying, “We! Want! More! Beer!” I close my eyes and wish I could disappear. When people who don’t know me expect high fives at 2:30 a.m., I oblige—there are better battles to fight. My private skirmishes began my first freshman weekend. I went to a house party where a cup of whatever was $5, which I would soon learn is standard in college. My friend and I weren’t drinking, and after we informed the makeshift bouncer, he scoffed as if his bravado were up to peer review and asked me, “Why would you come to a house party and not drink?” I bit my tongue and paid for an empty cup. We all make sacrifices to be accepted, right? Fifty percent of UW-Madison's undergrads are labeled as ""high-risk drinkers,"" according to University Health Services Alcohol and Other Drug Prevention Coordinator Reonda Washington. The American College Health Association defines ""high-risk drinkers"" as if you have had five or more drinks in one sitting within the last two weeks.Here come the “it’s college” clichés. Except other UW-System schools reported at 35 percent. The national average was 36 percent. Washington had a few ideas as to why UW-Madison’s high-risk drinking rate was 14 percentage points above the national average. One was our drinking culture. She also mentioned access.According to Washington, as of last July there were 206 places students could get alcohol within a 3-mile radius outside of campus, with one side of that radius being a lake. Eau Claire has 64 in the entire city. The drinking culture at UW-Madison is, at times, overwhelming to me. It can trigger the worst of my anxieties. I know I’m not by myself, but some nights at Wando’s or Nitty Gritty—where I barely have room to move—are where I feel most alone. People tell me I don’t need to drink because I’m fun without getting drunk. This swells my feelings of alienation. Research into the expectancy effects of alcohol illuminate the role our culture plays in the perceived connection between “drinking” and “fun.” People act more fun with alcohol because they think that’s what should happen, not entirely because the alcohol makes them do it. Diet Sunkist can bring out my most embarrassing dance moves, and it’s probably not due to the Aspartame. On the other side, to many, the absence of alcohol equals the absence of fun. “You’re not going out tonight? Why don’t you try and be fun? Why are you so boring?” In this environment, and in many others, alcohol is treated as a good. I question that. I in no way aim to condemn everyone who drinks, but I do ask for people to listen and be aware that something that may permeate society is not unequivocally good.How do we all reconcile that each year more than 600,000 students age 18-24 are assaulted by another student who has been drinking? That 90 percent of acquaintance rape and sexual assault on campuses involves the use of alcohol by the assailant, victim or both? That many surveyed UW-Madison students of color reported conscious attempts to avoid State Street and Langdon Street for fear of harassment? How am I supposed to reconcile that alcoholism wrecks families, that lives are over before they even start? I know alcohol does not make someone commit these crimes. But can you really say it’s not a factor?I’ve come to a point where I see there are people, good people, who can control their drinking behavior. And there are other people, also good people, who cannot. Not everyone fits the conception of an addict, someone who is “lying in the street, [who] smells like alcohol and is in the gutter,” as Glass explained.Respect each other’s limits and respect each other’s differences. College life is not all party and bullshit. I’ve said no to a drink many more times than I’ve Jumped Around. I believe there are others on this campus who choose to say no, who might even have a harder time saying no. For today, I’m not biting my tongue. I’m writing this for those people who may struggle as I do with UW-Madison’s drinking culture, who might want to know they are not alone. For me, every day is a fight. I have grown toward appreciating the sweet taste of Sunkist instead of the common alternative, one much more bitter in taste. There will be another note waiting, scrawled on my mirror next Friday, and the one after that. And I don’t know if it will ever get me. Hello, my name is Jonah.

Katz emphasized that the perspective of sexual assault is shifting. He said he believes these are men’s issues, and not solely women’s.“We need more men who are willing to take some of the pressure off of women, and who are willing to take some of the heat that some of these women get unfairly,” Katz said.Katz also discussed how men’s lives have improved because of feminist women’s leadership.“Women’s leadership has made all of the things that have been happening in the last several decades, in terms of transforming our cultural conversation,” Katz said. “Nothing like rape crisis centers existed until strong, smart, courageous women, with some male allies, built it.”The language used while discussing sexual assault may be confusing, according to the speaker. The controversy between calling people affected by assault “victims” or “alleged victims” is an issue frequently discussed among journalists and support systems. The term “accuser” is more often used, which Katz said is a step in the wrong direction.“It’s how power functions,” Katz said. “One of the challenges for those of us who want to shift the paradigm, it’s a struggle because the very language we use to conceptualize the world is, itself, stuck in the paradigm.”Katz promoted his ideas of men using leadership to put a stop to sexual assault. He described his program called the “bystander approach” that involves using individuals around perpetrators and victims.“There’s all kinds of ways that men and women need to figure out that within their peer culture they can be a person of integrity who doesn’t tolerate abusive behavior or language and not just intervening at the point of attack,” Katz said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/04/we-all-must-act-to-prevent-sexual-assault,"April 14, 2016 | 8:00am CDT","Women’s issues. Sexual assault is a women’s problem. Why are so many women being sexually assaulted? Why don’t we educate women on how to protect themselves?Do you see a problem with those statements? At no point was the focus on men. Not at one point did we address the fact that gender-based violence is not only a “women’s problem,” but also a male’s.Placing a problem on a singular group of people gives the other group a reason to ignore it. If we start by saying that gender-based violence is only a women’s issue and we need to teach women how to be safe, we are simply victim blaming. We are giving men a reason to ignore the issue completely. We are giving them an out. Men are seeing this problem as something they don’t need to be concerned with because it is labeled as a women’s issue.The problem with all these sentiments is the fact that they are not new. Everything I just said is not groundbreaking news. Women have been saying this for centuries, and we are lucky for that. We are lucky to live in a society that has so many powerful female figures. The issue is that men don’t listen.Men don’t listen to these women because these women are feminists. Even typing the word, I can imagine some men will cringe at just the sight of it. Some men hear the word feminist and roll their eyes because they believe feminists are just male-bashing, men-hating, crazy hippies. And by categorizing them as such, we feel safer just telling them to sit down and shut up because “feminism is about equality of genders, and you can’t hate on men if you’re a real feminist.”These women aren’t male-bashing, they are telling the truth. And by telling them to sit down and shut up, we are just perpetuating the idea that men don’t need to think about gender-based violence because it’s a “women’s issue.” Except it’s not—men need to start realizing that gender violence is a men’s issue, and we are the ones that need to change.Even in the case of sexual assault of males we see men absolving themselves of responsibilty. A lot of men like to use the argument that “men get assaulted too,” which they do, and it is something important that needs to be addressed. Except here’s the problem: It’s still a men’s issue. According to livingwell.org, the majority of sexual assaults against men are committed by heterosexual men. So even when men are the victims, they are usually the perpetrators.Recently we saw the rise of #NotAllMen, a hashtag used by men to defend the fact that not all men participate in gender-based violence. The problem with this hashtag is the fact that women already know this. People are aware that not every single man partakes in gender-based violence, but they also can’t tell the difference between someone who does and someone who doesn’t.Take me for example: I am a 6-foot-5 white male. On multiple occasions when I have been walking home late from a friend’s house or the library, I have seen women also walking home alone. Many of these times they have either crossed the street or visibly looked on edge because I, a large male, was walking behind them. These are not the situations that men should be angry about. In this situation it is only obvious to me that I am not going to assault these women. I shouldn’t be angry at them for glancing over their shoulder at me; instead I should be angry that we as a culture have made being a woman and walking home alone at night such a daunting and frightening task.Taking that into account, we can now see that men should have a direct interest in solving the issue of gender-based violence, and it’s one of the reasons we need to start speaking out. Jackson Katz, an American educator, coined something called “the bystander approach.” What Katz is trying to do with this approach is change the male culture, change the way that we interact with each other. Instead of hearing other men say something sexist and not giving it a second thought, we need to challenge them. We need to stop them, inform them, change how they see themselves in relation to gender-based violence. Katz says that we shouldn’t want to change this culture “because it’s illegal, but because it’s unacceptable and morally wrong.”Some men on campus have already taken a step in the right direction, starting with the organization Men Against Sexual Assault. But this issue should not fall on just their shoulders. It should instead fall on the shoulders of all men. We should all realize that there is something we need to start doing. Whether or not you have ever witnessed gender-based violence is beyond the point. The point is that you, as a male in society, need to change the way you see male culture and the stigma surrounding gender-based violence, and help change the way others see these things.My point is this: I understand that gender-based violence is a larger cultural issue, and not every man takes part in it. However, a lot of men think that just because they are not the ones jumping out in the middle of the night to attack someone they can just ignore this issue. No longer can we think like that. Men need to understand that there not only is something we can do, but something that we should do.Cal is a sophomore majoring in political science.

The letter did not include the names of the students involved.“I hope it's an honest letter,” said UW-Madison junior and co-leader of campus Native American organization Wunk Sheek, Kelly Holmes. “I hope that the letter truly reflects their experience.”The bias incident referenced in the letter occurred when students from inside Dejope Residence Hall mocked a Native American healing circle being held outside by chanting stereotypical war cries. The students’ chants interrupted a Ho-Chunk elder as he prayed and conversed with students during the healing ceremony.The ceremony was being held for sexual assault victims after a recent national survey revealed that 47 percent of Native American women at UW-Madison reported being sexually assaulted during their time on campus.Holmes said she hopes the letter will help the healing process following the incident.“It seems really rehearsed in a way, like not something that I would imagine students to say but as I mentioned if it's honest then it does help heal,” Holmes said. “If they really meant it then that's awesome, their recognition and advocacy would be great.”Holmes said she is satisfied with how the process has been handled following the official report of the incident.

But UW-Madison student and project team leader for Men Against Sexual Assault Joseph Janz said this is only the beginning for the organization.A small group of UW-Madison students founded the group last August, so they could incorporate men into the conversation of sexual assault on campus and involve them in finding the solution.Janz said the group has worked to create a place for men to discuss, take action and raise awareness against sexual assault.“Men have had a distinct role because they are seen as the perpetrators or assaulters, but we want men to have a strong role in finding the solution,” Janz said.The group is made up of five project teams that address sexual violence in different areas of campus, including the Greek chapters, athletics and residence halls, by using collaborative workshops, events and social media campaigns.Janz is currently working with University Housing to establish workshops in the residence halls for incoming students to raise awareness about sexual violence on campus and how they can be involved in the efforts to prevent it.“We put on workshops to start the discussion about [sexual assault],” Janz said. “And by bringing these conversations into their daily life, we can help others make a change and become better bystanders.”The workshops are currently being piloted through administrators of the housing division, and if approved, will begin the end of Spring Semester or beginning of Fall Semester.The group has already conducted workshops within certain chapters of fraternities and sororities, encouraging peer-to-peer conversations about consent and prevention.“A key component to us is peer-to-peer discussion,” Janz said, “because it’s more meaningful and effective when it’s comes from that peer connection.”Men Against Sexual Assault, alongside Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment, will host a lecture by Jackson Katz, author of the book Macho Paradox, at 6 p.m. Thursday at the Chemistry Building.

Scott Walker signed several bills into law today at various locations across Wisconsin, all of which deal with sexual and domestic abuse.“Domestic violence affects thousands of women, children, and men in Wisconsin,” Walker said in a statement.Two of the bills, Assembly Bills 615 and 643, clarify confusion with restraining order legislation. AB 615 requires courts to automatically send temporary restraining orders to local police departments for implementation. The other bill adjusts current law and updates the Department of Justice’s victim compensation program to cover expenses a victim may encounter as a result of the abuse.The two Senate Bills, SB 323 and SB 351, help “ensure Wisconsinites have a safe and stable support system through the recovery process,” Walker said in the statement.SB 323 helps give victims of sexual assault the right to have a victim advocate accompany them through the legal and medical systems. SB351 recognizes the 2002 Uniform Interstate Enforcement of Domestic Violence Protection Orders Act as valid in the state of Wisconsin. This act says that any domestic violence protection orders issued by another state or an Indian tribe have full faith and credit in this state, until the orders expire.Walker also signed a bipartisan bill known as “Safe at Home” at Domestic Abuse Intervention Services in Madison. The legislation requires the Wisconsin Department of Justice to give victims of abuse entering the program a confidential address to use for mailing and public records. This new address would protect victims’ location and safety.Promoting Awareness | Victim Empowerment, a UW-Madison student advocacy group dedicated to ending sexual abuse, praised the bills as “tremendous.”“PAVE feels that these bills are a step in the right direction towards making Wisconsin a safer and more survivor-centered state,” said PAVE Communications Coordinator Helen Powling. “PAVE is proud to see our state Legislature and our governor taking a stand with survivors of domestic violence and intimate partner violence in the state of Wisconsin.

Anger at myself, at men… at society.”One in four women on college campuses report surviving rape or attempted rape, Edwards said. He noted how this number has come up repeatedly in research, citing studies done by the U.S. Justice Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“You all know that men rape, but we don’t talk about it like that ... We ask women to respond to a world where this is the reality,” Edwards said. “When women are raped on a college campus, it is overwhelmingly men on that campus who have raped her. When men or trans folks are raped, it is overwhelmingly by men.”Edwards addressed the importance of “clear, unambiguous, freely given” consent at every step of the way when engaging in sexual activity. He said this consent it the only line between sex and rape.When someone is unable to give consent, or a situation seems like it could lead to a rape or assault, it is the responsibility of bystanders to intervene, Edwards said.“You have the power to stop sexual violence on this campus probably every weekend,” Edwards said.UW-Madison freshman Kai Pham said he learned a lot from the presentation, and now feels equipped to talk to others about Edwards’ message.“I think this really gave me some tools that I can use to reach the people who aren’t here,” Pham said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/04/sexual-orientation-is-not-grounds-for-discrimination,"April 5, 2016 | 8:00am CDT","On March 23, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory signed a law preventing local governments in the state of North Carolina from creating legislation to protect transgender and gay people. Based on a New York Times article from March 23, GOP Rep. Dean Arp of Monroe spoke in support of this legislation. He stated, “It's common sense—biological men should not be in women's showers, locker rooms and bathrooms.” The state Republicans in favor of this decision said that the major reasoning behind the bill was to protect the safety of women and children from “radical” action by the city of Charlotte in the state.This legislation was a reaction to the previously passed local ordinance Feb. 22 in the city of Charlotte, N.C. According to the Charlotte Observer, the city council approved LGBT protections by a seven to four vote. The protection law made it illegal for businesses in Charlotte to discriminate against gay, lesbian or transgender customers, in addition to the long-standing protections already in place concerning race, age, religion and gender. The ordinance was created following discriminatory events in locations such as bars, restaurants, stores and transportation services.However, the most controversial part of the ordinance was that it allowed transgender people to use bathrooms based on their choice of gender. This meant that males who identify as females could use women’s restrooms if they desired to. In an email, Governor McCrory responded to the change saying it would likely cause immediate action by legislators in the General Assembly.Many people responded negatively to the ordinance. One speaker at the hearing, Pam Burton, stated, “Please don’t discriminate against me and my children. I’m not scared of transgenders, but sexual predators will see this as a chance for fresh victims. If one child becomes a victim through this, shame on all of you.”As a result, the North Carolina General Assembly overturned this local ordinance in Charlotte when they passed the statewide legislation. This legislation excludes gay, lesbian and transgender people from the legal protection for discrimination in public places. According to a March 24 NPR article, this decision establishes a statewide nondiscrimination ordinance that explicitly supersedes any local nondiscrimination measures (the statewide protections still cover race, religion, color and national origin).There are a lot of misleading concepts embedded in this legislation that need to be discussed. The major concern that people against the LGBT protection bill raised was bathroom provisions. The argument they are making is that this provision will encourage sexual predators to enter the bathrooms to harass or assault people.This is something that I think is ridiculous. People will not be excused from committing sexual assault because of this law. They will face the same penalty as a person who associates with their biological gender and commits these crimes. No part of the law says it will protect criminals because of their sexual orientation. Bathroom provision is not about legalizing sexual assault or encouraging such acts, it is about offering protection to people who are in danger.In fact, there are cases of LGBT community members who have been violently attacked over using the bathroom of their identified gender. A report by newsnet5 Cleveland described that a woman in Detroit named Cortney Bogorad was violently expelled for using a woman’s bathroom in a restaurant. She said, “As I came out of the stall, this gentleman - who was a security guard - came in the bathroom, and before I was even completely out of the bathroom he grabbed me by the arms and pushed me up against the wall, told me that boys aren’t allowed in this restroom.”The North Carolina law is taking a step backward. It encourages discrimination against the LGBT community in the workplace, housing contracts, public utilities and shopping centers. Anti-discrimination laws are in place to protect people from acts of discrimination. All people in the United States should feel safe. Any legislation that suggests otherwise is something no one should be able to get behind.Hae Rin is a sophomore majoring in history.

Melissa Sargent's office, D-Madison, and Tenorio is a sophomore at UW-Madison.Young and Tenorio both responded to the recent issues of hate incidents on campus. Young said she would push for UW-Madison to actively fight these matters and apply “activist, political and media pressure,” while Tenorio emphasized his intention to create forums promoting open discussion for students.“Something tangibly I want to do is host forums here so we can continue this conversation,” Tenorio said. “Have open, frank discussions so that we can foster equity and inclusion and provide a safe space for all students.”Both candidates also spoke on sexual assault prevention on campus. Young said it is important to promote rape prevention conversations before the incidents occur.“The Rape Crisis Center actually currently receives no prevention grants from the Dane County Board and only receives grants that are dealing with response,” Young said. “Prevention is the most effective way to prevent assault on campus or anywhere in Dane County.”Tenorio also highlighted the significant role the Rape Crisis Center plays in providing survivors with assistance.“These aren’t just numbers, these are people, these are fellow Badgers on our campus, and this is something we need to change,” Tenorio said. “Through the Rape Crisis Center, this would allow for survivors to receive the proper counseling and resources that they need.”The candidates also discussed criminal justice reform and problems of poverty and homelessness in Madison. Young advocated for more humane treatment of inmates and promoted the foundation of a potential day shelter to provide resources for people experiencing homelessness.Tenorio examined the negative effects of racial profiling and the war on drugs, and stressed addressing the roots of poverty by increasing educational programs among the impoverished.Legislative Affairs Committee Chair Carmen Goséy underlined the importance of hosting the debate.“This debate is a wonderful opportunity for students on campus to hear the platforms of each candidate,” Goséy said in a press release, “which is especially important considering this position heavily represents the student body.”","Tenorio, Young face off in ASM County Board debate",UWM

The District 5 seat is traditionally held by a current UW-Madison student or a recent alum.The Board of Supervisors is the legislative branch of Dane County government. The position arguably has a more direct effect on students than federal or even state elected officials.According to the Knight Foundation, a private non profit that works towards informed communities, local elections significantly affect citizens’ cost of living through taxes. Yet local election turnout is one-third of presidential election turnout, which is already low at 60 percent.The board oversees, in conjunction with Dane County Executive Joe Parisi, the budget process. It also sets county ordinances, levies taxes and passes laws concerning law enforcement, according to its website.Tenorio is from Milwaukee and is the University Affairs Chair of the Associated Students of Madison. He is also an Army ROTC Cadet and a Private First Class in the Wisconsin National Guard. Tenorio said his experience in working in UW-Madison’s multicultural community qualifies him for the seat.“I worked with [the] Filipino-American Student Organization and Asian-American Student Union,” Tenorio said. “Working on promoting cultural awareness, cultural competency, that’s very big on our campus, especially with the recent cases of hate and bias.”Tenorio has multiple issues listed on his website, such as environmental sustainability and homelessness, but said racial equity and inclusion is the most important topic in this race.“I want to make sure that these criminal justice reform changes are being implemented over the next couple years,” he said. “That’s what I want to prioritize.”Tenorio also said Dane County needs to do an environmental impact analysis before implementing lake recommendations. His website says reducing pollutant runoff must be a priority because algae growth from phosphorus is “hazardous to our health.”According to the Environmental Protection Agency, algal bloom can reduce oxygen in lakes which kills fish. Lakes with high levels of toxins can make humans sick, but groundwater pollution can be more harmful at lower levels than lake runoff pollution.Hayley Young has been on the Wisconsin political scene longer, first getting involved during the Act 10 protests in 2011. She went on to be chair of College Democrats of Madison and interned in Representative Melissa Sargent’s office (D-Madison) where she is now a legislative aid. Young is also a graduate of Emerge Wisconsin, a program for future “progressive women leaders.”“I organized events like intersectionality panel, where we brought in focus on the LGBT Campus Center, or the Women’s Health Panel,” Young said. “I really spent my entire time on campus educating and engaging students on issues that impacted them. I bring a track record of making changes in margins and bringing people together to affect change in their community.”Young also lists the environment and homelessness as issues on her website in addition to safety. For Young, the most important issue is also racial equality.“If you have read the most recent reports the county has released, that is the most pressing issue,” Young said. “If you look at what’s even going on on campus, what’s being reinforced, is how important it is to address [racial disparity] issues.”Young also said as a part of the safety issue, she wants to increase funding to the Dane County Rape Crisis Center. According to a 2013 report, the center took in over $700,000 in revenue that year, which includes donations from citizens and organizations.The center is located on the south side and has a location in East Campus Mall. UW-Madison released a statement in January detailing efforts to reduce sexual assault on campus.Both candidates have endorsements from various local officials and organizations, and both list incumbent Leland Pan as endorsing them. Pan could not be reached for comment.In addition, both candidates’ emphasis on racial equality coincides with Blind Side, a political group that focuses on diversity and underrepresented students, winning 19 ASM seats.The election is April 5, the same day as the Wisconsin presidential primary and Supreme Court race.","Current UW student, recent grad square off in local election",UWM

Scott Walker’s college affordability package.College affordability package heads to Walker’s deskThe body approved the four bills, designed to help reduce the cost of higher education in Wisconsin, despite the pleas of Democrats who continue to maintain that they don’t do enough.The measures approved would increase technical college grants, require colleges provide students with financial literacy information and fund two positions in the Department of Workforce Development to help students secure internships.The centerpiece of the package, unveiled by Walker in his State of the State address in January, was not taken up by the state Senate. The bill would remove the cap on how much student loan borrowers can deduct interest payments from their taxes. According the Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, the measure’s cost of over $5 million is too expensive in the state's current budget climate.Despite the changes, members praised the bills as an attempt to help ensure that college remains affordable for students.“We’ve listened a lot tonight about the things we aren’t doing,” said state Sen. Richard Gudex, R-Fond du Lac. “I wish we could have done more but I’m going to take what we can get … and hopefully next time around there will be more to come.”Democrats said the bills affect a small minority of students and need to be expanded to actually improve college affordability.“A lot of the criticism is that this is window dressing, it was anemic,” Senate Minority Leader Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, said in the floor session. “Is this going to help refinancing? It does nothing for refinancing. We have continued to under-fund higher education and it's frustrating that … this is all we have. This is so pitiful.”The bills now head to Walker's desk.Sexual assault amnesty, new Board of Regents appointees also approvedThe body will also send a bill prohibiting drinking tickets for victims and witnesses of sexual assault to Walker. The measure has been praised by UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, UWPD and other officials as a way to increase the reporting of sexual assault.In addition, the Senate approved the appointment of two representatives, Bryan Steil and Tracey Klein, to the UW System Board of Regents as part of a mass vote of 25 other appointments.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/03/putting-the-spotlight-back-on-native-american-culture,"March 14, 2016 | 6:00am CDT","A little more than a century ago, the University of Wisconsin-Madison was a completely different place than the campus we walk today. In 1840, just eight years before the founding of UW-Madison, the population of the Madison area consisted of 99 percent Ho-Chunk, and a mere one percent of non-Indian society. In a recent interview with Interim Assistant Dean and Director of the School of Education Aaron Bird Bear, conducted by UW-Madison Communications Director John Lucas, Bird Bear highlighted the transformation of the area, saying, “there has been a complete physical and social transformation of Dejope from a marshy burr oak savannah with much less forest cover.” This is compared to the hustling and bustling that we see today. If this complete physical and social transformation of our campus area has only happened in the past 170 years, why do only a small percentage of students take concern with this issue?While UW-Madison does offer both a major and certificate program through the American Indian Studies office, students are rarely informed of the rich history our campus has with the American Indian community. The campus itself sits in the middle of the treaty-recognized borders of the former 10 million acres of land owned by the Ho-Chunk Nation. Not to mention that the Lakeshore neighborhood has Dejope Residence Hall and Four Lakes Market, which were the original names given to this region of Wisconsin by the Ho-Chunk Nation.Madison’s rise in student activism over the past year is something that our campus should be proud of. But it seems that we are missing a large portion of Madison’s direct history. Just this past week Madison saw an incident of racial discrimination against a group of Native American women. This incident took place in the Lakeshore neighborhood, the area of campus that is richest with Native American history. These women were gathered in a healing circle, spurred by the recent statistic that showed nearly 47 percent of current Native American women at UW-Madison had reported being sexually assaulted. While engaged in a healing ritual these women were interrupted with racially insensitive calls and chants.While steps were taken to rectify this situation, both by Campus Housing and the campus group BlackOut, the representation of the Native American culture on campus is something that needs to be addressed. More than 48,000 students attend this university, and a shockingly low number of only 300 students are American Indian and Alaska Native, which is only around .625 percent of this campus population.Along with this staggering neglect of culture, we also forget about the campus itself. The UW-Madison campus has the honor of being home to four Indian burial mounds, the most prominent of which are located on Observatory Hill. The Wisconsin Burial Sites Preservation Law (Wisconsin Statutes 157.70) protects these burial mounds from any “defacing, mutilating, injuring, exposing, removing, destroying, or desecrating” of the sites. A fact the campus seems to neglect, due to the fact that we have two sidewalks that run directly through the effigy mounds that call Observatory Hill home.Although these regulations are not strictly followed, Wisconsin burial mounds might not have any protection at all in the near future. A recent Wisconsin bill proposed by state Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, and state Rep. Rob Brooks, R-Saukville, calls for the lifting of protections given to some historical burial mounds. With Wisconsin hosting the greatest diversity of American Indian nations out of any state east of the Mississippi, we already don’t focus enough on these issues, and shouldn’t be moving to eliminate what few protections we do have of their history.Campus is taking steps forward, even recently educating the Campus and Visitor Relations Office, which is in charge of campus tours and information, on the campus heritage surrounding the American Indian culture. But that still isn’t enough. Instead of allowing students to continue to hold such ignorance toward campus history, we need to educate them. The American Indian Studies Office offers tours focused on Native American influence on campus, a resource that is rarely taken advantage of. If campus highlights these services, and students were to step up and use them towards their education, Madison’s student population could become both more well-rounded and culturally educated.Cal is a sophomore majoring in political science and communication arts.

But while the campus is popularly known for the public servants who started here, today’s students also represent themselves in government.The UW campus dominates two local districts in city and county government, regularly sending current or recent students to public office.“I think unofficially it’s always been a student’s seat,” recent UW alumnus and Dane County Supervisor for District 5 Leland Pan said about his current position.District 5 covers the UW-Madison campus, including most housing areas and about half of Lake Mendota.Since graduating last year, Zach Wood, City of Madison District 8 Alder, said he recognizes students’ integral role in local government.Both Pan and Wood said they owe their current positions to their time at UW. Pan, a sophomore when first elected to office in 2012, became known as a fighter for lost causes.“One major reason folks asked me to run is that I put in hard work for others,” Pan said, citing past campaign work like his role advocating for a Green Party member running for State Assembly. “I supported candidates who were really left wing with no chance of winning.”Wood had been active in the Democratic Party, eventually becoming vice chair of College Democrats of Wisconsin.He ran for office on a platform of improving public safety and combating sexual assault.Both approaches to office, one of firebrand progressivism and the other of activist party leadership, are not only hallmarks of the university, but of age as well.Representatives of the campus district, traditionally serving one or two terms, work with other officials who have been serving one or two decades.“You’re not expected to be in office forever, to bury yourself in bureaucracy and technical issues,” Pan said. “In some ways it’s liberating, you get to say what you believe.”Pan said, however, that “there is a level of, maybe, condescension” from some others on the county board.But respect among colleagues and for the campus district itself, previously represented by figures such as Tammy Baldwin and Paul Soglin, keeps students’ voices valued in deliberation.“District 8’s been a productive seat,” Wood said. “I don’t think I’ve experienced prejudice.”Angelito Tenorio, a UW-Madison sophomore and District 5 County Supervisor candidate, emphasized the importance of keeping young, new faces in office.“You can bring a new perspective, as opposed to sitting on the board for long periods of time,” Tenorio said. “Turnover is unique to District 5. People usually hold office for two to four years.”The campus district also has expectations for representatives’ ideals.“How activist-driven UW is really drives the reason why there even is this seat,” said Hayley Young, a recent UW graduate and candidate for District 5 supervisor.Young stated the UW experience affected her entire worldview.“You want to say ‘I’m an upperclassman or recent alumni’ and once you can no longer call yourself that you pass it on to someone in their early 20s,” Young said. “It’s not a rule, but more of a tradition.”",Students carry on tradition of serving in local government,UWM

A Ho-Chunk elder was also on campus for the healing ceremony and to educate students about Native American traditions. Dejope residence hall holds a special significance for many Native Americans on campus. The name translates to “four lakes,” which refers to lakes Mendota, Monona, Waubesa and Kegonsa, in the Ho-Chunk language.Several organizations, including the Wunk Sheek group and the Multicultural Student Center, helped plan the healing circle, which has both religious and cultural significance.Johnson said the Board of Regents need to hear about the experiences of marginalized UW-Madison students.“I think it’s really important to get a lot of different voices and perspectives when it comes to [incidents of discrimination],” Johnson said. “I was looking at the board and it doesn’t look very diverse at all.”The healing circle was held Wednesday night for the Native American women because of recent nationwide survey that revealed nearly 47 percent of current Native American women at UW-Madison reported being sexually assaulted.While telling the Board of Regents about the incident, Johnson became emotional and had to stop several times.“As a future educator I always have to have something written when I talk,” Johnson said. “But I really used this incident as my motivation and I just really spoke from my heart this time.”University Housing has begun a student conduct investigation to determine the students who participated in the incident. The Hate and Bias Incident Team is also looking into the incident, though currently the number of students involved is still undetermined.UW-Madison Director of News and Media Relations Meredith McGlone said the incident was “deeply disturbing” to both the participants of the healing circle and also the entire UW-Madison community.McGlone stressed that this incident “is not what the university stands for” and she encouraged any students with information about the Wednesday night incident to report it to kelly.giese@housing.wisc.edu.Updated at 10:46 a.m. March 11",BlackOut member details incident of discrimination during the Board of Regents protest,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/03/letter-to-the-editor-i-want-to-feel-safe,"March 4, 2016 | 11:00am CST","Just this past Sunday I took part in a privilege walk during the All Campus Leadership Conference. If you don’t know what a privilege walk is, it’s where everyone stands in a line shoulder-to-shoulder, someone reads off statements, and if you identify with a statement, you take a step forward. It’s meant to make people aware of their own privilege as well as how they compare to others in their community. If you haven’t done one, I highly suggest it, it’s such an easy and eye-opening experience. While these privilege walks bring up so many different points of privilege, I want to focus on one in particular that stuck out to me. Now first I should explain the demographics in the room. It was a group of ten people—nine were female and one was male. The moderator asked, “How many of you feel safe walking home alone at night?”Whoever identified with that was to take a step forward. When that question was asked, only one person in the room took a step forward. Can you guess who it was? It was the male student. All nine women stayed put without even a second thought, and the male student reluctantly stepped forward.That experience I just described enrages me. Yes, you could argue that our small group this morning does not represent the feelings or experiences of the general public, let alone the rest of the students here at UW-Madison, and that might be true. But nonetheless, what I saw today was a group of women, including myself, who all felt unsafe walking alone at night, and one man who could not relate with that statement. Even if that feeling is only apparent in that room at that time and does not represent the experiences of the rest of our student body (which I highly doubt), it doesn’t matter. It proves something so real that women are facing every day, or should I say night.I just want to take a moment to clarify a couple things. First, I am not a man hater. I mean I don’t think any woman is, but I certainly am not. All of the men in my life are absolutely amazing and I’m so thankful to have them. This article is not to say that all men are evil—of course they’re not. No one in their right mind would try to claim that. But there are staggering statistics showing how often women are physically and/or sexually assaulted by men, and I want to confront those. It’s not about all men being bad, it’s about all women having experienced some sort of harassment from men in their lifetime. Which brings me to my next point: This stuff happens to men too. Men are victims of physical and sexual violence by women, and I am not here to cover that up or paint it as a lie. It’s incredibly important and needs to be talked about.But for this article I have taken my small amount of words and chosen to talk about my personal experiences as a woman and what I’ve learned other women experience as well. Being a woman, especially in a college town where drinking is so prevalent, requires extra thinking and care. Just the act of being out late at night can involve a lot of thinking and planning— “Who am I going to be with?”, “Do those people live close to me so I could walk home with them?”, “If they don’t live close, would someone be willing to walk with me?”, “But that person can’t be another woman, because then who is going to walk her home?”, “Could I take a bus that drops me off close enough to my house?” “I might have to stay out later if no one wants to leave when I do”, and so many more. These thoughts go through my head every time I am going somewhere at night because I am simply not comfortable with walking home alone.And these are also questions that most of my friends who are women have to think about as well. Just to be able to be out at night for whatever reason we choose, women must have an action plan of how to get home in the safest way possible. This simply isn’t something that most men have to think about.I wanted to finish by lightening things up a little bit with a quote from a comedian, but while he is a comedian, Louis CK’s statement from his standup routine on dating is anything but funny to me: “There is no greater threat to women than men. We’re the number one threat to women—globally and historically—we are the number one cause of injury and mayhem. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them.”Briana is a junior studying community and nonprofit leadership with a certificate in gender and women’s studies.

Public outcry has mounted after a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel investigation alleging that workers at the Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake juvenile facilities committed acts of abuse, sexual assault and intimidation of inmates.The scandal has forced the resignation of former Corrections Secretary Ed Wall, and over a dozen prison staffers have been placed on leave.Lawmakers said in the letter that an audit of the DOC would hold staff accountable, as well as provide a plan for future reforms within the state prison system.“The situation can no longer be ignored,” the letter said. “An audit … would bring much-needed transparency and equally important recommendations for corrective actions and stronger safety measures to address this growing crisis.”The letter comes after several Democratic members of the Assembly Committee on Children and Families tried to force a discussion of the controversy last week during a hearing on the annual child abuse report.Committee Chair Jessie Rodriguez, R-Oak Creek, decried the hearing as an attempt by Democrats to score political points.“Committee members were aware of the agenda a full week prior to the hearing, and had ample time to contact the chair and request items be added to the agenda,” Rodriguez said in a statement. “None of the democratic members of the committee contacted me or my office to request a discussion of the incidents at Lincoln Hills be added to the agenda.”Democrats allege that documents obtained by the Journal Sentinel show that Gov.

How did you react when you read that? Did it make you uncomfortable? Angry? Confused? Did you blink or furrow your eyebrows? Or did you notice that you did not react at all?When I heard these words spoken in the hallway, I flinched. I blinked pretty furiously, took a shorter step, but nonetheless kept walking. Why was my reaction so minimal? How is it possible that a word with such a horrific meaning did not startle me in that moment? I reacted the same way one might when a professor throws out the f-bomb—slight discomfort, but virtually not impacted.As students at UW, we are alerted with emails each semester reporting cases of sexual assault. Every case is quickly relayed to the student body, and the emails seem to have been piling up recently. So, we begin to expect it. It becomes part of routine. So, my lack of reaction when I heard someone say that they were “raped” by an exam is possibly best explained by such familiarity and regularity.This comparison is preposterous. The impact that sexual assault leaves on its victims is chronic and devastating. The feeling you experience when you are leaving an exam room is in no way comparable to having been physically disrespected so intensely. When you leave your exam room, you will go home, blow off some steam with friends and continue your life. The temporary stress that you felt from the test will pass. It will not haunt your mind for the rest of your life, nor will it follow you into your future relationships with people.The idea of comparing an exam to sexual assault is not only absurd, but the casual use of the vernacular associated with sexual assault causes the issue to be seen in a different light. We have grown accustomed to hearing the word “rape” in completely unrelated contexts. It has become much too integrated in everyday dialogue. As we have become more familiar to the word, it is taken less seriously. Using it in said context reduces the meaning of the word to earning a less than desirable grade on an exam. We subconsciously begin to understand the word in this casual definition. It no longer makes us cringe. We understand it to be common.I can’t say that sexual assault isn’t common. Nearly 28 percent of female undergraduates have experienced nonconsensual sexual touching or penetration since attending UW-Madison, and over 50 percent of students said they have experienced sexual harassment according to a survey conducted by the university in January. This issue is disturbingly common, especially since it occurs here at UW. People are assaulted and harassed far too often. However, it is not to be understood in this light.To you, it’s a regular segment in the news. To a victim, it is a devastating life alteration. When you use the word in this context, you are disrespecting the victims. Casting a casual tone over the topic only belittles the experiences and heartache of these victims. Stop tossing around this word. Stop minimizing the effects that these tragic events have on your peers. Be an ear that they trust, not a mouth that they fear.Marisa is a sophomore majoring in journalism. Do you agree with her that “rape” is a word used too often in our daily conversations?

Van Orman said it was “absolutely” a part of the proposal.With the budget increase, funds for sexual assault prevention and violence prevention would double, according to Van Orman, and UHS would have two additional confidential victim advocates for students to speak with after an assault.SSFC members discussed merits of approving the fund increase for UHS services in contrast with keeping segregated fees at an affordable level for students.Representative Erin Harper said she was initially concerned with the large increase, but that the additional services will be worth supporting.“If we can just make UHS the most accessible resource possible, that would benefit all students,” Harper said.SSFC unanimously approved UHS’s budget at $14,892,560 at its meeting Feb. 15.","SSFC Spotlight: UHS receives million-dollar budget increase for mental health, sexual assault prevention services",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/02/absence-of-emergency-housing-perpetuates-student-homelessness,"February 15, 2016 | 6:00am CST","The first time Brooke Evans saw the word “homelessness” related to higher education was when she was filling out the FAFSA (or Free Application for Federal Student Aid) in 2010, where it wasn’t well-explained and implied that she was not homeless, even though that was not the case.Evans, a senior at UW-Madison, experienced homelessness as a freshman at UW-LaCrosse and then after she transferred to UW-Madison in the fall of 2012.Upon her arrival at Madison, Evans said there were no resources a homeless student could utilize; emergency housing and explicit affordable housing did not, and do not, exist.“How does someone do everything right and then become homeless?” Evans said. “There’s this mentality that if you’re homeless it means there’s something defective, deficient, deviant or disabled about your decision-making or your agency. That’s not true.”Evans stated there is a generational and societal divide between how individuals perceive homelessness.According to Evans, the “lowest hierarchy” of being homeless is to be sleeping outside, completely subjected to the elements, sexual exploitation, assault and theft.However, Evans thinks that is one case, and on a college campus, circumstances can differ.“To be couch surfing is to be homeless,” Evans said. “Living in your car is being homeless.”Part of the invisibility of this demographic comes from a lack of data.The Wisconsin HOPE Lab, run by Sara Goldrick-Rab, has been the only organization gathering statistics for homeless students at UW-Madison and throughout the state of Wisconsin.Within a city of 250,000 people, an accurate measurement of homeless students remains largely unstudied, according to Ald. Zach Wood, District 8, who is also a UW-Madison alum.There are theoretical ways in which data could be collected, Wood said; however, the dilemma of homeless students and the lack of affordable housing is a relatively new issue that UW-Madison and universities across the country are facing.According to Wood, this demographic has only been brought to the city in the past couple of years.“Just because it’s brand new in the news doesn’t make it new,” Evans said.Wood said there are other universities that have on-campus student emergency housing, or that allow students to stay in dorms at reduced rates, but UW-Madison does not offer such accommodations.Carmen Goséy, a sophomore at UW-Madison and ASM Legislative Affairs chair, said if she was an out-of-state student from a lower socio-economic background, she would be hesitant to attend this university; tuition is incredibly high, and housing is a separate entity.ASM recently created its own food pantry, allowing low-income students access to adequate nutrition.But this action does not solely address the demographic of homeless students.Goséy said if there was an affordable option to live on campus it would be utilized. However, she thinks affordable housing and emergency housing do not coincide.“You have full-time students here. You have students investing here,” Goséy said. “It’s our job to help aid people’s success. It is up to the entire university to do this.”According to Goséy, raising awareness is the first and most important step in addressing this issue, which has been greatly underreported.Awareness exposes the circumstances homeless students face, and those who listen are morally forced to respond, Goséy said.Hayley Young, administrative assistant at Seventhwave and UW-Madison alumna, said homelessness among students is not something people ordinarily expect.Young is currently in the running for the County Board district 5 seat and said she hopes to address the issue of homelessness in Madison if elected.According to Young, what many students face is housing and food insecurity, where the plan a student has for tonight and the plan for tomorrow might not necessarily be the same thing.“We need to normalize the fact that people do have financial struggles in college,” Young said. “When we’re talking about tuition and when we’re talking about student loan finance reform, you’re having a broader conversation about people having a successful college experience.”Young emphasized the importance of utilizing the resources available for UW-Madison students in financial distress, many of which do not realize such are available to them.The ASM food pantry, Tenant Resource Center and Tenants Rights Organization are pillars students can access when in need of advising.Those resources don’t completely solve the problems students face; they are not all specifically aimed to students and they are not necessarily well-advertised by the university, despite the growing number of students reporting housing insecurity, according to Young.“It's not acceptable that we're keeping someone from being able to receive the degree that can change and direct the entire trajectory of their life because we can't come up with enough resources to make sure that they're successful,” Young said.According to Evans, professors have either approached her with concern or have detached themselves from her in fear of academic nepotism; she thinks administrators search for something about students like herself that somehow constitute them not being Badgers.But Evans addressed the belief that everyone who gets to higher education somehow becomes middle class as false.“We want more impoverished people to be in college,” she said. “That’s good for equality, but once they’re here you have to do something about them.Update: This article was updated at 4:25 p.m. to reflect that Evans experienced homelessness as a freshman at UW-LaCrosse, and then after her transfer to UW-Madison.

Joan Ballweg, R-Markesan, and state Sen. Jerry Petrowski, R-Marathon, the bill has been supported by sexual assault advocates and university officials, such as UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank and the University of Wisconsin Police Department.“This is something that we need to do to find a way to help those victims feel secure in coming forward,” Ballweg said in a public hearing on the bill. “To get rid of that barrier … this will go a long way to help.”The bill has broad bipartisan support and passed the Assembly on a voice vote with no debate.The body also approved a bipartisan measure that would increase compensation for the wrongly convicted.The bill, authored by state Reps. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, Gary Hebl, D-Sun Prairie, and state Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, would increase the compensation cap to $1 million. Present law only allows for payments of $5,000 a year for a maximum of $25,000.Kooyenga said that while the bill cannot deliver justice to those wrongly convicted of crimes, it does help improve the criminal justice system as a whole.""As a legislative branch,"" Kooyenga said, ""we should continue to work to move our great justice system into a greater justice system.""More controversially, the Assembly passed a measure that would change regulations and zoning for land near waterways 57-39.

She took two sips of a drink before she began to feel “dizzy, hazy, and uncomfortable,” according to a UW-Madison crime warning.The unknown man walked her home, where she passed out. She reported that she woke up as she was being sexually assaulted.UWPD learned about the reported sexual assault on Friday but, as the alleged crime was not disclosed to any law enforcement agency, no criminal investigations are ongoing.“She chose to tell another person who happens to be a campus security authority,” said UWPD Public Information Officer Marc Lovicott. “By obligation, by law, that campus security authority does have to file a report with the University to disclose this information.”The victim reported the sexual assault to campus security authority Friday, a day after a bill unanimously passed an Assembly committee that would eliminate underage drinking tickets for victims and witnesses of sexual assaults. UWPD has had the Responsible Actions Guidelines for five years, which already enforces on campus what the bill is proposing.Lovicott hopes the bill will remove the barrier of underage drinking for sexual assault victims choosing to report the crime.“The bill that is going to the Legislature right now we think and we hope will remove one barrier of individuals deciding not to come forward,” Lovicott said. “There are many reasons why someone might decide not to report.

Scott Walker in his State of the State address, would provide a tax break for some borrowers paying back their student loans, expand funding for technical college students' financial aid, help connect students with internships, fund emergency financial aid covering unexpected expenses and require colleges provide financial literacy training.Republicans say about 32,000 people will benefit from the tax proposal, which eliminates the $2,500 deduction cap borrowers can claim for their student loan interest. In addition, 500 technical college students are expected to become beneficiaries of the increased funding for need-based grants every year.Democrats proposed numerous amendments to the bills, which were struck down on party line votes. State Rep. Dana Wachs, D-Eau Claire, said the Republican bills did not go far enough to address the student debt problem, which is why no member of his caucus voted for the measures.""Student loan debt is holding back our economy, and our proposals to invest in our students and schools—while lowering monthly payments for borrowers—will boost the middle class and small businesses by putting more money into the pockets of hardworking Wisconsinites,"" Wachs said in a press release.He also touted a Democratic proposal authored by state Rep. Cory Mason, D-Racine, and state Sen. Dave Hansen, D-Green Bay, which would create a state-run agency to help students refinance their loans.“There is only one real solution to providing relief to the one million Wisconsinites with student loan debt – the Democratic ‘Higher Ed, Lower Debt’ proposal, a common-sense, popular plan that will grow our economy and our middle class,” Wachs said in the statement.Both Walker and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, are confident the package of bills will be passed before legislative session ends in the spring.Sexual assault amnesty measure also passesA bill that would provide amnesty from drinking tickets for victims and witnesses of sexual assault also passed an Assembly committee unanimously Thursday.The proposal, authored by state Rep. Joan Ballweg, R-Markesan, is supported by UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, the UW-Madison Police Department and state Attorney General Brad Schimel.Ballweg said in her testimony that the bill removes a key barrier to reporting sexual assault cases.“This is something that we need to do to find a way to help those victims feel secure in coming forward,” Ballweg said. “To get rid of that barrier … this will go a long way to help.”While some lawmakers raised questions as to who would be considered a bystander under the bill, numerous members of the Assembly Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety expressed verbal support for the bill and it cleared the committee without objection.Ballweg added she hoped the bill would be quickly passed by the Legislature, despite the bill’s late introduction and statements by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, that he hopes to wrap up his chamber’s session by late February.","College affordability, sexual assault bills clear committees",UWM

Joan Ballweg, R-Markesan, and state Sen. Jerry Petrowski, R-Marathon, the Sexual Assault Amnesty Bill will ensure a “depth of convincingness” on a practice already in UW-Madison policy, according to Chancellor Rebecca Blank.Ballweg cited statistics on sexual assault from the 2015 Association of American Universities Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct, including low reporting numbers on sexual violence crimes. The report also found nearly 75 percent of victims had been consuming alcohol at the time of the assault.Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel acknowledged the difficult path for sexual assault victims coming forward to law enforcement, explaining that victims could face many questions, invasive medical exams and “aggressive challenges to their credibility and character.” He said this bill will remove one barrier by excusing victims and intervening bystanders of any charges related to alcohol.Blank thanked several campus partners for their work regarding the prevention of sexual violence, including the UW-Madison Police Department, University Health Services and the student organization Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment.Blank described UW-Madison’s own practices in these types of situations, saying victims of sexual assault and bystanders giving assistance are not subject to disciplinary action from the Dean of Students, University Housing or UW-Madison Police if they engaged in improper alcohol use like underage drinking.Blank also said the university has rolled out initiatives to inform students that the university will focus on the sexual assault and not on any improper alcohol use, but she said it would be helpful to point to a portion of Wisconsin law that implements this practice.Kelly Moe Litke, director of prevention and programs at the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault, also shared her support for the bill at the press conference.“It is only through the courage of survivors coming forward to report these crimes that we can hold perpetrators accountable,” Moe Litke said. “WCASA appreciates that this bill not only removes a barrier to reporting for survivors, it sends the message that survivors are not to blame for the violence committed against them.”The bill will have at least some measure of bipartisan support, as a spokesperson for state Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, who represents campus, said she has signed on as a co-sponsor of the bill.Ballweg said she hopes the proposal will have a public hearing this week and pass before the end of legislative session in March.

The curriculum will include information on where to report crimes and how to locate confidential support groups for victims.According to the release, Sarah Laudon, a UW-Madison senior in Pi Beta Phi, said that by implementing these practices, she hopes that long-term changes will occur in UW-Madison’s Greek life.“The reduction in numbers [of incidents] is important but it’s important to change the culture, seeing things change over time.”",Greek life task force looks to curb sexual violence on campus,UWM

Specifically, he has served as a Student Council representative and University Affairs chair with Associated Students of Madison, UW-Madison’s student government.With ASM, Tenorio focuses extensively on mental health, sexual assault and other student issues, which he notes would remain his key initiatives if elected to the position.Tenorio said he is interested in bringing affordable student housing to the board’s attention. Noting the low tenant-vacancy rate in Dane County and the consequently unequal distribution of power to landlords, Tenorio said he doesn’t “think students should be taken advantage of.”He said he also wants to work with city government to address the “increasing number of luxury high-rise apartments that [students] just can’t afford.”Additionally, Tenorio said he is interested in addressing the area’s homelessness problem, specifically the increasing number of homeless people on State Street and Capitol Square.“From a fiscal perspective,[the city] would actually save money if [it] funded a shelter rather than sending [the homeless] to jail,” he said. “But from a human perspective, it’s freezing outside and these people need our help.”According to Tenorio, the homelessness problem leads into the county’s problems with racial inequality, especially in the criminal justice system and mass incarceration rates among blacks.“I think we need to focus on alternatives to arrest and incarceration,” he said.Tenorio said he also wants to increase the county’s environmental sustainability efforts. He specifically names agricultural and industrial runoffs into the county’s lakes and waterways as a key issue, which he said lead to “phosphorus entering our water systems [and an increase] in algae growth.”Tenorio first became interested in running for county government after meeting incumbent Leland Pan through ASM, whom announced in December he would not be running for re-election.In order to get on the ballot for election, Tenorio had to gather nomination signatures by personally canvassing the District 5 area, which he said was an entirely new and exciting experience for him.The election will take place April 5.",UW-Madison sophomore to run for county board,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/12/read-the-top-ten-news-of-fall-2017,"December 9, 2017 | 6:12pm CST","In the history of UW-Madison, one could argue there has never been a ""dull"" semester on campus. The fall of 2017 saw the university's first concrete data on campus climate and food insecurity, new punishments for student protestors and increased crime. Sound like a lot to remember? The Daily Cardinal has you covered. Get debriefed on the top ten things that happened on campus this semester with our Top Ten News.1. Student protestors will face punishment under new Regent policy, following push from state legislatorsTwo Republican lawmakers introduced a highly controversial bill this past April to punish students who protest and disrupt speakers on campus. The bill, titled the “Campus Free Speech Act,” would suspend student protestors for a minimum of one semester and repeat offenders could even be expelled.A second bill extended the punishments to students who may disrupt speakers at technical colleges.The purpose, lawmakers said, was to protect all student voices — especially conservative students’ voices who felt drowned out by campus protest of conservative speakers.These bills sparked immense outcry from students, faculty and Democratic lawmakers.The trajectory of the bills, however, shifted from legislative action to a Board of Regents ruling. In October, the Board of Regents approved a policy mirroring the Campus Free Speech Act. The policy also required chancellors to provide an explanation to the regents if they choose not to expel a student.“Campuses across the country are wrestling with the question of appropriate behavior of students,” Board of Regents President John Behling said in October. “Through this policy, we inform students and taxpayers that we can provide a world-class education in an atmosphere where civility, respect and safety is required and expected.”- Lilly Price2. Results from university's first campus climate survey show not everyone feels welcome Following movements like #TheRealUW and years of students calling on the university to address the concerns of underrepresented populations on campus, UW-Madison released results from its first-ever campus climate survey Nov. 1.Results of the survey showed what the university “had long known anecdotally” — underrepresented students have a significantly less positive perception of the university’s environment. While 81 percent of UW-Madison’s overall student population often feel welcome on campus, just 69 percent of LGBQ students, 67 percent of students with a disability, 65 percent of black students and 50 percent of trans or nonbinary students felt similarly.Additionally, data showed that conservatives felt more welcome on campus, and that many UW-Madison students do not feel comfortable contacting university police if they have an issue. University officials said they do not plan to create new programs to address these problems, but rather plan to improve the initiatives already in place.Chief Diversity Officer Patrick Sims said the university plans to repeat this climate survey every four to five years. - Lawrence Andrea3. UW System's unexpected plan to merge 4-year universities with 2-year colleges upsets students, facultyThe Board of Regents passed UW System President Ray Cross’s controversial plan at their November meeting to pair two-year schools with four-years after declining enrollment at smaller institutions.In the fall, UW System enrollment dropped by more than two percent at half of the schools, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, resulting in an estimated loss of about 2,500 students. In 2016, this figure was an estimated 5,000 students, resulting in tens of millions of dollars of lost revenue.But the plan, which leaked in October, sparked outrage from students and faculty who were not consulted in the decision-making process. After the announcement, students at two-year UW System schools wondered how school activities such as student government and athletics would be impacted. Meanwhile, faculty worried about losing their jobs if the plan cleared the regents.Now that the plan has passed, UW-Extension will be under UW-Madison and UW System control. Schools will officially merge beginning July 1, 2018.- Maggie Chandler4. Changes to UW dining draws sharp student criticismNew students entering UW-Madison’s residence halls next year will be now be required to deposit a minimum of $1400 onto their WisCard, only to be used for dining.University Housing Director Jeff Novak said the change was necessary because of growing concern from parents and students over being unaware of how much dining is expected to cost. He said the new plan will provide a guideline so that students can hold themselves accountable.The plan received backlash from shared governance groups and student organizations across the UW-Madison community. Some students claimed the minimum deposit of $1400 — what Novak said was the average price a student spends — was higher than necessary. Others disagreed with the rule that money not spent at the end of the year would be forfeited to the university, and yet more said the plan does not take into account different students’ dietary restrictions.- Lawrence Andrea5. Chemistry TA relieved from teaching duties amid allegations of white supremacyUW-Madison relieved a graduate student from his teaching duties in October after a blog post, which claimed he was expelled from Oberlin College for racist messaging and currently belongs to a white supremacist group, went viral. The student, Dylan Bleier, denied the allegations.A Facebook page that appears to belong to Bleier is a member of the Madison chapter of the self-proclaimed ""Western chauvinist"" organization Proud Boys. Additionally, tweets and Facebook posts that appear to belong to Bleier call for violence against certain groups and include offensive stereotypes.“1488 gas the k**** race war now,” one tweet reads. “Kill anyone who wants to censor speech,” says another.Bleier left Oberlin College after he and a fellow student allegedly vandalized campus and area buildings with anti-Semitic and racist messages and distributed anti-Islam flyers in 2013. The vandalism spree made national news, with many sources calling the incident a “hoax” because he supposedly identified as a liberal and had volunteered for Barack Obama’s campaign.Bleier and the UW-Madison administration came to an agreement that he would no longer serve as a teaching assistant for Chemistry 109 in order to avoid classroom disruption.- Noah Habenstreit6. UW-Madison begins accepting food stamps This fall UW-Madison began accepting food stamps in the Flamingo Run of Gordon's.University Housing announced it would being the process last spring, and submitted an application to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Currently, the Gordon’s Flamingo Run is the only campus location accepting SNAP benefits but officials said they will evaluate the program throughout the year and possibly expand.The change came after urging from former Associated Students of Madison Representative Brooke Evans, who was food insecure herself. She urged the university to include questions on food and housing insecurity to the Campus Climate Survey which found one in eight students said they had trouble affording sufficient food and housing.Only campus convenience stores can use the program because all of their food is pre-packaged, the dining halls themselves will never be eligible for the program. - Nina Bertelsen7. Strip of bars on University Avenue see sharp crime increaseThe city saw an increase in crime in a popular bar district near the UW-Madison campus this semester — including some instances in which MPD had to deploy pepper spray to break up fights.The 600 block of University Avenue, which houses Wando’s Bar and Grille and the Double U, has become a focus for police. Some city officials said the area has become a center for “criminal gang” activity and local enforcement is having a hard time keeping up.City council members have tried to reduce crime through several initiatives including relocating late-night food carts, moving taxi stands and imposing stricter parking regulations on the avenue.Between Aug. 1 and Oct. 5, MPD opened 117 cases in the area, according to records obtained by The Daily Cardinal. About 84 percent of those incidents — all but 19 — occurred on the weekend. Most were at night, with about 70 percent happening between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.- Gina Heeb8. UW sees increase in reported hate crimes, mainly anti-Semitic incidentsResults of the UW-Madison Police Department's Annual Security Report showed an increase in reported hate crimes, with anti-Semitic vandalism the most prominent issue.Of the 20 crimes reported to UWPD in 2016 — an increase of 18 from 2015 — 14 were incidents of vandalism “motivated by bias against Judaism” and performed by a single offender, according to the report. Crimes ranged from spray paint on a wall outside the Jewish Experience of Madison to swastikas found spray-painted close to the Gates of Heaven Synagogue just off campus.Some students on campus said these acts make them feel unsafe on campus and need to be addressed. University officials attributed the rise in hate crimes to an increase in the number of incidents reported because “the system is more public.”  - Lawrence Andrea9. UW students accused of sexual assault see little time behind barsIn the last few years, UW-Madison students accused of sexual assault have received little legal punishment.At least five students were convicted in sexual assault cases between 2011 and August of 2017 with maximum sentences that could have totaled more than six decades behind bars. But in total, the five students served less than a year in jail — which is significantly lower than typical sentencing norms for violent crimes — The Daily Cardinal found.One student convicted of a felony sexual assault was not sentenced to any jail time. The longest sentence among the three UW-Madison students convicted of felonies in the cases was four months.Former student Alec Shiva’s sentencing in September broke the trend when he received 18 months in jail with three years probation for an assault that took place in his dorm last spring.Dane County’s sentencing trend sharply deviate from the national average in cases of convicted sexual assault.Nearly 90 percent of people found guilty of rape serve prison time, with 84 percent sentenced to more than 10 years, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics’ analysis of 2009 data on felony defendants from America’s 75 largest counties.- Nina Bertelsen and Gina Heeb10. State budget passes, solidifies increased UW funding with stipulationsGov. Scott Walker officially signed the 2017-’19 state budget into law in September, finalizing the $76 billion document and ending a months-long stalemate between Republican Assembly and Senate members.Included in the budget was a $100 million funding boost for the UW System with an additional $31.5 million tied to performance-based metrics — marking the first budget in the past eight state budgets that did not feature cuts to the system. Walker’s previous 2015-’17 budget axed $250 million in revenue from the system.Metrics require UW schools to perform according to a set of criteria that will determine their share of state funding. During the final budget negotiations, Walker partially vetoed 99 provisions in the budget. He rejected the ability for universities to choose their own metrics to rate themselves against, saying schools would choose metrics that would not be challenging to meet.- Lilly Price",Read the Top Ten News of the semester,UWM

According to documents collected by the Wisconsin State Journal and Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, in 2015 administrative judge Deborah Little Cohn found probable cause to believe that Williams’ complaints were valid.Coggs made several inappropriate comments and sexual innuendos about William’s breasts and sex life during her time working for him, including calling her fiancé gay, according to Little Cohn’s findings. Additionally, though both Williams and Coggs are African-American, Coggs told Williams that she was “not black enough,” wrote Little Cohn.In a statement Monday, Coggs claimed that he had no involvement in settlement talks and was fully innocent.""In over 35 years in public office, at no time have I engaged in or condoned behavior which could be viewed as harassment or discrimination with respect to the complainant or anyone else who has worked for me,"" Coggs said.Williams initially approached the human resources officials about Coggs in 2009, mentioning how other staff in his office would use binoculars to spy on women walking outside the Capitol, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Despite her complaint, no action was taken.Williams then made an official complaint with the state Equal Rights Division in 2011, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Differing from sexual assault investigations at the state level, the Equal Rights Division releases all investigation findings regarding these types of cases.This settlement, disclosed among many other national reports in the media in recent weeks exposing sexual harassment by men in public positions, highlighted recent objections about Wisconsin Legislature’s policy not to release any sexual harassment records.Leaders from both parties in the Legislature said they conceal their sexual harassment investigations in order to foster confidence among employees that the Assembly has the ability to resolve internal issues. Critics, however, say keeping investigation information private protects the perpetrator rather than the victim.State Senate Chief Clerk Jeff Renk and state Assembly Chief Clerk Patrick Fuller, who made the decision to maintain the holding of records, disclosed to the Journal Sentinel that there have been three other undisclosed complaints of sexual harassment made over the last 10 years.","Sexual harassment complaint against former Democratic lawmaker ended in $75,000 settlement",UWM

Stuck to the first page, he found a Post-It note with a list of women’s names written on it.Whether that notebook will be used as evidence when Cook stands trial remains up in the air, after Dane County Judges Stephen Ehlke and John Hyland postponed making any decisions at a motion hearing Thursday.The nature of the writing in the notebook seemed “systematic,” Humerickhouse testified, adding that he saw it and immediately thought, “this means something.”But according to the defense, police improperly searched and seized the journal by reading and taking photographs of pages inside. In September, they requested it be excluded from evidence in the seven separate trials Cook will face.The search warrant, which Cook also signed, said police could look for certain evidence including any women’s clothing, hair, sex toys, lubricant or condoms.“Is having a list of girls’ names illegal?” attorney Jessa Nicholson asked, noting Humerickhouse took photos of the journal without suspecting illegal activity — a condition of legal seizure without a warrant.Meanwhile, the prosecution argued Humerickhouse was following the plain view doctrine, a rule that allows officers to seize evidence out in the open during a lawful observation.Acknowledging grey area surrounding the evidence, Ehlke and Hyland decided after more than two hours of testimony to postpone the decision and issue a written order at a later time.“It gets to the question of balancing privacy interests of a person versus the reasonableness of the search,” Hyland said.The defense also requested a change of venue for the trials earlier this year.Noting the high-profile nature of the cases, heavy press coverage in the Madison area and the involvement of the UW-Madison community, Cook’s lawyers argued that a Dane County trial would be at risk of jury bias.“We have a really polarized campus community and it’s concerning,” Nicholson told reporters in September.The cases will be separated by victims and the type of charge filed, Dane County Circuit Court Judge Stephen Ehlke wrote in a statement. The following trials are set to take place:The first trial, scheduled for February 2018, will cover six of the most “serious” alleged offenses filed against Cook, according to Ehlke. This includes one count of second-degree sexual assault and use of force, three counts of third-degree sexual assault, one count of strangulation and suffocation and one count of false imprisonment. It is scheduled to last three to four days.It is not yet clear where the trials would alternatively take place.After Cook was arrested in October 2016, many more women came forward to report the now-21-year-old. He was expelled from UW-Madison in March.","Alec Cook’s journal, filled with women’s names ‘systematically’ written in it, could be excluded from trials",UWM

Both stated that withholding records fosters confidence among employees that the Assembly has the ability to resolve internal issues.Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Minority Leader Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, both say they support the decision because they want to respect victim confidentiality. Vos argues that keeping the complaints private will encourage future victims to feel comfortable reporting any issues that might occur.“The goal of an internal process is to make sure that every single person who feels they were the victim of some kind of harassment has a way to go to be able to report it to somebody, have some confidentiality and have it investigated,"" Vos said.However, many people believe that releasing the records is a way to preserve accountability and give power back to the victims who do want their stories shared.Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council, and Jennifer Drobac, a University of Indiana sexual harassment law expert, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that it is wrong to keep the records in secret.Drobac claims if you do not publicize the identity of the perpetrator then they are more likely to commit an assault again.“The risk of leaving [the records] in secret grossly outweighs the risk to the individual women in most cases,” Drobac said.Vos argued in 2014 the GOP Assembly stripped former Majority Leader Rep. Bill Kramer of his leadership position after he was publicly accused of multiple counts of sexual harassment — including an incident where he groped a woman’s breasts in a parking lot.Even after Kramer was convicted and sentenced to five months in prison, the results of the investigation remain closed to the public because of the clerks’ hold on sexual assault cases.Under current Wisconsin law, victims have the right to redact their personal information from records; but Hintz claims this is not enough to protect the victims who are alleging sexual harassment or assault against legislative staff.“Even with the redaction, there is speculation about other things — some of the victims don't want those details out there,"" Hintz told the Associated Press. “I think our policy first has been to protect those most impacted by the release of that information.”Vos and Hintz held a mandatory training session on Tuesday to review the current sexual harassment policies with legislative staff in order to refresh them on the one-time training they received upon entry to their jobs.Other types of government agencies in Wisconsin, such as the Equal Rights Division and the City of Milwaukee, release all investigative information for discriminatory and harassment claims against their employees.

Title IX is a 1972 federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions receiving public dollars, including UW-Madison.After the 2015 survey, UW made sexual harassment and sexual assault prevention training mandatory for graduate students. Undergraduate students have also been required to complete a similar training program since 2013.The university has plans to initiate a training program for all “Title IX responsible” faculty to address the issue as well.Additionally, a 2016 report revealed that the number of reported sexual assaults on campus increased from 217 reports in 2015 to 325 in 2016.Tonya Schmidt, assistant dean and director in the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, said she attributes the increase in reports as part of the administration’s efforts to improve access to reporting and sexual assault education programs.According to the news release, a continuous campaign to educate and promote awareness of sexual harassment and sexual violence on campus will be developed to further improve prevention and reporting of sexual misconduct",UW-Madison to add a centralized reporting and database system for sexual harassment,UWM

No, the College Republicans chose to “report” on a tweet made by a former College Democrats of Wisconsin board member, Sarah Semrad, who resigned after taking responsibility and apologizing for said tweet. However, the College Republicans proceeded to inappropriately deride and personally attack Semrad, effectively using their position of influence to cyberbully a fellow student.This is a prime example illustrating where the CR’s priorities lie, as bullying someone is not reporting news whatsoever. It’s one thing to address her resignation, however the two news anchorwomen shamelessly laughed at her expense stating “Shoot, sounds like her boyfriend prospects might be dwindling” and “maybe her job prospects too.”Sarah Semrad is a dedicated and intelligent leader and these comments are degrading and completely uncalled for. Talking about someone’s job or boyfriend prospects is simply not news. This is a classic case of cyberbullying and if the comments weren’t enough, the fake laughter that followed shows how malicious it was intended to be.The video is childish and a horrible abuse of power. College Republicans are supposed to be representatives of a national political party and their juvenile actions make a mockery of it.It is disheartening to hear two presumably intelligent women, members of the CR Executive Board, degrade another woman in politics by labeling her undesirable to men because of her actions. Their attacks perpetuate the stereotype that a woman’s only goal is to find a boyfriend orplease men in life. Equating her “boyfriend prospects” to her worth is demeaning and a sorry attempt to push yet another woman down.Despite Democrats and Republicans disagreement on policy issues, it is of utmost importance to maintain a decent level of respect. The political divide is wider than ever and the College Republican’s pathetic attacks are a prime example of why it continues to grow. We are young professionals and must act like it, yet this video was the exact opposite of that. Their actions are completely inexcusable.The College Republicans inability to discuss more hard-hitting issues in their vlog speaks to the larger problem seen nationally when Republicans, especially the president, avoid commenting on troubling news stories or admitting faults in the party and simply to stick to their political agenda. There is a reason why the CR’s Newsflash highlighted Al Franken but neglected to mention pedophiliac Republican candidate Roy Moore.There is a reason they reported the Keystone pipeline leaked, but only gave their consolidations to “gas lovers” and fail to delve into the environmental repercussions the pipeline — which Republicans fought for — will have. The CR’s seemingly surrendered their integrity to stick to the party narrative. Their silence is deafening.The Newsflash video is far more problematic than it originally appears. The two anchorwomen fail to report concrete news by omitting relevant stories and facts that do not fit the picture they attempt to paint.Moreover, they blatantly bully a fellow student for a tweet and parade the video around like it’s news.

After race and ethnicity, the most common bias targets were national origin, at 13 percent, and gender, at 12 percent.Two of the 74 incidents last spring led to further disciplinary investigation by the university, and none led to a hate crime charge.UW-Madison defines “bias” as “single or multiple acts toward an individual, group, or their property that are so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that they create an unreasonably intimidating, hostile, or offensive work, learning, or program environment,” and specifies these are incidents “one could reasonably conclude” are based on race, gender, religion, disability, or a number of other factors.Graduate and professional students were much more likely to report incidents of bias than undergraduates. Although there are many more undergraduates on campus, they made up just 35 percent of bias reporters.44 percent of the students reporting bias were white, the report said, while 20 percent were international students from Asia. 48 percent of the incidents happened on campus, not including residence and dining halls, with 22 percent occurring online, 18 percent occurring in residence halls and 12 percent occurring off campus.Most of the reported incidents involved written or verbal harassment, but three physical assaults were reported as well.After race and ethnicity, national origin and gender, the most common targets were religion at 9 percent, gender identity at 8 percent, political affiliation at 7 percent and sexual orientation at 6 percent.The bias incident report comes just two weeks after the results of the first ever UW-Madison campus climate survey, which found underrepresented students have a significantly less positive view of the university environment than other students. UW-Madison uses an online bias reporting system which it has publicized more aggressively in recent years. Administrators said greater student knowledge of the system may have contributed to the uptick in reports.Additionally, it is “hard to say” whether UW-Madison’s bias numbers line up with those at other schools, a UW-Madison administrator said in a call with reporters Thursday, because these systems are all very new.Lawrence Andrea contributed to this report.

According to Raines, once the students “really get a sense of what these terms actually are,” they will be able to identify negative behaviors and learn how to intervene in dangerous situations rather than be a bystander.“[A goal of the course is] to harness [the students’] natural skills, experiences and relationships to really work on violence prevention,” Raines said.George Sorrells, a UW-Madison junior and vice president of the Acacia fraternity who took the course his freshman year, said it’s unique because it allows students to use their shared experiences of being fraternity members to inform their perspectives.Sorrells said the class used these experiences to discuss how they wanted to “change our community for the better.”“[The class] made me aware of some of the systemic problems facing our community and what can be done to solve them,” Sorrells said. “It’s easy to see now that it motivated a lot of the events and leadership positions I’ve found myself involved in [over the years].”Janie Felton, chair of the student organization Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment, said the course is an “integral part” of making campus a better place for students. She said the class is beneficial because it encourages student leaders to use their knowledge and skills to prevent sexual violence.The course will be held on Tuesday evenings in the Humanities building this coming spring semester.",UW course for fraternity members educates men on sexual violence,UWM

In order to ensure a fair trial and lower the risk of juror prejudice, they believe the trials should be moved outside the Madison area.“We believe that if we tried to pit a jury in Dane County, we could never get 44 prospective jurors who didn’t have at least 10 people who received alerts that there was a dangerous man on the loose on campus,” Van Wagner told reporters in September.Van Wagner said the problem is that with Madison’s reputation as a media hub of the state, many people paying attention to the news or using social media have seen Cook’s face and heard details of the reported assaults and harassment. He said it is unlikely they would be able to find people who haven’t already formed an opinion on the case.“We’ve got a really polarized campus community and we have concerns about that,” Nicholson added.The defense attorneys also filed a motion to suppress evidence that was allegedly obtained illegally, including notebooks and journals belonging to Cook.Investigators initially searched Cook’s apartment with his consent, according to court documents. They were looking for materials belonging to women and biological evidence when they came across a closed notebook in a drawer. They opened it and found a list of women’s names, which they photographed.Cook’s defense team says that since investigators took pictures of the notebook’s contents before obtaining a search warrant for it, the evidence should be suppressed, or not shown in the trials.

In Wisconsin, that loss could amount to over $50 million per year.""At 19 years old, there are very few things that you cannot do,"" state Rep. Adam Jarchow, R-Balsam Lake, told colleagues in a memo seeking their support. “They are adults eligible for military service, but cannot ‘enjoy an alcoholic beverage,’"" he said.Jarchow pushed for 19, as opposed to the popular European alternative of 18, to ensure that drinking would not become a distraction for high school students.The bill’s other co-sponsors include state Reps. Rob Swearingen, R-Rhinelander and former president of the Tavern League of Wisconsin, and. Rep. Cindi Duchow, R-Delafield.Jarchow also emphasized that no longer having to enforce federal alcohol standards would significantly cut law enforcement costs.""Those efforts could be used for other important issues such as drug abuse and sexual assaults,"" Jarchow added.The legislation includes a clause that would only it take effect if the state could avoid losing its federal funds, which makes the prospect of its implementation bleak.On top of that, the measure is opposed by Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, who heavily influences the chamber’s legislative agenda.Beyond procedural difficulty, some experts believe the measure would actively harm the 19-year-olds it would allow to drink legally.“I think the larger story is the link between alcohol, excessive drinking, and cancer, which appears to be pretty indisputable,” said Julia Sherman, coordinator of the Alcohol Policy Project.“We know that the younger a person begins to drink, the more likely they are to have alcohol-related problems in their future.”The bill is unlikely to attract much support under current conditions.",State legislators push to let 19 year-olds drink,UWM

Leah Vukmir, R-Brookfield, the legislation comes at a time when Wisconsin’s correctional institutions are already overcrowded and the sole juvenile detention center in the state is under investigations for negligence and reports of physical abuse.The first bill in the series could increase the sentence handed down to juvenile inmates by removing the three-year maximum sentence for attempting or committing serious crimes, including homicide and sexual assault.There is currently one facility in Wisconsin that handles the state’s delinquent youth — Lincoln Hills, a juvenile prison in Irma. Originally one of three similar institutions, it became the sole center after the Walker administration shutdown the other facilities in an effort to reduce state expenditures.Lincoln Hills is currently under investigation by the Department of Corrections for incidents of negligence concerning its failure to document and report cases of injury or assault within the prison, including misconduct involving the overuse of pepper spray and also improper restraining measures.The second bill eliminates the court’s ability to order future expungement, or deletion, of an offender’s record if they were sentenced before they turned 25. Instead, the offender could petition the court after a full year of completing their sentence.This would make the process easier for released offenders — particularly juveniles — as their ability to plea for expungement is not determined solely at the moment of their sentencing.The third bill would require the Department of Corrections to recommend revoking an offender’s parole, probation, or extended supervision if the subject is charged with a crime during that interval.The Department of Corrections estimates that this proposition alone would place nearly 1,800 more criminals behind bars.The fourth bill would require a five-year minimum sentence for repeat offenders for a range of crimes, from misdemeanors to serious offenses.The fifth and final proposal would mandate a minimum three-year sentence for offenders who illegally possess a firearm during their probationary, parole or supervisory period.Prison populations in Wisconsin have been on the rise since 2008, and are expected to reach a record high in 2019. Critics note that the bill series further promotes this issue without providing measures to prevent the recurrence of such offenses.  ",Harsher penalties for offenders under new crime legislation,UWM

Nearly one in three trans and nonbinary students and students with disabilities reported experiencing similar behaviors, according to the report.While news of the survey first became public amid intense campus pressure from movements like #TheRealUW in 2015, university officials countered that the initiative had been in the works long before these movements.The survey was scheduled after a committee report in spring 2014, according to Blank. The committee’s recommendations helped draft the Diversity Framework, which Chief Diversity Officer Patrick Sims said will guide the university’s efforts for a decade.Sims said that while the data only reaffirmed what students had reported in the past, the survey results will help UW-Madison improve programs already in place by helping to determine where to allocate funding.“[The data] helps you think about future allocation of resources, quite frankly,” Sims said. “How we direct resources, how we set ourselves up for success, to gauge where we want to go.”Blank referenced the 2015 AAUP survey that provided data on campus sexual assault to highlight the impact of this survey. When the sexual assault data came out, Blank said many people realized the problem was bigger than they had thought. This led to student-based efforts to put an end to it.The Campus Climate Survey Task Force, led by Sims and Dean of Students Lori Berquam, created future goals after sifting through survey data like ensuring an inclusive environment, increasing campus safety and promoting shared values of diversity and inclusion in the report.Blank said the results are not a call to start “a whole bunch of new programs,” but a call to the campus to realize there are people here who do not feel welcome.“Rather than starting 10 new things, we need to make sure that we are doing well the 10 things we have underway,” Blank said. “The data themselves will generate some conversation and personal reflection with some of the activities that are already underway.”Junior Maryam Muhammad, a student of color at UW-Madison who works on the Our Wisconsin initiative, said that while she supports the decision to focus on programs that are already in place, the university should make programs like Our Wisconsin mandatory so students know this is a serious issue.“You see information about initiatives like AlcoholEdu posted around campus, but you don’t see the same recognition for diversity and inclusion,” Muhammad said. “[These programs should be mandatory because] when made serious by the university, the students will feel more open to understanding these issues.”In addition to inclusivity issues, many underrepresented students feel “not at all” comfortable with contacting UW-Madison police if they have a problem.Less than half of the trans and nonbinary respondents said they would not be comfortable contacting UWPD, and less than one in three students of color reported they would not be comfortable reporting to officers.Muhammad said she was “unlikely” to contact UWPD again after a poor experience freshman year. Muhammad said that when she and her friends had racial slurs thrown at them in her residence hall, UWPD seemed as though they were trying to protect the offender, not the victims.“There was a lot of harm that happened, and I don’t think they were very considerate to the victims,” Muhammad said. “They could have taken more time to listen more to the victims and understand how we were feeling.”UWPD officials said the climate survey results represent a challenge that police departments across the country are currently facing. Sergeant Ryan Jesberger said that while 82 percent of total respondents said they felt “very” or “somewhat” comfortable contacting UWPD if they have a problem, the department “knows it can do better” to serve diverse communities.“We will continue to work with individuals and organizations on our campus to improve relationships and remove reporting barriers,” Jesberger said.Blank said UW-Madison’s climate survey is not unusual. Other colleges across the country — like Minnesota, U.C. Berkeley and the University of Illinois system — have produced similar surveys and found similar results.UW-Madison officials plan to repeat this climate survey every four to five years, according to Sims.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/10/bill-would-extend-protections-for-victims-of-domestic-abuse-across-country-lines,"October 25, 2017 | 7:56pm CDT","A bill that would aim to protect victims of domestic abuse by enforcing civil domestic violence protections issued by Canadian courts received a state Senate committee hearing Thursday.Senate Bill 369, otherwise known as the Uniform Recognition and Enforcement of Canadian Domestic Violence Protection Orders Act, has been adopted by four other states including California, Delaware, North Dakota and Nevada.Under current law, protection orders for victims of domestic violence in one state are upheld in other states. The bill would extend this understanding to include protection orders issued in Canada.State Rep. Ron Tusler, R-Harrison, sponsored the Assembly version of the bill along with another piece of legislation involving protections for victims of domestic abuse. Tusler testified on behalf of SB 369 during a public hearing.“I have represented victims of domestic violence and seen first-hand the effects domestic violence can have on the victims and their families,” Tusler said in his statement. “This bill, if passed, could save someone’s life at a critical moment.”Currently, Canada recognizes U.S. and Wisconsin domestic violence protection orders, however, there is no legislation under state law that explicitly allows for the law enforcement authorities or state courts to recognize and enforce Canadian court orders.If passed, this bill would establish explicit rules and treat Canadian court orders as if they were issued under Wisconsin law and allow full recognition of such domestic violence protection orders throughout Wisconsin.“Let us, as a growing number of our sister states have done, reciprocate in the spirit of comity, protect all victims of domestic violence and support adoption of this Act,” Tusler said.Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment, or PAVE, a student organization on campus dedicated to the prevention of sexual assault, domestic violence, and conduct of work based on violence prevention, expressed its strong support for Senate Bill 369.""PAVE supports Senate Bill 369, as it will offer greater protections to victims and survivors of intimate partner violence,” PAVE chair Janie Felton said. “We commend the efforts of Representative Tusler and Representative Stuck in introducing this bill during Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Survivors should be able to travel between Wisconsin and Canada without compromising their legal rights and protections in the process. Survivors have the right to feel safe and supported across borders.""Another measure related to domestic violence is slated to be formally announced in the coming weeks. The proposal would allow members of law enforcement who have been victims of domestic violence to file restraining orders reaching beyond their county of work or residency.A hearing on both bills is set to happen within the next few weeks.

She said this fear leads to underreported crime.“The unspoken toll of the massive number of undocumented people who feel they have no means of becoming documented is that families can become more hesitant about calling law enforcement,” Stillman said.According to Stillman, the fear that leads to underreported crime is perpetuating crime in the immigrant population. She said that the report rate of sexual assault among the Latin American population has decreased 25 percent since President Donald Trump came into office.Fear of reporting crime encourages criminals to “prey upon undocumented families” as they are less likely to face legal action, according to Stillman. She cited this as a consequence of an executive order that Trump signed into action, which holds local law enforcement officials accountable for enforcing immigration policy.“Trump enacted an executive order to essentially deputize local law enforcement to take the role of actual immigration enforcement,” Stillman said. “Right now they are separate entities, but this would make local officers essentially the equivalent of ICE agents.”Stillman said that although it may be difficult, she sees the most change when immigrants have the courage to tell their stories.“To me, the single most hope-inducing thing that I’ve seen is the ways in which these voices have stepped forward with stories and the leadership that’s been shown within these communities,” she said.","New Yorker writer speaks on immigration, criminal justice",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/10/despite-thousands-of-untested-rape-kits-regulations-bar-uw-from-lending-a-hand,"October 19, 2017 | 8:00am CDT","To decrease the number of untested sexual assault kits in Wisconsin, then-Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen formed a team in 2012 to address the issue. By May 2014, the state Department of Justice discovered over 6,000 sexual assault kits had gone untested state-wide.By May 2017 — after a year of inventorying 557 law enforcement agencies — agency officials confirmed that 6,391 sexual assault kits have been inventoried. Of those kits, approximately 4,000 are designated to be tested.The lack of sexual assault kit testing has been well-documented, and is not something unique to Wisconsin — in 2015, it was estimated that around 70,000 kits were untested nationwide.Although the DOJ hopes to have all 4,000 kits designated for testing to be sent to labs for processing by Fall 2018, UW-Madison’s genetic programs cannot join the effort.Sexual Assault Evidence Kits, also known as rape kits, are packages that contain evidence collected after a reported sexual assault.According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in the nation, the evidence compiled in a kit includes “a checklist, materials, and instructions, along with envelopes and containers to package any specimens collected during the exam.”The challengeTesting rape kits is a multi-step process that most healthcare providers and police departments can't do.For years, kits piled up in hospitals and police departments across the state. The backlog accumulated because these kits were never submitted to the state crime lab for testing.Once a licensed sexual assault nurse examiner administers the exam, it is then given to the police officials overseeing the case in the district where the assault occurred. Then police send the kit to a crime lab where it will be processed by trained professionals who test the available DNA samples.A tested DNA sample does not always match suspects law enforcement have on record, however. If the DNA does not show a match to anyone, police investigators then run the samples against a larger database. This database is called the Combined DNA Index System and is controlled by the FBI.All of this takes time and trained personnel, and may not yield a match. It also requires strict guidelines and enforced protocol.In many jurisdictions, the standards for when and how to send kits in for testing and analysis is unclear. At many police departments across the nation, sexual assault units are understaffed and under-prioritized, a study from Case Western University found.If sexual assault units are not prioritized or well-staffed, it is unlikely that police officials will make the decision to send kits in for analysis, according to victim advocates.Why do kits need to be tested?In many cases, kits provide crucial evidence that can help convict the perpetrator. Sexual assault kits are incredibly important, not only to the survivor of the sexual assault but also to the Department of Justice and the greater community, according to officials.Aside from identifying the guilty party, testing kits have additional, lesser-known positive outcomes.Properly analyzed kits allows the DOJ to link crimes together and identify serial rapists, according to End the Backlog Initiative. It also leads to improved accurate conviction rates by either eliminating innocent suspects or proving the guilt of a known suspect.The DOJ works hard to ensure that throughout this entire process, the perspective remains centered on what the survivors want and how they feel, according to Keeley Crowley from the DOJ’s crime victim services.“We want to make sure the survivors are heard in this process,” Crowley said.Can UW-Madison help?While it’s a good idea to see what the state’s largest research university can do to help, they probably can’t, said Ian Henderson, associate director of the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault.With UW-Madison’s close proximity to the DOJ, it makes sense to see if graduate students in the Genetics Department can donate time to help test some of the kits, according to Henderson. However, having graduate students test kits would conflict with national guidelines, he added.Kits need to be tested in an accredited laboratory which meets certain regulations. Nikki Roehm, director of the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory Bureau, said that if UW labs were used to test kits as a third party, they must follow specific rules and regulations and test staff proficiency every two years.“In order for us to use a third party lab for outsourcing DNA testing that third-party laboratory must also be . . . accredited by [the lab accreditation board]” Roehm said. “To my knowledge, the UW–Madison genetics lab is not accredited to the same standards as the [state crime lab].”But UW has done a great job with their advocacy programs on campus — whether those programs are student-led or university-affiliated, Crowley said. The importance of letting survivors of sexual assault know that there are resources available to them, Crowley said, cannot be overlooked.“Raising awareness on the issue of sexual assault and the resources available to survivors is so important,” Crowley said.Next stepsIn 2015, the DOJ, now led by AG Brad Schimel, received two $2 million grants to help reduce the number of un-submitted kits. Recently, the Wisconsin Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, a program created by AG SART, launched a website that tracks all un-submitted kits across the state of Wisconsin.This website displays data updating the public on efforts to reduce the number of un-submitted kits. It also provides in-depth descriptions of the kit testing process, frequently asked questions and court dates for alleged sexual assault offenders.The DOJ now tests kits at a rate of 200 per month, with the hopes of having all possible kits sent to crime labs by fall of 2018. They are outsourcing some of the work to an accredited, contracted forensics lab to expedite the process.Crowley, project coordinator for AG SART, said she’s aware of trauma un-submitted kits have caused survivors. Crowley is optimistic the backlog can provide a good opportunity for the agency to improve their institutional approach to sexual assault kits.If survivors don’t want their kit tested, they have the option to still have a kit collected without reporting it to law enforcement.The hospital will send the kit to the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory Bureau where it will be saved for 10 years, the statute of limitations for second and third-degree sexual assaults in the state of Wisconsin.“I think it's important to say while we respectfully acknowledge that SAKI offers us the opportunity for system improvement, we're sorry for any additional trauma or upset this accumulation may have caused survivors,” Crowley said.","Despite thousands of untested rape kits, regulations bar UW from lending a hand",UWM

Scott Walker thinks NFL players should stop their “divisive” protesting and focus on speaking out against domestic violence.Walker sent a letter Monday to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Players Association Executive Director DeMaurice Smith urging the league’s players to “stand for the American flag and the national anthem out of respect for those who risk their lives for our freedoms.”""It is time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem and move on from what has become a divisive political sideshow,"" Walker wrote in the letter.Walker said that instead of kneeling for the national anthem, NFL players should “speak out, as well as agree to take a personal stand, against domestic violence.”“Take a stand against domestic violence to keep American families safe,” Walker wrote. “That’s something we can all agree on, and that just might help the NFL reunite with many of its devoted fans.”Colin Kaepernick, a former quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, started the protest last season when he kneeled during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial inequities. Since then, and especially after President Donald Trump spoke out against the protesters, the movement has spread throughout the rest of the NFL.But Walker said after hearing domestic abuse victims’ stories, he was moved to steer NFL players down what he feels is the right path.“It occurred to me that NFL players could have a remarkable impact on [domestic violence] awareness and prevention efforts,” Walker wrote. “This is an issue that can unite people across America.”However, not everyone was impressed by Walker’s letter. Some agreed that the NFL must do more to prevent domestic violence, but felt Walker’s criticism of ongoing protests against racial inequality was unnecessary and an entirely unrelated issue.“Scott Walker might not be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, but the rest of us can and should be able to do both,” State Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, said in a statement. “Dialogues about racism and domestic violence are not mutually exclusive, and we shouldn’t have to choose between tackling misogyny or domestic violence and systemic racism.”Sargent also took issue with the governor’s silence about domestic violence issues in the NFL before the protests, dismissing the letter as a “political stunt for Walker to feel relevant.”“Well, after seven years in office, I’m glad Scott Walker finally woke up this morning and realized domestic violence in the NFL is a problem,” Sargent said. “It’s a shame Walker hasn’t ever spoken up when there’s been literal video evidence of brutal physical assaults, or when a player has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault.”October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a fact that Walker noted in the letter.","Scott Walker to NFL players: Stop protesting national anthem, address domestic violence problem",UWM

The policy mirrors a bill from the state’s Legislature that was drafted in response to interruptions of conservative speaker events on UW campuses last year.Young Americans for Freedom, the student organization that hosted Pavlich, has seen protesters at their events in the past. On Tuesday, Pavlich addressed students on responsible gun use and the importance of the second amendment as part of her “Trigger Warning” speaking spot.A small, 20-person demonstration by Cocks Not Glocks, a student organization that originated at the University of Texas to protest campus carry, occurred outside the event. The group promotes the idea that it is just as absurd to have a gun on campus as it is to publicly carry a sex toy.The protesters handed out dildos to passersby and chanted sayings like “this is what democracy looks like.” Kat Kerwin, the group’s leader, said Pavlich is a problematic speaker because her rhetoric is “based on the misbelief that women would not be sexually assaulted if they started carrying firearms.”“We are here to ensure people know that Katie Pavlich is speaking and to make sure people are thinking about gun violence prevention and thinking about what it means to be assaulted on this campus,” Kerwin said.Pavlich, in turn, addressed the protest in her speech, calling it sexual harassment for interfering with her work and creating a hostile workplace or educational environment.“We hear a whole lot about rape culture on college campuses. If you want to see what that looks like … [it’s] lots of men waving around dildos to protest me, a woman, on a college campus,” Pavlich said.“Did the protest take into account how victims of sexual assault might feel walking past the display of male genitalia?” Pavlich questioned.According to Kerwin, the dildo-centered protest was an attempt to attract attention to gun violence.“We aren’t here to disrupt the speech,” Kerwin said. “We need to be thinking about how we can move forward and continue to push our rights as protesters.”Pavlich’s speech centered on the need to have well-rounded arguments surrounding the use of guns for self-defense on liberal campuses, especially for women who want to defend themselves from attackers.She recalled walking home at night during her college days and the fear she felt because she was not allowed to bring her gun on campus.Pavlich also touched on the question of gun control in preventing mass shootings. There’s not a government solution to “every violent action that an individual decides to make,” she said.She also highlighted the economic benefit the gun industry has on the country, bringing in $52.1 billion in revenue, she said. Pavlich distinguished between two types of gun culture that she says are misconstructed by the media: Responsible gun owners and irresponsible gun owners.“There is an overwhelming respectful gun culture in America, and it should be celebrated,” Pavlich said. “The violent culture is the one that should be condemned and changed.”She suggested students who want to educate their peers with preconceived notions about gun rights should take them to a shooting range to show them what it’s like.“Nobody has the right to turn you into a victim or take your rights away because you’re uncomfortable,” Pavlich said.Overall, the event remained peaceful and allowed the expression of a wide range of viewpoints, according to a statement from UW-Madison.Kerwin said the regents’ free speech proposal “definitely changed the way” the group protested this event, but that it is still important to push the limits of campus protests. She said the group will “save disrupting protests” for speakers who they think are inciting violence.Sam Nesovanovic contributed to this report.",Pro-gun speaker event goes on without a hitch despite Cocks Not Glocks protest,UWM

The festival is being organized with Cocks Not Glocks UW-Madison in response to a visit by the pro-gun activist Katie Pavlich. As a student concerned about gun violence, especially when a campus carry bill is on the verge of passing (allowing someone to carry a firearm into classrooms, dormitories or Camp Randall), Pavlich’s invitation to spread misinformation has very real risks. For example, Pavlich encourages women to carry firearms to prevent sexual assault, despite overwhelming data confirming that women are more likely to have their guns taken and used against them. Encouraging our students and faculty to purchase guns at a time when weapons could already surge into our campus is both horrific and irresponsible. Of course, it is not just my own opinion, but also the democratic majority of the student body whose opinion truly matters. Our campus is united in its opposition to a campus carry bill, and thousands of students signed a petition to oppose the legislation in the 2016-2017 academic year. Such an incredible number of UW parents and alumni called Speaker Vos to raise concern that he was forced to abandon it in the last session. With such incredible opposition towards campus carry, why has Pavlich been invited to our campus? There are two.First, the bill to bring guns onto campus has been revived, hidden inside a more popular piece of pro-gun legislation that removes the permitting requirement for concealed carry of weapons. Several wealthy and powerful groups such as the NRA support this legislation, which makes it unusual that Pavlich’s invitation comes along with a $10,000 infusion of funds for the student organization that invited her. Her lecture, therefore, can only been seen as either a shameless play to manipulate students into supporting a bill that may get them killed or a transparent effort to make our campus appear divided.Our campus will not be divided, so we must react. What better way to celebrate our togetherness than with humor? Wisconsin state statute chapter 944 forbids ""drawing or writing lewd, obscene, or indecent materials in a public place.” Given the legislature’s recent interest in free speech, we thought we would take up two issues at once. The event will be a safe and welcoming space to protest by creating obscene art as well as the chance to be rewarded with a free sex toy from Cocks Not Glocks organizers.For those self-declared activists, students concerned about the potential of guns on campus or just women anywhere who resent the propaganda that women should learn to carry firearms rather than that men should learn not to rape, I earnestly ask you to join us, Cocks Not Glocks, on Tuesday, Oct. 10 at 6 p.m. outside the Psychology building to protest both the absurdity of Katie Pavlich’s divisive invitation while simultaneously exercising your freedom of expression and freedom to protest.What are your thoughts on campus carry?

But he is far from the only student to be the victim of a crime while traveling across the globe.According to the report, 45 crimes have been filed in the same six-year period. While only four of these reportedly occurred at JCU — two aggravated assaults, one robbery and Solomon’s death — questions arose regarding the safety and reporting practices of the university following the lawsuit’s filing.A UW-Madison student who wished to remain anonymous told The Daily Cardinal she was drugged at an Italian bar, Sloppy Sam’s, while studying at JCU. She suspected someone slipped roofies, a date rape drug, in her drink.This crime does not appear in the Crimes Abroad Report. Steven Barcus, director of communications for UW-Madison’s International Division, did not answer as to why this incident was not included in the data. But he said the International Academic Programs office abides by guidelines under the Clery Act — a federal law implemented at institutions of higher education that specifies which campus-related crimes must be reported. They work with the on-campus Clery Program Office to determine which incidents meet the act’s reporting guidelines.Sloppy Sam’s is one of three bars (the others being G Bar and Drunken Ship) in Rome frequented by traveling students. The student sipped on five drinks spread out over a five-hour span, but said she felt “completely sober” before she blacked out. Eventually, she, along with her roommate and several friends, decided to take shots at the bar. The student said she remembers the fifteen minutes following, and then nothing.The student’s only knowledge of following events was told to her by friends. Those friends told the student she was dropped off at their apartment by an unknown man, who authorities did not attempt to identify, and just barely managed to get into her apartment with help from an English-speaking, on-call resident assistant. She woke up with a swollen ankle and scratches on her shoulder, but no recollection of the previous evening.The day after the incident, the RA on call told her she had to file a formal statement for the incident and that the student was required to meet with Deanna Wylie Mayer, dean of students and director of housing and residential life at JCU. Mayer offered counseling help to the student and got her in touch with a doctor in case she wanted to be evaluated (she waited to get back to the U.S. to be screened for sexually transmitted infections — the results were negative).The student said Mayer told her she would contact UW-Madison and report the incident. UW-Madison did not receive a report about this student’s incident from JCU, according to spokesperson Meredith McGlone.“In the beginning of the program [JCU] told us that if anything happens they would report back to whatever your home school was,” the anonymous UW-Madison student said. “But I didn’t get contacted by UW or anything about it.”Mayer could not confirm whether she had filed the anonymous student’s report, as she said sharing information about a specific case without the victim’s consent would violate the student’s privacy rights.One Big Ten school severs ties with JCUFollowing Solomon’s death, the University of Iowa discontinued its study abroad affiliation agreement with JCU, though school officials did not cite the incident as reason for the discontinuation.

“We made this decision out of concern for the safety of students who go out at night in the Trastevere area,” UI spokesperson Tom Snee said in an email.According to UI’s statistics, two of their students have died abroad in the last 10 years.One of them was Andrew Mogni, who experienced a similar fate to Solomon’s in 2015 when he took “a severe fall” into the Tiber River during his first day at John Cabot. The accident left Mogni in a coma and he succumbed to his injuries three months later.The anonymous UW-Madison student’s incident also ended at the Tiber River, where they were found by the man who drove them to their apartment.The Solomon family’s lawsuit accuses JCU of “knowing the surrounding area was dangerous and neglecting to inform the students.” The surrounding area refers to the Tiber River, where Solomon’s body was found. JCU refutes the claims brought about by Solomon’s parents.“We provide comprehensive safety messaging to all of our students,” Mayer said in an email. “All students, not just Americans, are advised and provided with practical ways to exercise caution.”The Daily Cardinal asked why UW-Madison remains affiliated with JCU, and if there have been talks to disaffiliate like UI. McGlone said:Barcus and McGlone said UW-Madison gives students location-specific safety information in orientation before departure. McGlone added that students are directed to federal sites with safe traveler programs and all UW System study-abroad policies are consistent with the standards of the Forum on Education Abroad.Mayer detailed the numerous programs designed to educate international and degree-seeking JCU students about safety on campus and in the surrounding area. After arriving in Rome, students attend a health and well-being workshop that focuses on alcohol education, along with other orientation workshops. Students are also encouraged to take other security measures, like downloading a safety app onto their phones.The JCU dean said it is not uncommon to see Sloppy Sam’s and two other bars on the Tiber River cited in incident reports — JCU officials said they warn students during orientation against frequenting this area.McGlone said UW-Madison also partakes in ensuring and monitoring students’ safety while they are abroad. Barcus added the university monitors events abroad, as well as “actively assess[ing] risks” and trends reported by U.S. public agencies to maintain students’ well-being.“Though our immediate concern is to resolve the incident to best support the affected student, we also consider each incident as input to our site and program assessment,” Barcus said. “The data also helps inform what we share with students during pre-travel orientation and training.”The anonymous student attended JCU a little less than a year after Solomon was killed near the university. She said no one mentioned his death to new JCU students.However, Solomon’s death has not been forgotten. McGlone said discovery of further details surrounding the tragedy would allow for more safety measures for students, particularly in the JCU area.“Beau Solomon’s death was a tragic loss for his family and our campus community,” McGlone said in an email. “If additional information about this situation comes to light, we will proactively evaluate how it might impact our safety practices.”Maggie Chandler contributed to the reporting for this story.UPDATE Oct.2 at 1:34 p.m.: This article was updated to provide additional clarity of Clery Act's role in university records not accounting for the anonymous student's incident at JCU.","As others sever ties, questions follow UW link with controversial study abroad program",UWM

She is a journalist who has shared her perspective on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and Fox Business and currently serves as the news editor for Townhall.com. She has drawn criticism for her controversial far-right opinions, including from Cocks Not Glocks’ leader Katherine Kerwin.“It is so important to protest this speaker because she has been brought to campus with the intention to divide our campus and not offer ideas, but offer rhetoric that will inflame the student body,” Kerwin said. “Her rhetoric is particularly decisive because of her assertion that rape would be prevented [if] women owned guns.”But Young Americans for Freedom President Abby Streu refutes the claim that Pavlich’s ideas are dangerous.“We are bringing Ms. Pavlich to speak on the right we have, as stated by the Constitution, to bear arms,” Streu said. “The fact that any amount of sexual assault happens is absolutely awful.

The kit consists of samples of DNA and other pieces of evidence.Decades of backlog have led to 6,000 untested sexual assault kits in Wisconsin.Since these kits are sometimes collected years before a victim decides they want to report or take legal action against an offender, many kits accumulate or go untested.As part of their effort to end the backlog and test all kits, the DOJ will update the public and answer questions through their new website.The website will allow for the public to see the progress of what stage the kit testing is in, as well as court dates for sexual assault offenders. It also provides a detailed description about the program, going in depth on the testing process, the project’s partners, various resources and frequently asked questions.Testing the kits is the beginning of a long process for bringing justice to sexual assault victims, according to Schimel.“Now, in less than three years, DOJ and local law enforcement will process all previously unsubmitted kits and bring justice to sexual assault survivors after years of delay under previous administrations,” Schimel said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/09/crime-thriller-wind-river-intermingles-riveting-neo-noir-with-political-commentary,"September 28, 2017 | 7:00am CDT","Acclaimed screenwriter Taylor Sheridan has become synonymous with the art of tension in the dramatic thriller. His collaboration with Denis Villeneuve on 2015’s sleeper hit “Sicario” swiftly drew attention to his gritty, realist style that brings fans of the neo-noir flavor into contemporary, practical settings. The former “Sons of Anarchy” actor wrote and directed the recently-released crime thriller “Wind River,” in which Academy Award-nominee Jeremy Renner (“The Hurt Locker,” “Arrival”) portrays a skilled tracker who discovers the murdered body of a young woman on an American Indian reservation. Elizabeth Olsen (“Age of Ultron,” “Ingrid Goes West”) co-stars as the sole FBI agent who is sent out to investigate the supposed homicide. The narrative swiftly follows the pair as they delve deeper into the trail leading back to the perpetrators in a fiery blend of classical Hollywood tonality and Sheridan’s own inflections of intensity in a gut-wrenching story.An avid fan of the formal noir techniques myself, the first hint of professionalism to be found in “Wind River” is its consistency with Sheridan's previous features. Despite having not seen “Hell or High Water,” there is an overt parallelism to “Sicario”’s focus on the implications of characterial morality and motivation. Whereas Emily Blunt’s Agent Macy may refrain from questionable actions unless under extraordinary circumstances, Olsen’s performance assimilates into the reservation’s toughened lifestyle, acclimating to the harsh Wyoming climate. However, both Olsen and Blunt’s arcs mimic one another. While the scale of what’s at stake may vary between the two, both characters come to acknowledge the importance of “breaking the rules” in order to achieve their desired goals. In “Wind River,” this stems from arguably the most intense scene of the film: Olsen and Renner have traced the victim’s last whereabouts to an isolated oil drilling site. The armed operators there seem to flank the protagonists and police force in tow. Here, it’s uncertain what the operators’ motives are and what they are attempting to conceal. What ensues both questions the viewer’s expectations of the supposed macguffin and reveals the harsh reality of the film’s prime mystery through the lens of an uncomfortably graphic flashback. Unlike the 20th century approach to film noir, Sheridan’s protagonists do not evoke the vulnerable and dangerous femme fatale of paradigmatic conventions. Rather, they are given vulnerable and genuine traits that connect with the typical moviegoer. This might be visualized through Olsen’s trauma from when she disposed of a hostile threat, or her pronounced weakness after succumbing to injury. “Wind River” contains no Deus ex Machina, and instead forces its characters to properly earn their reward, which rests on a fine line between staying alive and solving the case.There is an additional obligation of praise to Sheridan for a masterful grasp on the technicalities of production. The unobtrusive lighting and set design are painfully delicate, as if they are literally shooting on a whim at locales they find intriguing, as opposed to a carefully crafted film set. This attention to silent detail is only matched by the discordant and emotionally provocative score, invoking tones of dread and despair in the context of the remote western landscape. The camera moves fluidly and tacitly, motivated by distinct pacing and motivation depending on the scene. The product that results at the combination of this triad is an effective bridge between the broad, sprawling styles of the classic American Western and the haunting actuality of crime that is present even in modern society; an authentically chilling rendition of present day violence is attained. Once again, this becomes the telltale style of Sheridan’s aptitude for not only forming organically unraveling tales of allure, but executing them in a visceral and almost documentary-esque style. However, the thematic core of the film still remains.It is revealed (SPOILER) that the murdered woman is a member of the reservation, and was in fact close friends with Renner’s daughter, who was previously killed in an unknown fashion. Large chunks of the film contain dialogue of grief and loss between the two pain-stricken families. The film ends on a lingering shot of Renner and the victim’s father (“Kimmy Schmidt”’s Gil Birmingham). A final wall of text burns into the screen, acknowledging the fact that Native American women are the only demographic for which there is no kept record in the Missing Persons Directory. Have no doubt, “Wind River” is a compelling crime drama through-and-through. However, Sheridan injects substantial themes of loss, familial strife and controversy through the depiction of the dismal Wind River Reservation. While a majority of the film focuses on the aspect of American wilderness, the reservation remains in a dismal state, wrought with drug addiction, sexual assault and poverty. These crises are indistinguishable from the true-to-life factors which leave reservations in a state that’s in much need of attention. While the film may appear hyperbolic about these representations, it serves as a call to attention on the very existence of these issues, and does so in a captivating, horrifying and empathetic manner which “Sicario” so apprehensively conveyed. A prime, tertiary installment to Sheridan’s crime drama trilogy, “Wind River” is a poetic and riveting contribution to film, bringing appraisal for both its contributions to the modern film noir and commentary on the neglected aspects of the political system.At the time of viewing the film, it was present in a mere 2,095 theaters nationally. This is a shockingly limited release that still surprises me, as this film is well worth the time and attention of the curious viewer.",Crime thriller 'Wind River' intermingles riveting neo-noir with political commentary,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/09/body-worn-cameras-could-become-a-part-of-madison-police-uniforms,"September 24, 2017 | 8:16pm CDT","The Madison community could be one step closer to seeing body-worn cameras on its police officers, despite privacy concerns that have raised contention among citizens and lawmakers in the past.If approved in next year’s capital budget — which lays out how the city will fund upcoming and existing projects — a $123,000 proposal would purchase nearly 50 body-worn cameras for Madison Police Department officers on the North Side of Madison.The project, sponsored by Ald. Paul Skidmore of District 9, would act as a pilot program for MPD. If it proved viable for officers on the North Side, citywide implementation would be the next step, although how much that would cost is still unclear.While body-worn cameras are widely used by law enforcement around the country, the idea has previously been a hard sell in Madison. A similar surveillance program was proposed in 2015, but was shot down by city council in a 19-1 vote.While many city lawmakers at the time said body-worn cameras could pose risks for illegal immigrants, Skidmore called that idea “irrational.”“The opposition was purely political,” Skidmore said. “We wouldn’t use footage for [immigration status concerns]. The camera is amoral — neither good nor bad — it just records what’s out there,” Skidmore said.MPD Lt. Kelly Donahue told The Daily Cardinal that public concerns about body cameras extend beyond targeting illegal immigrants.In previous discussions about implementing the cameras, she said, the community has voiced concerns over videos being made available through public records requests — though they would likely be subject to the same agency discretion rules that protect sensitive information.Police could also develop protocols around when the cameras shouldn’t be used, Skidmore said, like in sexual assault and domestic abuse cases.The capital budget will be finalized in late November.",Body-worn cameras could become a part of Madison police uniforms,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/09/after-over-a-semester-as-uwpd-chief-roman-revisits-her-goals,"September 14, 2017 | 12:02am CDT","When Kristen Roman was sworn in as the new UW-Madison police chief last spring, she stepped into the role with lofty ambitions. However, her first meeting with the Associated Students of Madison last February revealed some doubts students had about her intentions. With more than a semester now under her belt, Roman contends that she is sticking to her goals.Only a few weeks into her new position, Roman visited different shared governance groups on campus to facilitate open conversations, outline goals and stress that she wanted to maintain an open-door policy with the campus community.“I really want to focus on having those community conversations around the relationship that the community has with police and what role we play in supporting and furthering the mission of the UW and supporting students and faculty in the day-to-day work that we’re doing,” Roman said last year.During her rounds to different campus groups, Roman presented her goals to the Associated Students of Madison, which last year demanded that UWPD release a list of all their weapons after citing the need for greater transparency and accountability to the community.UW-Madison senior Tyriek Mack, then an ASM representative, disagreed with the way Roman responded to students who called for community control of the police. According to Mack, Roman had not listened to the students’ whole argument, and Mack questioned her commitment to responding to the campus.“I have a lot of hesitancy,” Mack said. “I feel as though the relationships that you had as a part of MPD with the community of Madison — I just don’t feel like it was genuine.”Roman assured representatives that her intentions were good.About eight months later, Roman says she is improving relations and transparency between UWPD and the campus community through the creation of “Chief's Corner,” a blog where she routinely posts updates on topics related to the police and campus.Roman now plans to establish a Community Advisory Council by the end of the semester. The committee would be comprised of leaders in the community, and would serve as a forum for “ongoing feedback and the exchange of information” used to hear from the community about their expectations for their police department and what concerns them in terms of campus safety and community safety, according to Roman.Roman said that once the Community Advisory Council is implemented, she would like to establish a similar offshoot committee comprised solely of students.“I’m hoping to put in place this exchange so that there’s communication with individuals and with groups that aren’t always heard and don’t always feel that we are listening,” Roman said.Regarding sexual assault, UWPD debuted a new awareness campaign this year entitled “We Believe You.” According to Roman, while prevention and education efforts are always a priority, the department is also trying to focus on the issue of underreporting sexual assault and taking victims seriously.“What we try to do with [the campaign] is be visible, to send a message that we care, that we start by believing, and we want victims to feel comfortable coming forward to report to us,” Roman said.According to ASM Chair Katrina Morrison, Roman’s efforts have not gone unnoticed. Morrison highlighted UWPD’s increased connections with the campus community as a major success.“UWPD has been making good strides to be better accessible to different communities and be more transparent,” Morrison said. Morrison specifically cited Roman’s collaboration with community leaders and availability to students in building and strengthening UWPD relationships in the campus community.While Morrison acknowledged Roman’s efforts, ASM’s chair still has goals for the chief.“My biggest goal for Chief Roman is that she continues to engage the community of color and that she tries to uncover what the police department can do better so that they don’t perpetuate stereotypes and ensure that students of color are safe on this campus and not just majority students,” Morrison said.","After over a semester as UWPD chief, Roman revisits her goals",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/09/little-time-behind-bars-for-uw-students-guilty-of-sexual-assault,"September 14, 2017 | 7:50am CDT","From 2011 to 2017, at least five UW-Madison students were convicted in sexual assault cases with maximum sentences that could have totaled more than six decades behind bars. But in total, the five students — three of whom were guilty of felonies — served less than a year in jail, which is significantly lower than typical sentencing norms for violent crimes.Nearly 90 percent of people convicted of rape are incarcerated, with 84 percent going to prison on an average sentence of longer than 10 years, according to a Bureau of Justice Statistics’ analysis of 2009 data on felony defendants from America’s 75 largest counties. The outcome of five recent cases involving UW-Madison students sharply deviates from these rates.The longest sentence among the felony cases involving UW-Madison students was four months, and another student convicted of a felony sexual assault was not sentenced to any jail or prison time.Wisconsin state statutes do not use the language of “rape,” meaning none of the five students faced that conviction. The cases involving UW-Madison students vary significantly by degree, but two involve guilty convictions to third- or second-degree sexual assault charges. These charges would fit the Department of Justice’s definition of rape — which is “the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.”Three other cases were for fourth-degree sexual assault charges, which would not fit this definition.But others have provided reasons for the short sentences, such as how less time spent incarcerated can mean a lower rate of re-offending and how a lot of the cases end with plea deals, which can bring reduced charges. Many students have been quick to condemn the punishments for sexual assault and sexual violence in general as too lenient, with some saying they could discourage victims from reporting assaults in the future. And as two nationally publicized sexual assault cases involving former UW-Madison students continue to move forward — Alec Shiva will be sentenced on Sept. 15 and Alec Cook will soon be heading to trial — some students are now advocating for harsher sentences to be handed down in future cases.“It’s outrageous. Clearly these perpetrators are not getting sentences that fit the crime,” said Katrina Morrison, chair of the Associated Students of Madison and an outspoken advocate for sexual assault survivors. “Sadly, I don’t expect Shiva to get a very appropriate sentence because that’s been the pattern.”The five students discussed in this story have gone through both criminal proceedings and university non-academic misconduct hearings and have been found guilty and responsible in both. They represent a tiny portion of all sexual assaults committed each year (2016 saw reports of 325 sexual assaults at UW-Madison).The Daily Cardinal obtained the names of the five students through an open records request made to the university. During this time period, it is possible other students went through just the criminal process and not the university non-academic misconduct hearing.Arrests bring potential of decades behind barsA Minnesota hockey game was on, and former UW-Madison student Douglas Gill was watching with several of his friends in Witte Residence Hall. He was also snorting cocaine and drinking alcohol, according to the criminal complaint.Gill later entered another student’s dorm room, where he forced the victim face-down on her futon and sexually assaulted her, according to the complaint. She said “stop” and “no,” and he responded by shushing her and saying “I want to make you feel good” and “I know you want it.”After he pleaded no contest in court, he ended up serving no more time behind bars for the assault. The outcome of Gill’s case is not unique; it largely mirrors the four other cases involving UW-Madison students.She was only able to get him off when she lied about being on her period. He then left the room and sent the woman a text. “I’m just gonna take a lot of drugs n (sic) pass out, sorry for literally raping you that was so not cool,” Gill wrote, according to the complaint.Gill was initially charged with two felonies (third-degree sexual assault and false imprisonment) and he faced a maximum sentence of 16 years in prison.Including Gill, four of the five students could have spent more than 10 years behind bars based on the initial charges they faced. Former UW-Madison student Andrew Beulen was initially facing 40 years after being charged in 2011 with second-degree sexual assault, though he later pleaded no contest to a third-degree sexual assault, which carried a maximum punishment of 10 years.The only case that did not include a felony charge at any point was that of Frank Jermusek, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of fourth-degree sexual assault and battery. He received a sentence of deferred prosecution, and both of these charges were later dismissed.Pleading down of chargesIn Gill’s case, a third-degree sexual assault charge was reduced to two misdemeanor counts of fourth-degree sexual assault. The same happened to Hwasung Yeom, whose initial charges included a felony of third-degree sexual assault. This charge was later dismissed, with Yeom then pleading guilty to the misdemeanor charges of fourth-degree sexual assault and disorderly conduct.This is not out of the ordinary for criminal cases, as nearly all guilty outcomes are from pleas rather than trials, according to the BJS data.UW-Madison Police Department Detective Lt. Brent Plisch said reducing charges in plea deals — which is left up to the district attorney’s office — is especially common in sexual assault cases because they are often “very difficult to prove.”“That’s the DA’s prerogative. They get to do that,” Plisch said. “It’s a bargaining chip that they hold as the district attorney to ensure that the cases move through the system while still holding the offender accountable.”Another reason plea deals are so prevalent in sexual assault cases is to prevent victims from having to testify in court, according to Plisch, who explained that it can be traumatic for victims to recount their assault in front of so many people.“From [UWPD’s] perspective, we would rather have the cases plead out in a manner that saves the victim from having to testify in court,” Plisch said. “But the victims are also consulted by the DA’s office about these plea bargains, they’re never just offered to the suspects.”The Dane County District Attorney’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The final sentencesOut of the five cases, only Nathan Friar went to trial. He was found guilty of second-degree sexual assault but not guilty of a count of strangulation and suffocation. Still facing 40 years behind bars, he instead got eight years of probation.“For Nathan Friar to walk away with eight years of probation when people go to prison for less severe crimes is absurd,” Friar’s victim later told BuzzFeed News. She went on to explain that the sentence could discourage other victims from reporting “because in a sense she is saying that the perpetrator’s life is more important than the victim’s.”After Gill’s charges were reduced, he still faced up to seven years and six months behind bars. He pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor sexual assault charges and the felony of false imprisonment.In the spring of 2015, Dane County Circuit Judge John Markson gave him a time-served jail sentence of four days and three years of probation. Markson said he did not send Gill to jail because the defendant took the situation very seriously and showed “sincere regret,” according to the Wisconsin State Journal.Patti Coffey, a UW-Madison professor who has specialized in sex offender risk assessment, said that longer jail or prison sentences are not always the key to reducing the chances an assailant reoffends. Often, the longer a person is behind bars, the harder it is for them to readjust when they’re released, she said.“There is some research that suggests a slight increase in risk if you’re incarcerated for a longer period of time than someone who is sentenced to the community or sentenced to a lesser period of incarceration,” Coffey said. “There’s a lot of reasons to be concerned about incarceration if our concern is future risk. Sometimes it’s not our concern; sometimes it’s a punishment.”Through UW-Madison’s separate non-academic misconduct hearing, Gill was expelled from the university — one of six students to receive that sanction in the past decade.Morrison said she’s hesitant to advocate for mandatory minimum sentences for sexual assailants because of the harm those punishments have brought to people of color. But still, she said there needs to be more serious sentences levelled against those found guilty of assault.“I do think there should be more of a commitment to prosecuting these people,” said Morrison, who hopes to one day be a public defender in her hometown of Milwaukee. “I feel like there needs to be a systematic and a cultural shift that we start viewing sexual assault as something that is incredibly serious and that needs to be punished seriously.”",Little time behind bars for UW students guilty of sexual assault,UWM

The following trials are set to take place:The first trial will cover six of the most “serious” alleged offenses filed against Cook, according to Ehlke, including one count of second-degree sexual assault and use of force, three counts of third-degree sexual assault, one count of strangulation and suffocation and one count of false imprisonment. It is scheduled to last three to four days, beginning Feb. 26.The second trial, involving two felony stalking charges filed by two women, is scheduled for April 9 and expected to last about two days.Lawyers for Cook, who has been accused of 21 counts including second-degree sexual assault, felony stalking and strangulation, requested in June the case be split into 11 trials. The charges filed most recently had already been ruled to be tried separately from the earlier ones.Now that the first couple trial dates have been set, defense attorneys Chris Van Wagner and Jessa Nicholson are seeking to move them out of Dane County. Noting the high-profile nature of the cases, heavy press coverage of them in the Madison area and the involvement of the UW-Madison community, they argue that a Dane County trial would be at risk of jury bias.“The reach of the university, the tentacles of the university campus, go far and let’s face it: Madison is a media center for this part of the state,” Van Wagner told reporters Friday. “There’s just no way it’s likely we’re going to get 40, 50, 70, 100 people from whom we can call 12 to 14 people who can say, ‘I haven’t heard enough about this case to have an opinion.”“We have a really polarized campus community and it’s concerning,” Nicholson added.The defense is expected to file a motion for a change of venue in coming months, although it is not yet clear whether Ehlke will grant it or where the trial would alternatively take place.After Cook was arrested in October 2016, many more women came forward to report the now 21-year-old.

The way sexual assault cases are handled at UW-Madison is not expected to change, according to Chancellor Rebecca Blank.“We have worked hard to develop a set of policies and practices that serve our students well and we do not plan to change them,” Blank said in a statement.Blank went on to say she believes UW-Madison is fair, impartial and ensures victims and the accused have a fair process.DeVos, however, disagreed that the guidelines nationwide were fair.“The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims,” DeVos announced.She added that internal university investigations of sexual assault, where students and faculty act as “lawyers and judges,” lets both victims and the accused down. This is especially true when victims are re-traumatized by an accused student appealing the case, or when a student has to “sue their way to due process,” DeVos said.“Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach,” DeVos added.Her department is currently hearing from those involved in both sides of an investigation to replace Title IX with a “workable, effective and fair system.”Critics say changing current policy would weaken victims’ rights and perhaps deter them from reporting an assault.“It sends a frightening message to all students: Your government does not have your back if your rights are violated,” victim advocate group National Women’s Law Center said in a statement.

Results from the survey showed that while just 4.1 percent of female undergraduates reported sexual harassment by university faculty, 32.9 percent of female graduate or professional students reported harassment by UW-Madison faculty, staff or administration.The online training program—which will be hosted on D2L in Learn@UW—was designed, developed and implemented in response to federal, state and UW System expectations, but was also influenced by the recommendations made by the Sexual Assault Climate Survey Task Force, according to UW-Madison genetics professor and task force member Bret Payseur.Payseur said that after the task force survey found “a remarkable rate of sexual harassment of graduate and professional students by faculty members,” the force came up with recommendations about how to deal with this issue. One solution was to increase awareness and training for employees on campus.“Faculty are charged with educating students, but they are also charged with keeping them safe and supporting their well-being” Payseur said. “I think it is fundamental that we are aware, as faculty, of the scope and nature of this problem and that we are part of the solution. This means knowing how to effectively respond when a student approaches a professor and reports an experience they’ve had. It also means faculty learning about their own behavior.”Payseur acknowledged that sexual violence and harassment has become a growing problem at UW-Madison but said that this prevention program is a part of the solution.“The way we start to change [the growth of sexual violence] is to make faculty aware of what is acceptable behavior and to hold each other accountable,” Payseur said. “This program, which is really about education and raising awareness, is a very positive step in that direction.”UW-Madison employees will be required to take a refresher course every three years.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/07/campus-sexual-assault-survivors-deprived-of-justice,"July 28, 2017 | 8:30am CDT","Two sexual assaults reported at UW-Madison ended in injustice this month. Nathan Friar will serve eight years of probation for a second-degree sexual assault he was convicted of, and no jail time. Nicholas Ralston was found not guilty of third-degree sexual assault, despite sending a text stating, “...I sexually assaulted [the victim] last night…”It’s common for editorials or campaigns speaking out against sexual assault to open with statistics. The numbers often include, but are not limited to: every 98 seconds an American is sexually assaulted. Or only an estimated six out of every 1,000 perpetrators will end up in prison. Perhaps they include that 63 percent of sexual assaults are not reported to police or that the prevalence of false reporting is between 2 percent and 10 percent, that 91 percent of the survivors of rape and sexual assault are women, that more than one in four female undergraduates at UW-Madison were sexually assaulted during their time here.The hope, in the use of these statistics, is that we will be forced to confront a reality—an epidemic so widespread, a culture so sickening—and be moved by it. The hope is that the numbers will evoke logic and the logic will evoke empathy, until we eradicate the elements of our society that allow this devastating pattern to continue. However, there’s a time when we have to ask ourselves, is the cold reality of these statistics having an impact in a culture void of logic?The legal system as a whole repeatedly fails, favoring patriarchy over rational thought—these cases are no different. These two cases and the justice system at large in regard to sexual assault were not built on a basis of logic and empathy; they were built of a foundation of disproving the legitimacy of survivors. They were built on our collective cultural inability to trust survivors, to trust women.In the course of a month, both cases—among an ongoing history of similar cases—provided gut-wrenching answers to fundamental questions. In the case of Nathan Friar: How seriously do we take the crime of rape? How seriously do we punish it? In the case of Nicholas Ralston: Do we believe perpetrators? Or do we believe survivors?Friar’s defense—the one that presumably allowed him, a rapist, to walk free of jail time—was one built almost entirely on victim-blaming, even in the aftermath of her assault. Even after the survivor attested to the immense degree of anxiety she experienced following the trauma, Friar’s attorney Brian Brophy countered that her “very active” presence on social media proved the survivor appeared to be doing “great.” Based on the lack of severity in Friar’s punishment, the ruling sympathized with a rapist’s lawyer’s interpretation of the survivor’s social media account more than sympathizing with the survivor herself. Despite all logic, they did not believe the survivor.Although they did find Friar guilty of sexual assault, the jury cleared his strangulation charges under the argument that the marks on her neck could potentially be hickies instead of bruises. This was after the survivor’s report that Friar had strangled her. Again, despite all logic, they did not believe the survivor.Ralston’s defense—the one that let him walk away without consequence—was founded solely on a premise of not trusting the survivor. Even after a clear confession via text message, the jury chose to believe Ralston’s claim that his own confession was wrong, stating the survivor falsely convinced him that he had assaulted her. Despite all logic and a clear confession, they did not believe the survivor.When Ralston’s attorney Adam Welch claimed his client’s confession was a product of the survivor’s manipulation, he argued: “Nick trusted [the survivor] and believed her ... That’s not a confession. It’s good character.”There’s a glaring double standard and a stomach-turning irony in Welch’s statement. If trusting and believing a survivor was an emblem of good character, it most certainly did not appear among the jury by the same standards the jury applied it to Ralston.How many more women will it take? How many bodies violated? How many more survivors traumatized? How many more people waking up at night in a cold sweat for the rest of their lives? What will it take until we finally believe survivors? It’s “good character” to believe survivors, after all.To survivors: We believe you. The justice system and the society that upholds it may not support you, but there are people who do. Do whatever it takes to care for yourself. Your self-preservation alone is radical in a system that fails to preserve you.To advocates facing a void of logic and empathy at every turn: Do not let your voice shake as you continue to scream directly into said void. Remember the statistics, even when it feels pointless. Steer clear of apathy and keep speaking out against a system that fails time and time again, even when it feels like an impossible battle on all accounts.We hope that logic and empathy will win over all; most of us believe it will. What the outcomes of these crimes that happened on our campus prove—what the outcomes of too many sexual assault cases prove—is that, in the case of sexual assault, empathy and logic do not matter. When it comes to believing the survivor, empathy and logic do not matter. So we’ll keep fighting until the day that they do.Cardinal View editorials represent The Daily Cardinal's organizational opinion. Each editorial is crafted independent of news coverage.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/07/cook-defense-moves-for-11-separate-trials,"July 27, 2017 | 8:31pm CDT","Defense attorneys are seeking 11 separate trials for all charges brought against expelled UW-Madison student Alec Cook.Chris Van Wagner and Jessa Nicholson Goetz filed a motion June 30 arguing that grouping the 11 sets of allegations into one trial—each brought by women claiming they were assaulted by Cook between September 2014 and October 2016—could create “astounding” juror prejudice against their client, the Cap Times reported.“If jurors hear multiple accuser's accusations in one trial, they will be unable to sort out if there is enough evidence to convict on any one crime,” Van Wagner told The Daily Cardinal. He added that hearing multiple claims together could change their way of thinking.“No doubt in our mind that if all of these cases are tried to the same jury at the same time there's no way [our client] is going to get a fair shake on any individual case,” Van Wagner said.According to Wisconsin law, in order for charges to be tried together they must have similar character or be based on the same act, or series of acts, that constitute part of a common scheme.The defense states that even though all allegations reportedly took place on or near the UW-Madison campus with students, the similarities are not enough.The court filing noted that all accusers had different relationships with Cook prior to the alleged assaults, and evidence of interaction does not overlap between the cases. The filing argued that the common theme of Cook looking for a girlfriend in his interactions with the accusers is not enough to be considered part of a “scheme or plan” under the law.“The notion that each woman did or didn't consent isn't a pattern. Each sexual encounter between two adults is different,” Van Wagner said.Cook faces two separate cases since an 11th accuser came forward in June after the first case with 10 women was already under way. The Cap Times noted that prosecutors—the state Attorney General’s office and the Dane County District Attorney’s Office—had told the court they intended to ask to combine the cases.According to the June 30 motion, defense attorneys anticipated that the prosecutors would attack their client's character as they did at a bail hearing by painting him as a “serial rapist and sexual predator.”Prosecutors have until Aug. 1 to files responses to defense motions.Update Aug. 1, 1:20 p.m.: This article was updated for clarity.

She woke up at approximately 3 a.m. to Ralston—whom she, at the time, thought was her boyfriend—putting his penis in her mouth. Ralston also placed the victim’s hand on his penis during the assault, which she testified lasted between five and 10 minutes.Ralston told police the next day, according to the complaint, that he did not remember assaulting the victim, but if she said he did then it “must be true.” In a group message to friends that same day, he wrote, “Just so all of you know, I sexually assaulted [the victim] last night and will be living in Tripp for the rest of the year.”But the defense said Ralston only made those admissions to the assault because the victim convinced him it happened.“Nick trusted [the victim] and believed her,” said attorney Adam Welch. “That’s not a confession. It’s good character.”Hammering away at a lack of physical evidence found on the defendant’s penis following the assault, Welch argued the victim could have mistaken her boyfriend for Ralston in the dimly-lit dorm room, adding that she was drunk and couldn’t “coherently piece together” the night.In cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Tracy McMiller—noting a window in the dorm room allowed enough light in to identify a person—said it was clear Ralston ""took advantage of and sexually assaulted [the victim] at her most vulnerable.”Peter Coutu contributed to this report.",Former UW-Madison student found not guilty of third-degree sexual assault,UWM

She ordered the 22-year-old no contact with the victim or her family and said he would remain a registered sex offender.A woman, then 21, reported in June 2016 that Friar sexually assaulted and strangled her in his West Gorham Street apartment. She testified that Friar was “aggressive” and inflicted pain during their sexual encounter, digitally penetrating her, forcing himself on her and repeatedly choking her.Friar, who testified the woman initiated consensual sex, was later found guilty of second-degree sexual assault and use of force. The jury, however, did not find him guilty of strangulation—saying marks left on the woman’s neck after the incident could be hickies instead of bruises—and that charge was cleared.Noting that acquittal, Reynolds said the court can’t be certain about the exact level of force the jury relied on when reaching their verdict. She ruled it “highly unlikely” that Friar will reoffend and said he does not pose any risk to society.The sentencing followed emotional statements from individuals on behalf of both the defense and prosecution.“The vulnerability and anxiety that have accompanied my assault are undeniable,” the woman said, adding she could not eat normally or comfortably leave her apartment for months following the incident.But Friar’s lawyer, Brian Brophy, in an unusual argument, said the woman’s “very active” social media presence suggests otherwise. He concluded after checking her accounts—which featured photographs of various trips and outings during the last year—that it appears she’s doing “great.”Several family members and friends of Friar made the case that he’s been “punished enough,"" after being suspended from UW-Madison and losing scholarships.Reynolds also noted the woman’s and defendant’s use of alcohol as a factor leading up to the incident.“In this case, we have two 21-year-old college students with a significant amount of alcohol and spotty memories,” Reynolds said. “Indeed, the college campus culture of alcohol, hormones and impulsive behavior is not a good combination. In this instance and numerous other circumstances, it has resulted in poor choices and in [the woman] being traumatized and Nathan Friar being a convicted felon and a registered sex offender.” ",Former UW-Madison student convicted of 2nd-degree sexual assault won’t serve jail time,UWM

UHS Violence Prevention Specialist Alex Nelson, who helped create much of the content that students will see in the new program, said that the main reason for the change of programs was to stay up-to-date with campus culture.“As with any online program, especially a video-based program like Tonight, it is bound to get outdated very quickly,” Nelson said in an email. “Not only that, but the landscape of violence prevention has changed a bit as well. As an office dedicated to being on the cutting edge of technology and violence prevention best practices, we anticipated that the program could only stay ‘contemporary’ for about 3-5 years when it was first created.”Much like Tonight, U Got This! will include both an online and an in-person component. The virtual program—educating students on violence prevention and UW-Madison policies surrounding it—will include four modules totaling 60 minutes. After completing the online program, students will be required to attend an in-person GetWIse workshop, which are 90 minutes long and expand on a variety of topics such as healthy sexuality, healthy relationships, how to support a survivor and bystander intervention.Although U Got This! features a similar structure to the Tonight program, Nelson said the new program is more engaging due to its humor that responds to the emotions and actions of students.“Students who have seen Tonight will likely notice several major differences, mainly in that the U Got This! program has a sense of humor,” Nelson said. “UGT is truly a dialogue. It remembers and responds to the students’ reactions while taking the program. For example, if a student gives a snarky response to a question, the program will respond back in a snarky manner.”In addition to being engaging, UGT is providing opportunities for marginalized students to talk about their problems. The GetWIse workshop, along with offering students the opportunity to learn about topics such as healthy relationships and supporting survivors, offers closed sessions for LGBTQ and black students, according to Nelson.First-year and transfer students are expected to complete the online part of U Got This! by Sept. 22 and the in-person WIse workshop by Dec. 15.UPDATED July, 9 2017 3:57 p.m:.

Between 2011 and 2015, there were 18 suspensions for sexual assault and only 3 expulsions.However, that gap disappeared in 2016.There have also been three suspensions for 2016 sexual assaults so far, matching that year’s expulsion total.(Story continues below) Above are the outcomes for all of the sexual assault hearings held by the university since 2009. Three 2016 cases still have unknown outcomes and could be ongoing. Graph by Peter Coutu.When deciding the punishment for each case, UW-Madison’s code of conduct is tied to the four degrees of sexual assault found in state statutes, according to Tonya Schmidt, director of UW-Madison’s Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. Third-, second- and first-degree sexual assault, which involve some form of penetrative assault, result in either suspensions or expulsions.The more violent, the more likely a student is to get expelled, according to Schmidt.“We don't have a cookie-cutter approach to it because each sexual assault case that's penetrative could have some different nuances to it,” Schmidt said. “If there is something more violent—obviously a sexual assault is violent, to begin with—but if there's false imprisonment or strangulation or those threats we talk about, that could increase it up to something like an expulsion. So we look at every one of them as a case-by-case basis.”Chair of UW-Madison’s student government Katrina Morrison said she is “pleased that UW-Madison is beginning to take sexual assault allegations more seriously,” but that she still wants to see “the administration do more to hold perpetrators accountable and stop the sexual assault epidemic on our campus.”She said she’d still like to see administration prosecute assailants more frequently, raise more awareness regarding assault and provide survivors with more readily accessible resources.Among those expelled recently are Alec Cook and Alec Shiva, two former UW-Madison students whose arrests made waves throughout campus.Cook currently faces nearly two dozen criminal counts, including second-degree sexual assault, strangulation and stalking after 11 women have come forward to report him. Shiva is also facing felony counts of strangulation and second-degree sexual assault, as well as false imprisonment.Both students have drawn significant media coverage, which Schmidt said was not a factor in how her office handled the hearings.Students can also be placed on probation after being found responsible for sexual assault, which is the usual sanction after a fourth-degree sexual assault—defined as “unwanted or nonconsensual touching of privates areas”—is committed, according to Schmidt.

“For anyone found responsible for those types of situations, our typical sanction is a two-year probationary period” and some mandated educational programming, Schmidt said.

In addition to the three expulsions and suspensions handed down, there were two probations and four not responsible verdicts following UW-Madison investigations of 2016 sexual assaults, according to university officials.

The outcomes of three cases stemming from 2016 investigations are still unknown to The Daily Cardinal, and some may still be ongoing. UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone said the university is not in a position to regularly update the outcomes of sexual assault hearings, as they typically only compile the results in annual reports.

Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, introduced a bill Thursday to curb non-consensual condom removal, better known as “stealthing.” Sargent described stealthing in a press release as “the practice of secretly removing a condom or sexually protective device without the sexual partner’s knowledge or permission.”An article published in the Columbia Journal of Gender and Law last month first drew attention to the practice. Alexandra Brodsky, a Yale Law School graduate who wrote the paper, called stealthing “a grave violation of dignity and autonomy.”“Nonconsensual condom removal during sexual intercourse exposes victims to physical risks of pregnancy and disease,” Brodsky wrote. “Ultimately, a new tort for ‘stealthing’ is necessary both to provide victims with a more viable cause of action and to reflect better the harms wrought by nonconsensual condom removal.”Brodsky says in the article that the lack of national and state laws specifically addressing stealthing is concerning. Sargent is hoping to address the problem on the state level with her bill, which she is circulating for co-sponsors.The legislation, according to a press release from her office, “modifies the definition of consent to engage in sexual intercourse or sexual contact on the conditional use of sexually protective devices.”“Sexual predators will continue to find new, egregious ways to violate and victimize others, and it’s important that as legislators we take concerted steps to be responsive as we become aware of it,” Sargent said in the release. “This behavior is predatory and disturbing, and people should know we not only find it reprehensible, but that we won’t tolerate it.”The practice has been highlighted in many national and local news sources, including ABC, CNN and the Wisconsin State Journal.A 2015 Association of American Universities survey showed that 27.6 percent of UW-Madison undergraduate women reported experiencing non-consensual penetration or sexual touching.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/05/many-warnings-of-sexual-assault-on-campus-but-few-arrests-ever-follow,"May 1, 2017 | 9:00am CDT","With a vibrating buzz or a quiet ding, a student at Camp Randall Stadium for this year’s commencement would have checked their phone two dozen times to find warnings of nearby sexual assaults during their last four years at UW-Madison.These alerts rarely have follow-ups.Few of these warnings of sexual assault resulted in police investigations, and even fewer—one out of the 24 total—resulted in an arrest. That arrest ended in deferred prosecution.UW-Madison Police Department officials weren’t surprised by this information—which was obtained through an open records request by The Daily Cardinal—and explained why so few warnings ultimately yielded arrests.“It's very possible that many of these, and quite often most of the crime warnings we send out, do not initiate a police investigation at all,” UWPD spokesperson Marc Lovicott said. “If we don’t have a victim, or they don’t want to share the identity of the offender, then we won’t be able to make an arrest.”Lovicott and UWPD Director of Clery Compliance Jaimee Gilford said this is often due to the decisions of survivors, as well as the difficulty of finding the suspect.Lovicott said UWPD is often notified of sexual assaults through third-party reports, typically coming from a Campus Security Authority or housing reports. In other instances, a survivor may open an investigation but decide to no longer proceed with the process later on.During the years 2013 to 2017, there were 38 total crime warnings, with 24 of those being for varying degrees of sexual assault. UWPD investigated 13 of these sexual assault cases—the rest were reported to different resources.In the situation when a third party is notified of an assault, Gilford is made aware of it and it is determined whether a crime warning should be issued. But, UWPD does not open an investigation unless the survivor comes forward to the department.“We need to make sure, especially with these sensitive crime cases, that … the victim is steering the boat,” Lovicott said. “If they do not want to speak with police we absolutely respect that. If that’s the case we literally can’t investigate something when we don’t have a victim who's willing to share information with us.”The goal of the crime warnings is to warn the community of an ongoing threat, according to Gilford, but must protect the identity of the survivor while doing so.Crime warnings are issued under the Clery Act, a federal law that requires all institutions of higher education to have in place particular safety and security policies and report certain crimes to the community, according to Gilford. The warnings are sent when one of the Clery crimes occurs in a timely manner in a Clery geography area, which is defined by on-campus property, public property and non-campus property.Gilford is notified of the crimes and consults the UWPD manager-on-call who determines if the crime poses a continuing threat to the community. Gilford said most cases are considered ongoing if the suspect has not been taken into custody. If they decide this is the case, a crime warning is sent to anyone with a UW-Madison email address.Crime warnings are required to include information explaining what triggered the offense, as well as information about what people can do to protect themselves and prevent a recurrence of the crime. A description of the suspect and photographs if available are also included.There are several details, though, that legally do not have to be disclosed. The specific address of the incident, for instance, is not explicitly listed. For example, 13 of the 24 total crime warnings occurred in residence halls, but citing the specific hall in a crime warning would be considered the survivor’s address. Instead, a description such as “a southeast residence hall” is used.Lovicott said details that would jeopardize the police investigation, such as specific time stamps, are also not included.Sam Johnson, a violence prevention specialist with University Health Service’s End Violence on Campus unit, said she often hears from students that the crime warning emails are vague and they wish they knew more, especially about the situation of the survivor.“[It’s] part of the protection of the law that there’s a duty to disclose crimes, but there’s also a safety and privacy concern for the victim that experienced that crime,” Johnson said. “[This] is why you don’t get a lot of follow-up information with the campus community. UWPD determines there is an ongoing threat to the rest of campus, and they really have to balance individual safety and community safety.”She said UWPD has to be careful when describing even the most minor details because “information travels quickly” and events can be pieced together with the slightest clues, especially in close communities such as residence halls and Greek houses. She said not disclosing particular information protects the survivor’s privacy.If a survivor of a sexual assault chooses to go another route and does not file a report with UWPD, they are provided with the assistance they want, according to Gilford. If the incident is reported to UW Housing, the survivor is given resources—such as a support person—and is put in touch with the residence hall office. The Title IX coordinator as well as a Title IX consultation team review the case and reach out to the survivor to ensure they receive the support they need.Johnson said there are a number of reasons why survivors do not often move forward with police investigations. Among these are not knowing how to file a report, fear of authority figures and police more generally and the stigma that survivors will not be believed.She said although the number of arrests compared to that of crime warnings may appear disproportionate, arrests often do not occur out of the personal interest of the survivor and their reluctance to pursue an investigation, sometimes due to protection of their privacy.“From a victim advocacy perspective we encourage the student to focus on what's going to be best for them and their own healing process,” Johnson said. “They are the expert in their experience, so they get to prioritize their own safety and interests first.”","Many warnings of sexual assault on campus, but few arrests ever follow",UWM

University officials said they “have heard clearly from the Jewish community how targeted they feel by the actions of the last month.”The response from members of ASM—which was also signed by five other campus groups—said “the Chancellor refuses to acknowledge our genuine concerns regarding [university’s] involvement in the oppression of our communities.”The ASM response said the “quick, passionate” statement from administration “ultimately serves to maintain white supremacy” as the university hasn’t made similar statements during “the numerous acts of discrimination against black communities.”They said the university had “lackluster” responses to many recent events, such as when a student being arrested during class; when attendees at a Badger football game put a noose around a costume of President Barack Obama; and when Native American students were mocked during a healing circle for sexual assault survivors.The university again emphasized in the statement that Blank is in “opposition to the concept of [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions] and academic boycotts,” though co-sponsors and proponents of the legislation have previously separated it from BDS, which has been sharply criticized.ASM’s response to the statement said the “legislation is not an academic boycott; it does not target Jewish students nor the State of Israel, but corporations complicit in human rights abuses. This is not BDS.”In their response to the university, ASM also demanded an apology from UW communications and reiterated their previous demand, stating that the “UW Foundation to immediately divest from the corporations identified in the legislation.”Blank also said she plans to meet with next year’s leadership of ASM to emphasize “the need to act with integrity and in ways that promote involvement by all students.”","‘Concerned members’ of ASM, campus groups demand Chancellor Blank step down",UWM

AAU released a new report Wednesday that showed UW-Madison has made progress in combatting sexual assault.The new report is a follow-up on a 2015 survey of college students that found high rates of sexual assault on campuses and low rates of reported incidents, due to factors including shame and worries that the case would not be taken seriously.Universities participating in the AAU study have since increased the number of staff members, intensified training for staff and developed programs to help combat the issue, according to the study.A brief issued by UW-Madison highlighted the changes the university has made as a result of the study. These changes include the addition of three staff members to the Violence Prevention and Survivor Services Unit on campus and the requirement that all first-year and transfer students attend an in-person violence prevention workshop to supplement the online Tonight program, which has been required since 2014.

Having come from the tumor that resulted in her death, HeLa cells were found by doctors to possess truly groundbreaking qualities. The cells had an extreme durability that allowed them to be multiplied indefinitely, as opposed to most other human cells that die after a given number of multiplications. For the first time in history, scientists had an immortal line of human cells, making it possible to test and retest at end until medical solutions for some of our most problematic and deadly diseases and illnesses were found. HeLa cells have been credited to the invention of the polio vaccine, furthering the understanding of a myriad of cancers, as well as AIDS and HPV. They continue to be at the forefront and foundation of scientific research.But whilst, as the film phrases, the cultivation and distribution at mass of HeLa cells “gave birth to the biomedical industry,” the Lacks family had absolutely no knowledge that their own relative was contributing to such incredible medical advancements. Deborah Lacks, one of Henrietta's daughters, hadn’t even known what type of cancer took her mother’s life. Since her mother’s death, she had a yearning to understand her mother’s fate and ever since finding out about the HeLa cells from a chance conversation, a yearning to understand not only the science behind HeLa but the legality and mistreatment her family continued to suffer from ever since.In the original novel, the major scientific advancement that HeLa provided the medical world with was greatly expanded on, bringing a tremendous sense of wonder, amazement and understanding about what HeLa has done, and can do, for us. Though it is natural that details are to be cut in a film spanning only 90 minutes, the brief flashing of newspaper headlines and short narration of the importance of HeLa cells in the beginning of the film seemed hardly sufficient in conveying the scientific miracle at hand. The minute flashbacks to a young Henrietta scarcely do justice to the suffering Lacks experienced and the racist mistreatment and brutal treatments she received from doctors when she fell ill. In addition, the novel goes to great lengths to illustrate each member of the Lacks family’s individual sufferings (both mentally and financially) that make the distrust between them and medical officials, as well as the sympathy between them and the readers, all the more crucial to understanding the story at large, as well as massive parts of Deborah’s suffering. The film, in comparison, provides only small, rushed flashbacks in an attempt to build those dynamics found in the novel, leaving an unsatisfying incompletion of side stories that were rich and pertinent to the overarching narrative. Perhaps it would have been beneficial for the Lacks’ stories to span a few episodes rather than one film.However, where the film lacks those intricate details, it picks up with Oprah Winfrey’s outstanding performance as Deborah Lacks. Remembering the novel, I knew that Lacks would not be an easy character to play, as she is often confused at her own stance on many of the situations regarding her family and her mother’s cells. Deborah’s past with teenage pregnancy, sexual assault, domestic violence and other familial deaths, along with speculation of having schizophrenia, leads to her frequent manic episodes in which she internally battles pushing past the racial mistreatment of the medical world on both her mother and herself to find the truth. When Skloot comes into her life, asking for these very details in order to publish a novel on the Lacks’ story, this internal struggle comes into play, leaving Deborah both exasperated and enthusiastic—a duality that seems quite difficult to convey. Winfrey nailed her performance of Lacks, turning the focal point of the film to Deborah’s complex story. Winfrey was rich and passionate in illustrating Deborah’s struggle, bringing raw emotions to the character. I felt extreme compassion at more dynamic and compelling levels watching the film than I had whilst reading the novel. Though the film and novel seek to play upon the developing relationship between Skloot, the ambitious journalist, and Deborah, the struggling daughter, in many ways Winfrey overpowered Rose Byrne (Rebecca Skloot), the latter playing a seemingly passive role throughout.About halfway through the film, I found myself watching solely for Winfrey’s performance. While Winfrey had a truly beautiful portrayal that paid rightful tribute to Deborah Lacks, I had hoped to see more about Henrietta as a woman of color who contributed so much to the medical world unwillingly and unknowingly. As Skloot says tenderly in the film, “Deborah, there isn’t a person alive who hasn’t benefited from your mother’s cells.” For the science junkies who wish to know more about Henrietta’s experiences and the science behind HeLa cells in general, pick up a copy of the novel. The book also dives deeper into the chaotic and intertwined familial relationships that make up the Lacks family. For those who want to skip to the film, prepare for Winfrey to move you to tears with her heartbreaking performance, but know there is more to every story, especially that of the immortal Henrietta Lacks.""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" premieres tonight at 8 p.m. on HBO.",TV Preview: HBO’s ‘The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks’ condenses story but thrives with Oprah,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/04/fellowship-encourages-spreading-the-wisconsin-idea,"April 17, 2017 | 9:02am CDT","Former UW-Madison President Charles Van Hise defined the Wisconsin Idea as a goal: He wanted the university to impact lives throughout the state. UW-Madison freshman Caroline Hanson kept this message in mind while creating a project that focused on the issue of food insecurity on the local level, which she said is often overlooked “in people’s own backyard.”Hanson’s idea—The Patio Tomato Project—distributes fresh tomatoes to low-income families in the Madison area. She will also offer them educational materials about maintaining tomato plants and culinary ideas. Her project is moving forward with financial help from a grant she was awarded, along with six other students or groups, through the Wisconsin Idea Fellowship.The WIF awards roughly seven fellowships annually and aids students in implementing service projects that will impact the campus and beyond. The program, which is open to students who hold sophomore to senior standing, offers logistical assistance as well as up to $7,000 in funding. It connects participants with a community partner and a UW-Madison faculty or academic staff advisor to address social problems that have been identified locally, nationally and globally, according to Wisconsin Idea Fellowship Graduate Assistant Garrett Grainger.“The whole notion of the Wisconsin Idea is to make the university and benefits of the university accessible beyond the ivory tower and to the residents of the state,” Grainger said. “We’re trying to use the resources of the students … we want to give [the grants] to them so they can go out into the community and address problems that the community is identifying as relevant and needs to be resolved.”For The Patio Tomato Project, Hanson teamed up with The River Food Pantry and was advised by Jeri Barak-Cunningham, an associate professor in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. Barak-Cunningham has assisted in growing tomatoes, which they plan to distribute at community events and at parks in low-income Madison neighborhoods. They will send messages about the benefits of vegetables to children heavily and distribute further information about the produce.“We’re hoping we can increase that connection that people used to have to where their food comes from,” Hanson said. “There’s been a disconnect between … food that comes from the supermarket, what is this, how was it made. We’re really hoping to bridge that gap that has been forming.”Another recipient of the WIF will also target younger people, but instead of promoting healthy diets, UW-Madison senior Morgan Sanger and sophomore Renee Olley will encourage middle school girls to pursue careers in science, technologies, engineering and mathematics fields.Their project, Eva the Engineer: Young Girls at the Intersection of Engineering and Sustainability, will engage small groups of female students at Badger Rock Middle School in several educational and interactive sessions about civil engineering. Sanger and Olley partnered with the Wisconsin Concrete Pavement Association, who will be involved in offering the students hands-on learning experiences about the use of recycled materials in concrete.“Starting them at such a young age, we can make an impact in the Madison area where we encourage and inspire these young girls to see themselves as engineers or scientists,” Sanger said. “Then, likely, some of them will stay in the Madison area and it will keep it a rich intellectual culture that we have with the university here. I’m hoping it has both individual impacts on the girls and lasting community impacts as well.”One other group is keeping their project close to campus. Lauren Silber and Maddie Zimmerman are working with the UW-Madison student organization Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment to facilitate workshops that “outline the meat and potatoes of dating violence,” according to Zimmerman.Through research, the duo discovered there are several programs at UW-Madison that offer services or material focusing on sexual assault, but none that discuss dating violence specifically. The team connected with Domestic Abuse Intervention Services, a Madison nonprofit organization, to form Relationships For Leaders, Advocates and Greek Students“We talk a little bit about the statistics surrounding dating violence, bystander intervention and general red flags of dating violence,” Zimmerman said. “We're pretty specified in our material. We're not giving into the sexual assault world … we're really trying to focus on dating violence because that seems like the most tangible relatable issue for college students.”Each of the students interviewed said they plan to continue expanding their projects, collaborate with more individuals and groups, and will maintain their work for years to come.“Van Hise, when he was talking about the Wisconsin Idea, he really wanted the impact to reach every family in the state of Wisconsin, and people have been interpreting that to mean every family in the world,” Hanson said. “We’re bringing the Wisconsin idea home by targeting those families in the state and following Van Hise’s intention.”",Fellowship encourages spreading the Wisconsin Idea,UWM

Anderson, 23, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide for Nesbitt’s death.Madison Police Department Detective Pedro Ortega-Mendoza testified that Nesbitt—who turned 46 on the day of his death—was found by a roommate on a bare mattress in his North Butler Street apartment. Pictures were knocked over in the bedroom, but there were no other signs of a struggle noted in the apartment, he said.In a criminal complaint, Tranchida said a photograph of wounds on Anderson’s fingers led him to believe they were caused by a knife sliding in Anderson’s hand as it was being used.However, in court, Tranchida testified Nesbitt had wounds to the palms of his hands, indicating he had tried to grab the knife as he defended himself.Many of the wounds Nesbitt suffered were to his back and many were very deep, indicating force was used to inflict them, Tranchida said. That force, combined with blood, could have caused the knife handle to be slick enough to slip through the hand of Nesbitt’s assailant and cause the kind of cuts seen on Anderson’s hand.An oral swab taken from Anderson after his arrest matched the DNA from the blood droplets found in the kitchen of the apartment, according to Ortega-Mendoza.Authorities have not yet said what motivation Anderson may have had for killing Nesbitt.Anderson has a long record of run-ins with law enforcement, MPD Public Information Officer Joel DeSpain told the State Journal.Anderson was found guilty of punching and choking his girlfriend in 2013, which led to misdemeanor convictions for battery and bail jumping.In October 2015, Anderson allegedly started a fight with his roommate in Portage after being denied a cigarette, leading to two disorderly conduct charges that are currently pending in Columbia County. One month later, while working at McDonald’s in Portage, he was accused of causing a disturbance in the restaurant before he hit the supervisor in the head and damaged an employee’s cellphone.In 2016, he was convicted of fourth-degree sexual assault for grabbing a nurse inappropriately at St. Mary’s Hospital.He will enter pleas to charges against him for Nesbitt’s death at a later date.",Downtown Madison homicide victim suffered about 70 knife wounds,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/04/pave-debunks-myths-during-sexual-assault-awareness-month,"April 11, 2017 | 9:01pm CDT","April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, or SAAM. The National Sexual Violence Resource Center (NSVRC) has a goal during the month “to raise public awareness about sexual violence and to educate communities on how to prevent it” and they recognize that this is only possible with help from others. As a part of the group PAVE, it is our hope to get students on our campus to know what sexual assault is.PAVE, Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment, is a student advocacy group on the UW-Madison campus dedicated to ending sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking through education and activism. With this mission in mind, and specifically because April is SAAM, it is important to know that sexual assault can occur in many different forms and that victims and survivors have many resources to help support them. Moreover, students should also know that not everyone’s experiences are the same, but are valid nonetheless. Especially on college campuses, it is necessary to know that there are no cookie-cutter sexual assault experiences. Therefore, it is pertinent to debunk myths that people typically have about sexual assault.For instance, one of the most talked about myths is that most assault occur at night because someone is walking alone or is walking somewhere they should not be. However, according to NSVRC, about 55 percent of rape or sexual assault victimizations occur at the victim’s home while another 12 percent occur at the house of someone they know well. It is important to remember that a person can indeed be victimized by someone they know, including an intimate partner, and their experience can still be equally as traumatizing as if the assaulter was a stranger.With that said, it is also necessary to note that everyone responds differently to trauma. For example, some people may respond with laughter, some by crying, and some people will not know how to react and may show no emotion. Another big myth that NSVRC is trying to bust is the idea that wearing revealing clothes, drinking a lot, or behaving provocatively means that the victim was “asking for it.” This is never true, because it is never the victim’s fault. Behavior and clothing never imply consent to a sexual activity. This is important to remember when living on a college campus, especially one like UW-Madison where the drinking culture is so predominant.According to national surveys, about 20 percent of female-identifying college age students experience a sexual assault during their time in school. The most recent numbers on sexual assault reporting for UW system campuses is from the 2014 calendar year’s University of Wisconsin System Annual Report on Sexual Assault and Harassment. In that report, UW-Madison totaled 172 of the 461 reported sexual assaults. In a perfect world, this number would be zero. But we do not live in a perfect world, so the best we can do is work together to lower the numbers. Our culture, especially with the party culture that can be seen on college campuses, expects sexual assault to be an issue. It does not have to be, though; it is possible to change the current culture. If everyone works toward a new environment in which there is fewer sexual assaults, we can start to talk about a culture without sexual assault at all.There are resources right here on campus for victims of sexual violence. University Health Services has several programs, such as UHS End Violence on Campus (EVOC), Counseling and Consultation Services, and Medical services as well. There are also helplines available for survivors and their loved ones: National Domestic Violence Helpline (1-800-799-7233), National Sexual Assault Helpline (1-800-656-4673), UHS (1-608-265-5600), and the Dane County Rape Crisis Center (1-608-251-7273). All of the above resources are confidential. For more information on local and national resources, please visit  pave-uw.com.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/04/netflixs-13-reasons-why-tackles-the-complexities-of-teenage-suffering,"April 10, 2017 | 6:00am CDT","When Jay Asher’s teen fiction novel, “13 Reasons Why,” first came out in 2007, I was among the many who were immediately engrossed with the New York Times bestseller. When first hearing that the page-turner would be hitting Netflix screens, all of us “13 Reasons Why” fans around the world were, rightfully so, intrigued. As a story that is filled with taboo topics, and with it being as intimate, intense and personal as it is, many us were questioning how these words and passages would play out on screen.For those who didn’t have the chance to immerse themselves in drama-filled mystery, “13 Reasons Why” tells the story of why high schooler Hannah Baker decides to end her life, but there comes a twist with the way she chooses to do so. Before Hannah commits suicide, she decides to leave behind 13 cassette tapes; each tape illustrates a story, relationship (or lack thereof) and overall reason why her life ended after snowballing out of control. Most of those who are on Hannah’s cassettes are blatantly aware of their misdoing to Hannah, but when sweet and shy Clay Jensen receives the tapes, he is more than confused as to what he might’ve done to contribute to Hannah’s suicide.“13 Reasons Why” tackles hard topics: suicide, sexual assault, domestic violence and slut-shaming, to name a few. These topics are, and will always be, pressing themes that should be addressed and talked about within our society; awareness for those affected by such hardships should always be a forefront. That being said, it should be recognized that the Netflix series does not hold back in depicting many of the above topics. With the controversy surrounding the series’ graphic portrayals of these issues, it is recommended that those who have a history with any of these themes take caution and consideration in viewing the series, as certain scenes have been found to be highly sensitive.But, despite the controversy, the television show, created by Brian Yorkey, did an exemplary job of recreating Hannah’s story to shed light on how even the smallest acts of bullying can make a big impact on an individual's life, and how you should never assume anything of another individual because he or she could be going through a multitude of problems hidden behind a smiling face in the hallways. Both are issues that are bound to hit home and resonate with many young adults around the world, as it did popularly when the novel first came out 10 years ago.As Clay listens to each cassette day by day, I found it impossible to stop myself from eagerly binging through episodes, pushing the “play next episode” button immediately, one after another. With the ability to attribute a whole hour-long episode to each person that Hannah deems a reason why, rather than the 24 hours that Clay uses to listen to all the tapes in the book, the Netflix series was able to introduce new storylines that readers of the novel had not encountered before, leaving them pleasantly surprised.Without giving away any spoilers, an added dynamic for Clay’s character involves confrontation and investigation about the rest of the reasons why. This take on Clay’s journey learning and coping with Hannah’s death allows the audience to see the duality and complexity hidden within Hannah’s stories. Viewers can now gain a more intimate understanding of the characters and their background stories beyond only what Hannah speaks of on her cassettes in the novel. A few characters whose storylines prove exceptionally gripping, especially to those who have read the book, are Jessica Davis, Justin Foley and Tony Padilla. Additionally, the series embeds a desire for justice for Hannah in its storyline through both Clay and Hannah’s parents, adding to its overall intrigue and appeal.Seeing the series adapt and expand aspects of the book in new ways will have lovers of Asher’s bestseller completely engrossed with its interpretations. Likewise, newcomers will get the pleasure of watching the mystery unfold for the first time but, most importantly, they will get the chance to fall in love with Hannah for the first time as well. Hannah’s story brings us back to first kisses, crushes and love for each heartbreaking aspect on her tape and, before you know it, you too will have watched the entire series within a few days.",Netflix’s ‘13 Reasons Why’ tackles the complexities of teenage suffering,UWM

Scott Walker’s proposal Thursday that would have allowed UW System students to opt out of paying segregated fees.The committee co-chaired by state Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, and state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, suggested to consider the 83 removed items as non-budget legislation in standing committees, according to a letter sent to other members of the committee.The proposal to allow students to opt-out of segregated fees can still get passed in the future, but would not be a part of the 2017-’19 budget.Proponents of the opt-out have argued that it would allow students to save money by not paying fees that could go toward funding groups they don’t use or support.The Associated Students of Madison, along with UW System Student Representatives, however, have campaigned against the proposal. The Legislative Affairs Committee orchestrated the campaign “Save Our Orgs” and argued that the proposal could mean the end of essential groups like Badger Catholic, Working Class Student Union, Sex-Out-Loud and the student government, which serves as the student shared governance body.“Removing the opt-out from the state budget is a huge win for Wisconsin students,” said Sally Rohrer, the chair of the Associated Students of Madison’s Legislative Affairs committee.Rohrer emphasized in a statement how student services that are funded by segregated fees act as outlets for diverse student groups to have a voice on campus.During a Joint Finance Committee hearing in UW-Platteville Tuesday, members of ASM joined other UW System students to express their concern over the opt-out and request its removal from the budget.“Because of the actions of Sen. Darling and Rep. Nygren, survivors of sexual assault won’t lose health resources, students who have no good transportation options will still be able to ride the bus across campus and student organizations won’t have to charge money to members in order to operate,” Rohrer said.Other policy items removed include requiring campuses to establish a plan for students to receive three-year degrees, freedom of expression throughout the UW System and establishing provisions on faculty teaching workload. Requirements that students have an internship or other work experience before graduation also will no longer be a part of the budget.The committee also struck a requirement for public and private voucher schools that ensures they teach a certain amount of hours.

Boasting an 80,000-circulation daily newspaper, two weekly print publications, a magazine and scores of radio shows, TV stations and blogs, citizens on the isthmus have a plethora of options to help keep them informed.Given this crowded media landscape, it is easy to see how The Daily Cardinal can get lost in the shuffle. Yet for 125 years, the paper has carved out its niche by broadcasting the voices of students across the campus, city and nation.Capturing the student voice is harder for journalists who don’t live, study and work on campus, according to Nico Savidge, higher education reporter for the Wisconsin State Journal. Savidge, also a Cardinal alum, notes that he still reads the paper, as well as its competitor, the Badger Herald, as part of his beat.“Now that I’m covering the UW, I’m reading the Cardinal to get a sense of what students are talking about, to get a sense of what are the issues affecting students at UW-Madison and are shaping their experiences there,” Savidge said. “I think the paper does a really good job of that—it’s valuable for me to read as a reporter.”Despite the many information sources available to students, Savidge says the paper is still able to make an impact on the community by leveraging its proximity to student life.“What makes a good student paper is one that I think understands its role in the media ecosystem of its readers and understands where its advantages are, and I do think that’s something the Cardinal does very well,” Savidge said.“Students are going to have access to a lot of different sources of news,” he added. “Your advantage as a student paper is that you know those students better than just about any other news outlet, just by being one. So using that knowledge to make coverage that is relevant to those students is something that makes a good college paper.”That coverage can often take on statewide and national importance. Recent stories on the formation of an alt-right group and repeated sexual assaults at UW-Madison have been covered by national news outlets. Those issues are quick to resonate for campuses nationwide that struggle with issues of race relations and sexual assault.Virtually all of those topics are not new, and generations of college students have been reading about scandals in university administration, human interest pieces about campus activists and thrilling accounts of Badger athletic victories.Kevin Warnke, who served as campus news editor at the Cardinal in 2003, said headlines from his time on the paper would not look out of place to the student journalists of today.“You tend to see issues come to the forefront in cycles,” he said.Warnke and Cardinal reporter Anna Gould were responsible for one of the most notorious stories in the paper’s history; they discovered alterations to a photo featured in a university admissions brochure, showing the university added a black student, Diallo Shabazz, to a crowd of white fans at a Badger football game in an effort to portray diversity.The resulting firestorm was picked up by newspapers across the country, with the Cardinal leading the way, both in its original reporting and in its ensuing editorials.Warnke noted that the controversy brought conversations surrounding diversity into the mainstream, forcing students who would otherwise ignore the topic to confront racial inequality on campus.“For the vast majority students who were white, they felt that this wasn’t an issue that concerned them,” Warnke said. “Once the story broke, I think people had to confront that this was tarnishing the image of the university in the eyes of people across the country … I think a lot of people were forced to stop and consider what it meant that their university had this experience.”The piece also prompted students at college nationwide to more closely examine admissions materials, and many were able to uncover similar subterfuge. The University of Idaho and Auburn University were among the schools forced to apologize after similarly adding minority students to their brochures.Even though the university administration was embarrassed by the incident, Warnke said they respected the mission of the paper to bring about the truth.“It was a professional relationship, and it was always one guided by journalism,” Warnke said. “We would ask tough questions and push them in uncomfortable directions and it would lead to some awkward conversations, but, at the end of the day, they knew we had a job to do and we weren’t going to relent.” ","Despite crowded Madison media market, Cardinal stands out in campus community",UWM

Edwards at UW-River Falls in February.“He hit the nail on the head, he talked about toxic masculinity and how the society that we live in makes it acceptable to have these behaviors,” Coker said. “That's what I'm hoping to address this week, that we need to get to the root of the issue. The root of the issue is toxic masculinity, that we live in a culture of rape.”ASM is hosting It’s On Us Week of Action, which includes events Monday through Saturday and features groups like the UW-Madison Army Reserve Officer Training Corps, First Wave and Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment.Monday and Wednesday’s events involve screenings of two sexual assault documentaries, followed by discussions facilitated by Army ROTC and PAVE.One of the feature events is Thursday’s “Dear Masculinity” Letter Writing Workshop, which is exclusively for people who identify as men. The goal of having participants address letters to their masculinity is to show men how multifaceted it is.By reaching out to men, Coker and ASM hope to reach a group of students who generally do not receive as many messages about preventing sexual assault.“With a lot of recent research about how sexual assault happens on college campuses, it was found that more often than not sexual assault happens because consent isn't given,” Coker said. “People don't understand what consent is. I think talking about masculinity could definitely work to alleviate that issue.”The week’s programming will finish up with a Green Dot training designed to implement the bystander intervention strategy adopted by the university. The goal of this event is to again emphasize the role of the entire student body in combating sexual assault.“The issue of sexual assault is not just the issue of two people: It's an issue of the entire community,” Coker said. “It's on all of us to end rape culture.”",ASM’s week of action puts focus on ‘toxic masculinity’,UWM

WBTT Incoming Students Committee Leader Rachel Nicolaison is running the “Share Your Why” campaign, which aims to create open conversations on sexual assault through personal storytelling.

“We want people to get more of the personal touch which is often missing from the conversation,” Nicolaison said. “People talk about sexual assault logistically with the ‘one in four,’ but we want to put stories to those numbers.”

The campaign launched with the online hashtag “#shareyourwhy” and will continue throughout the month with drop boxes for students to write and read personal letters on why they feel it is important to have a voice in the discussion of sexual assault.

The boxes will be put in several locations on campus, including Helen C. White Library and both student unions beginning Tuesday.

Journals will also be placed in several campus hot spots including Espresso Royale and Allen Centennial Gardens. Additionally, there is a link to Tumblr on the WBTT Facebook page for students to share stories online.

“The entries are encouraged to be anonymous,” Nicolaison said. “We are hoping the personal writing, thoughts and responses will create a new dialogue for students on campus.”

PAVE will be hosting multiple events throughout the month to inform and support students who have experienced sexual assault or want to learn more about it.

Marissa Dempsey, PAVE communications coordinator, said the outreach done in April for SAAM is a great opportunity for students to understand the effects sexual assault can have on loved ones and to better know how to support them.

“It’s important because the issue is getting more coverage and in more ears and makes people recognize issues right here on campus,” Dempsey said. “Instead of feeling scared or unsure, they can feel some agency to be an activist and an ally.”

Other resources available to students during April include University Health Services End Violence on Campus, which will have trained members from their violence prevention and victim advocacy team attending events for additional services and support.",Sexual assault awareness month sparks creative events from student organizations,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/city-council-candidates-under-pressure-to-tackle-sexual-assault-on-campus,"March 27, 2017 | 8:01am CDT","In a January city council candidate forum, a UW-Madison student raised her hand to ask a question that seemed to catch both Zach Wood and John Terry Jr.—who are vying for a seat representing campus—off guard: “What would you do to combat sexual assault?”Addressing sexual violence in Madison hasn’t typically been a focal point in past Common Council elections, but after two high-profile cases involving numerous allegations of sexual assault and stalking shook the UW-Madison campus in 2016, students are putting the issue on candidates running for District 8.Incumbent Ald. Zach Wood, who has held the seat since 2015, thinks sexual assault has always been a big issue on campus, but said more can be done now that people are talking about it.“I think that now that it has a name, a lot of very good attention put on it and a lot of efforts to combat it, we are having a greater community-wide discussion about it,” Wood said.Addressing sexual assault and combating it, he said, are two different things. Wood said that combating the issue is complicated, and that there are “a lot of different components” to it, but he has some ideas.“There are a few [assaults] that happen in very public areas,” Wood said. “I supported cameras in the State and Langdon area. This will help in a select few cases.”Cameras would help identify assaults that happen in public areas, Wood said, but noted that “the vast majority” of sexual assaults happen behind closed doors, in dorms and apartments. To address them, he said the number one thing we can do is to take survivors seriously.“As a student who graduated in 2015, I know several [of my friends] have talked to me about their experience, and they are not necessarily taken seriously,” Wood said.Along with having security cameras on the street and taking survivors seriously, Wood also emphasized the importance of collaboration between the city and the university.“The city needs to work with the university, the students and the student organizations we have,” he said. “Everybody needs to play a part. It is such a complicated issue, and we only combat rape culture when everybody stays engaged and has this dialogue.”John Terry Jr.—Wood’s challenger— is a former homeless man and a current Madison resident. Terry decided to run for District 8 to bring his perspective of what it is like to be homeless to the government and make affordable housing more readily available to all residents.Although Terry’s main focus is on helping the homeless and providing affordable housing to community members, the candidate said he is learning more about sexual assault as his campaign progresses.“About a month ago I had a debate with Zach Wood, and a question was given to me about sexual assault. I did not know how to answer that,” said Terry. “I said: education, walk in pairs, do not become too intoxicated—things like that.”Since his debate, Terry said he’s changed his views on the topic and how to combat it. After speaking to community members and contacting student organizations to gain more insight into sexual assault, Terry now says sexual assault is “a big issue” and “will not be tolerated.”Terry proposed putting more cameras around the city, as well as having community groups patrol “high-risk” areas like Langdon Street.Terry views fraternities as one of the main sources of sexual assault. To combat campus rape culture, Terry said he wants to institute punishments for fraternities with members that have been charged with assault.“What I would like to see happen is that if a fraternity member is found guilty [of sexual assault], the whole frat house should be shut down,” Terry said. “The city needs to be more involved instead of just the university.”The city council election is April 4.",City council candidates under pressure to tackle sexual assault on campus,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/lets-talk-sex,"March 27, 2017 | 6:00am CDT","*Before I start this article, I want to begin with a consent caveat. Everything discussed in this article is clearly pointing to all sexual activities between consenting partners. A full definition of consent given by Sex Out Loud states “Consent is the clear, freely-given, informed, enthusiastic, continuous presence of a yes and not the absence of a no.”*
I’m not going to lie to you. As you can assume, being so open about sex all the time does not come without judgment from those surrounding me. While I originally was nervous to post and share my articles on my social media due to being friends with older adults as well as past teachers, I found that a lot of the people who were hesitant at first to click my links were more of my college-age connections. Comments like, “What Sydney? You just talk and write about sex all day?” and “Wait but what does your family think?” consistently have surrounded me since I first took over this column. While I wouldn’t say my dad particularly loves that his daughter is a sex columnist, I also wouldn’t say it is the bane of his existence (also if we’re talking even older; my grandfather recently informed me that he shares my articles with his colleagues because he’s proud of me, regardless of content, so take that, Judgmental Judies). Whenever I have a new article published and I feel that twinge of nervousness in my stomach after sharing it on my Facebook feed, I have to check and ask myself, ‘why’? When I am re-posting other articles about various topics like politics, beauty, life, etc., I never am nervous about what my followers will think. However, when it comes to my own very open articles about sex, I have a fear of others’ comments. This alone reminds me exactly why I have chosen the path that I have—sex is still such a weighted topic in our society due to the way we have socially constructed certain connotations surrounding these activities. Sex is taught to the public to be taboo, something you will most likely engage in during your lifetime but something you should not speak about unless behind closed doors. This hush-hush mentality, and thus a lack of education on the topic, has led to a plethora of problems including high rates of STIs, high rates of sexual assault and rape as well as unwanted pregnancies.
To me, sex has never been a topic I have feared speaking about. While I know there is a time and a place deemed appropriate for certain speech (something about social cues and filters I’m supposed to have??), I have always been able to talk openly with my mother, as well as with my friends, about sex. In my mind, sex is sex; just another part of life (like exercising, going to a fun class, etc.), another activity almost everyone I know is engaging in quite often. I have observed, often in large groups, people become super shy when sex is brought up and others boast about how great their sex lives are while silently shaming others in the room if they aren’t experiencing the same type of sex. However, behind closed doors, those people have also been the first to ask me certain clarification questions and admit they told lies when surrounded by others. Why do we feel the need to make every sexual experience into something bigger than it is? Countless times my girl friends have come home after a hookup and relay how amazing it was and then a couple months later talk about that same experience negatively, claiming “whiskey dick” ruined the sex or something else (I am not excluding myself from this behavior FYI, I have definitely fluffed up a sexual encounter due to pressure I’ve felt from others). But why do we do this? Where is this pressure coming from? If we have had a sexual encounter that wasn’t something to write home about, why are we telling our friends the opposite? And, vice versa, if we consistently engage in mind-blowing, incredible sex (props to us), why do we feel the need to push that in the faces of others when they discuss their own experiences quite differently? In my opinion, we need to place an emphasis on normalizing sex as a part of conversation, instead of treating it like a dangerous taboo, and in turn we will eventually see a dramatic reduction in rates of STIs, sexual assaults and hopefully an increase in positive, educated dialogue amongst parents and children as well as teachers and students in sex education classes.
While I am by no means saying that everyone should always be having sex or must always want to engage in sexual activities (we need to welcome and acknowledge our asexual friends, our abstinent friends and also educate ourselves on certain age restraints and laws put in place to protect us), I am just saying that the way sex is discussed in general needs to shift.   When we talk about sex, when we cancel out the negativity surrounding it and instead educate those with pleasure-inclusive curriculum, we then can lessen all of the “hoopla” surrounding this activity. The less we look at sex as an activity that can only be performed by certain people, at certain times, in a certain way, the more potential we have to educate those around us about the basic human right to enjoy our lives.
The way most of us are taught to talk about sex growing up can directly correlate to a lot of young peoples’ tendencies to lie about their sexual encounters. Whether we are lying about the number of partners we had or have not had, how frequently we are having sex or when talking about the things we like in bed, at some point in our lives we will find (or already have found) ourselves fibbing about something. For example, I know a lot of young sexually active women that lie to their gynecologists about the number of partners they have had due to embarrassment of that amount being deemed socially “too high.” I also know a lot of young sexually active men that talk with their guy friends about any sort of anal play in bed, deeming it as a negative activity and using the words “that is so gay” when in reality they love a good finger (or toy) up their butt in private.
These two examples bring up sexual myths we love spreading that could be stopped if we encourage open dialogue about sex. For the first example, the number of partners a person has should not be something we use to judge others for. There is no legitimized standard set for the limit to the number of people you should be having sex with. You set those limits for yourself. If you are happy with yourself and genuinely enjoy having a lot of different partners, good for you! If you are more comfortable only having sex with a few people in your life that is also awesome! What we define as too many or too few partners should be something only we have a say in. The second one points to the myth that if a person with a penis engages in any sort of butt play during sex they are automatically gay (one caveat before I debunk this, what the fuck is wrong with being gay?). Regardless of whether you are having sex with same gender or opposite gender partners, this myth needs to be debunked. Everyone has a butt and it can be pleasurable for everyone as long as you are educated on what you are doing, being hygienic and using lots of lube. A heterosexual man that enjoys his female partners playing with his butt does not need a label on him staking him as “gay,” if he is simply just a person with a penis enjoying sex as is his right just like it is everyone’s right that wants it. You would never hear a gay man negatively claiming that sex with a vagina is “so straight” so think about what you are saying before you say it.
If you cringed once while reading this article or identified with some of the examples I threw on the table, this shows exactly why the quality of sex education needs to shift greatly for the generations below us. Many of us in our 20s and older received abstinence-only sex education, no sex education at all or basic sex education which was non-pleasure inclusive and focused on anatomy. For some, these types of sex-education made sex seem like a scary but intriguing and appealingly bad behavior we were tempted to engage in as young people, similar to exploring with alcohol and drugs. We were told we shouldn’t be doing it, which made a lot of us want to do it more. Like I said before, this rabbit-hole explains high rates of STIs on college campuses and high rates of sexual assault among young people as well. If we can shift the way sex is taught to young people and make it sound less scary but place a higher emphasis on open dialogue and education, the generations below us will be able to condone their sex lives in a much smarter way than we did.
Long story short, let’s stop making sex weird. Instead, let’s be able to talk about sex in the same breath we are using to talk about an interesting class we went to or a fun museum exhibit we visited. Seems like we’re all doing it, let’s not be afraid to discuss it.

Maybe it sparked a discussion between yourself and some of your friends? Have any thoughts or comments? Even any ideas for future sex columns?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/how-ptsd-affects-sexual-assault-survivors,"March 15, 2017 | 1:26pm CDT","Those who experience an emotional trauma are at a greater risk for revictimization due in part to an onset of post traumatic stress disorder. But, a stronger understanding of the human brain’s processes may help reduce the risk and severity of these symptoms, thereby reducing the risk for revictimization, researchers say.The general model of PTSD would predict hypervigilance in individuals who have already undergone a trauma, but that is not always the case, explained Josh Cisler, the principal investigator of the Neurocircuitry of Trauma and PTSD lab.This is the phenomenon of revictimization, which refers to the notion that those who experience abuse once in their past are likely to experience it again. A survivor’s social behaviors change, putting them at a greater risk for experiencing another attack; they may be less self-assertive or judge situations differently, often perceiving them as less dangerous.Cisler’s research takes a twist on the more holistic approach to PTSD by focusing on neurocircuitry responses after undergoing sexual assault and how that psychopathology may place someone at a greater risk for revictimization.“Most people don’t talk about this problem … the ultimate goal would be that the work that we do informs some kind of treatment,” Cisler said.Ninety-four percent of sexual assault survivors develop symptoms of PTSD after an attack and 30 percent sustain those symptoms on some spectrum of severity up to nine months later.Cisler emphasized that those who feel they have a solid support system often heal faster.“One of the best protectors against PTSD is social support,” Cisler said, explaining that a survivor should feel they have people they can open up to. “The act of disclosing is certainly helpful but it’s more so …. making sure that [they’ve] got a group of friends to turn.”Cisler’s study coordinator, Karyn Esbensen, added that the more self-blame a woman has for her assault, the more severe the symptoms may be.“Avoiding victim-blaming is really important so women who have been victimized by sexual assault don’t internalize that,” Esbensen said.If a person is conscious during a sexual assault, regardless of intoxication, their fear circuitry kicks in and immediately dominates brain functioning. Instantly, the prefrontal cortex is impaired due to a rush of stress chemicals, affecting the individual’s ability to think rationally.The person’s reflex responses take control; in other words fight, flight or freeze. During the fear circuitry response, freeze often dominates.The freezing response occurs when the amygdala first detects an attack, signalling the brainstem to stop all movement. It acts as a primer for the fight or flight, but neither necessarily follow.In most traumatic situations, like for members of the military mid-battle, responses are well-trained, nearly conditioned responses. While still susceptible to PTSD, soldiers have formed effective habit responses which help lift themselves out of the freeze stage more quickly.During the fear circuitry, a survivor must rely only on their innate responses, which are primarily social. This process, since not well-trained, often ignores fight or flight responses and allows extreme survival reflexes to dominate. Survivors may describe a dissociation from oneself—a feeling of autopilot control—or other forms of immobility that hinder their ability to speak or cause them to pass out.What the fear circuitry focused on during the assault may influence central details in the memory of a survivor. These memories, although often recalls of seemingly miniscule details like the pattern of wallpaper, are more likely to be accurate and consistent and often become highly valued during investigations.Fear acts most commonly on the hippocampus’ ability to encode and store contextual information and time sequencing. Some studies suggest that the hippocampus temporarily enters a super-encoding stage right when the fear kicks in, leading to a nearly perfect recall of events just before and after the attack. However, memories of the attack, encoded when the brain ended its super-encoding mode, tend to be fragmented and incomplete.In order to gain a stronger understanding of these phenomenon, Cisler’s lab is currently recruiting study participants. Women who have experienced physical or sexual abuse and are between the ages of 21 and 50 are encouraged to reach out to the NeuroTaP Lab.“The more bad things happen to you, the more likely you are to have [other] bad things happen to you,” Cisler said, explaining abuse is a risk factor for mental disorders in addition to cancers and other diseases. “So if we can stop that cycle of violence, or victimization, then we can decrease that risk.”",How PTSD affects sexual assault survivors,UWM

But one study shows that sexual assault is especially prevalent on the days of home football games at Division I universities with passionate fanbases.In other words, schools like UW-Madison.The study, conducted by Jason Lindo of Texas A&M University and published by the Bureau of Economic Research in 2015, found 41 percent more sexual assaults are reported on game days at Division I universities than on average Saturdays. It raised questions about the impact of big-time sports on campus safety, leaving people wondering whether college football does more harm than good at American universities.The UW-Madison Police Department does not keep data regarding the number of sexual assaults reported on game days specifically. However, national data has raised some concern in the UW-Madison community that Badger games could breed high levels of sexual assault and rape.Skeptics of Lindo’s study point out that football games are generally on Saturdays, when a large number of students would be drinking anyway. However, the study claims “the control variables included in our baseline model account for potential bias driven by inherent differences across agency jurisdictions as well as spikes in sexual assault related to the day of the week, specific holidays, and the calendar year.”The study also found “upset wins increase reports of rape by 38 percent more than games in which the team lost according to expectations,” further suggesting the actual influence of football on levels of sexual assault.What is unclear, though, is the significance of this finding. Marc Lovicott, UWPD’s director of communications, said the department hasn’t noticed that reports of sexual assault spike on game days, but he would not be surprised if that is the case—because it all boils down to alcohol use.“I don’t know if we’ve actually tracked the correlation between football game days and sexual assault, so it’s hard for us to tell,” Lovicott said. “But looking at a report that came out about a year ago regarding sexual assault even on this campus, a majority of the sexual assaults that we deal with and that are reported on campus, have to do in one way or another with alcohol.”Lovicott said that the department is “very busy” on game days, and that it gives out more citations than an average day of the weekend, but that the department “certainly hasn’t noticed [a] trend in particular” between football Saturdays and increased levels of sexual assault.Lovicott also stressed that while alcohol use is often a catalyst for sexual violence, the most important factor is assailants’ lack of understanding when it comes to issues of consent.“The number one factor is consent. People need to learn the definition of consent,” Lovicott said. “But aside from that, alcohol does seem to be a big factor.”Whether there is something about football Saturdays that increases the prevalence of sexual assault, or whether these increases are simply a coincidence based on other circumstances, alcohol use—a staple of Badgers games—is highly correlated with sexual violence on campus.",Sexual assault rates spike on football Saturdays at many schools.

However, student groups at UW-Madison and activist groups around the country have voiced their concerns about the legislation for a variety of reasons, including its potential to actually increase levels of sexual assault on campus.The Campaign to Keep Guns Off Campus, an organization that works against the proliferation of firearms at universities, released a report on the subject comparing the rates of several violent crimes on campuses with and without campus carry.The study, carried out by researchers at the organization, found an increase in crime rates at the universities with campus carry, even while the student population was in decline, and notably high rates of forcible rape compared to schools without such legislation in effect.“While the results certainly do not prove that campus carry causes more crime; it undoubtedly disproves the claim that the possible presence of individuals carrying concealed weapons equals less crime,” the study reads.The study examined campuses in Utah and Colorado, states with campus carry laws in effect, and determined that rape “remains a problem on college campuses,” one that “concealed handguns cannot fix.”“The goals of our state legislators should not be arming more individuals, but educating students at a younger age about the dangers of drugs and alcohol related to sexual assault and the need to teach individuals to respect each other,” the report concludes.Students at UW-Madison have organized against the passage of the legislation, including circulating petitions, engaging passersby in discussion and taking part in the Cocks Not Glocks campaign, a viral protest method that originated at the University of Texas at Austin, in which students publicly carry sex toys to protest campus carry efforts.“I think campus carry would have a really, really, really bad effect on the already very bleak numbers we see on sexual assault on campus,” said Kat Kerwin, head of the Cocks Not Glocks campaign at UW-Madison.A late 2015 survey found that almost one in four female undergraduates at UW-Madison had been sexually assaulted while attending college.“It would just allow violent people a very easy and very legal way to have a weapon and defense if they are going to sexually assault others,” Kerwin said.Rep. Jesse Kremer, R-Kewaskum, originally introduced the legislation in 2015, but the Assembly did not vote on the bill before the end of the session.UW System leaders and police have also come out against campus carry legislation.Police chiefs representing every UW campus signed a letter to Kremer in 2015, urging him to reconsider the legislation.“Guns do not belong in our classrooms, student centers, laboratories, workout facilities, locker rooms, offices, residence halls or athletic venues,” the letter reads.Kremer has voiced continued support for the legislation and encouraged others to advocate for the cause as well, stating in a press conference, “We need people who are passionate about these issues who think they are a real problem to come out and support these [solutions]. That’s a problem we had last session.”Last November, state Republicans won 11 new Assembly seats, granting them a 64-35 majority, their largest in decades, and leaving little institutional opposition to the party’s legislative agenda. However, some Republican leaders have acknowledged skepticism about the effectiveness of campus carry, and have deemed it necessary to build support and structure their legislative priorities before voting on the issue.""We actually need to work harder on some of these controversial topics to build public support to make sure, if we are doing it, we’re reflecting what Wisconsinites actually want,” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, said in a January press conference.Kremer has said he will likely reintroduce his bill during this year’s session.","Campus carry detrimental to sexual assault prevention, experts and UW leaders say",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/immediate-and-unquestioned-no-contact-orders-offer-alternatives-to-survivors,"March 15, 2017 | 6:46am CDT","Three weeks before she turned 18, former UW-Madison student Logan Johnson moved into Sellery Residence Hall in August 2013 to begin her freshman year of college.She said within two days she was sexually assaulted by someone she had met at a party. And in the 15 months between that incident and her decision to report it, she said she was assaulted four more times: once again by the first alleged assailant, twice more by his fraternity brother and once by someone she used to call a friend.Johnson left Madison briefly and returned home to Milwaukee after the last reported assault in October 2014. She returned in January after missing class, and she moved into a dorm in the Lakeshore neighborhood upon arriving back on campus.“Being back in Madison has been hard for her. She has been fearful of seeing her old roommates and friends,” said Johnson’s mother in an email to Tonya Schmidt, assistant dean and director of conduct and community standards. “I just found out that she has not been attending any of her classes.”After filing a report with the Madison Police Department, Johnson met with Schmidt, who also opened a university investigation into the incidents.While the school’s investigation unfolded, Schmidt issued no contact directives to Johnson and the three assailants she’d named, rendering any further communication between Johnson and the alleged perpetrators off-limits by order of the university.This type of directive—which could jeopardize a student’s status at the university if violated—prohibits contact between two individuals ranging from intentional face-to-face meetings to liking each other’s Facebook photos.“You know, you get the notifications and it says ‘so-and-so liked your post,’” Schmidt explained. “Some people use that to control their victim.”Requests for no contact orders happen fairly often—about once every two weeks, Schmidt said. Reasons can be as simple as a roommate relationship gone sour, but they more commonly deal with dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.If contact is made, Schmidt said her office will review the incident and determine whether or not the incident happened intentionally.If it did—and each incident is considered separately—the student could receive a formal reprimand, one or two-year probation, suspension or expulsion in more extreme cases.Both parties receive the same message ordering all communication to stop. In cases like Johnson’s, that means both the reporter and alleged perpetrator are given the same instructions, a component of the directive Schmidt said has received pushback from advocates who claim it is retaliatory against victims. However, she explained it is simply part of a concerted effort to preserve the sanctity of exactly what “no contact” means.“In actuality, we’re really just trying to make sure that everybody understands that there can no longer be contact between each other,” Schmidt said. “It also helps keep the investigation impartial.”In August 2015, a few months after both Madison police and the university closed Johnson’s case without enough evidence to yield consequences for the three men involved, one of her alleged assailants moved into her apartment building.Although the no contact order still functions off-campus, Schmidt admitted it is harder to monitor, especially if both parties live in the same apartment complex.“There’s not a whole lot we can do,” she said. “We can put some extra restrictions, like don’t go into the gym between four and six and the other person’s going to be told they can’t go between six and eight, things like that to try to alleviate the contact that’s going to happen.”Johnson felt the contact was so intrusive that she filed for a formal injunction with the city of Madison. She said it was “very scary for me to be alone with him in the building.”“He constantly is looking at me and has stopped trying to avoid me when he see’s (sic) me,” Johnson wrote when she filed for the injunction, a document obtained by The Daily Cardinal.She received the injunction from the court, but was unable to get the assailant removed from her building.In other cases, Schmidt explained that the no contact order functions as a way to prevent the need for such a formal action, especially given the fact that a restraining order or injunction hearing requires both parties to be in attendance—and those reporting assault often do not want to see their assailants.Schmidt said the no contact directive would not be a perfect fit in every scenario, but also stressed that with the university directive, there’s no need for students to rehash every detail of their experience and it likely won’t trigger any sort of investigation.She said the only exception is if one of the student’s names had come up in a previous misconduct case, usually dealing with sexual assault reports. Then, because she and her staff are mandatory reporters, the university would be required to open an investigation. It’s a rare case, she added, that has only happened two or three times in the last few years.The entire process is usually settled with only a brief description and a request.“We need to know the gist of it, not, ‘Take me through this horrible experience that you’ve had.’ If you tell me, ‘I’ve been sexually assaulted by this person and would like a no contact directive,’ boom,” Schmidt said. “We will do it.”Nina Bertelsen and Peter Coutu contributed to this report.",Immediate and unquestioned: No contact orders offer alternatives to survivors,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/balancing-act-inclusivity-in-sexual-assault-prevention-remains-illusive,"March 15, 2017 | 6:42am CDT","Although the statistical majority of perpetrators are men, anyone can be a survivor of sexual assault. On campus, addressing survivors holding identities other than straight women is complex.The 2015 UW-Madison AAU Campus Climate Survey revealed 16 percent of non-heterosexual males and 43 percent of non-heterosexual females experienced sexual misconduct and/or assault during their time on campus. Transgender and gender non-binary people were not accounted for due to low numbers. Though the chance of being raped is higher for individuals holding one of these identities, the odds of seeing preventative campaigns and non-heteronormative dialogue is low.The UW-Madison Police Department launched the “Don’t Be That Guy” campaign in 2015, which targeted male perpetrators with heteronormative imagery. In one image a woman glances at the camera in distress, a man’s arm around her, with the photo captioned, “Getting drunk doesn’t give you permission to take advantage of someone.” Another advertisement features a woman, passed out in bed on a couch, with the words “Consent is clearly yes—not the absence of no.”According to UWPD spokesperson Marc Lovicott, the campaign was based off the recent Campus Climate survey, reporting 98 percent of perpetrators are male.Lovicott said UWPD worked with the LGBT Campus Center on this initiative and the department felt the Center’s campaigns were sufficient for other types of sexual assault prevention tactics.At University Health Services, staff work to provide wide-ranging prevention and care.Last year, this led to an additional requirement for all incoming students. The Wise workshops are the Tonight program’s in-person component, with topics ranging from dating, sex, LGBT specific topics and coping strategies for survivors of sexual assault.Within UHS, mental health services are implementing an LGBT-specific counselor as well.These changes, UHS End Violence on Campus Director Carmen Juniper Neimeko said, aim to go deeper than Tonight and provide a “more trauma-informed and trauma-sensitive approach.”Aside from these changes, however, further steps are unclear.For UWPD, the “Don’t Be That Guy” campaign will remain unchanged. Other initiatives such as the “Tell Us” campaign, Lovicott explained, feature male and female offenders, which the department sees as inclusive.Juniper Neimeko, on the other hand, said addressing the issue of inclusion while also focusing on the statistical main source of the problem is multifaceted.“Most perpetrators are gender-conforming, are cis[gender]-men, are straight men, who have access to sex and who perpetuate, both against other men and women and that doesn’t go away,” Juniper Neimeko said. “So doing targeted interventions that address gender in a gender binary might not be super inclusive, but it might address a reality.”“I hear people when they say, ‘that doesn’t feel like I got represented.’ I hear you,” Juniper Neimeko said.In the program utilized before Tonight in the late 2000s, one of the scenarios involved included a male-on-male assault. This backfired, according to Juniper Neimeko, resulting in greater homophobia from straight men who viewed the program, which at the time came in male and female viewing formats.“So what does that mean, to be inclusive when it causes harm?” Juniper Neimeko said.Nevertheless, changes have been implemented to open up the Tonight program, re-recording voice-overs to “remove the gender binary,” as Juniper Neimeko explained, and working with students in an LBGT capstone class to re-evaluate the program’s effectiveness. They found that many grapple with the desire to be represented and the fear of that action only reinforcing LGBT stereotypes in non-LGBT viewers.Juniper Neimeko said a lot of work still needs to be done.“When we think at UHS about working to prevent perpetration, we think through a public health lens, which both honors the experiences of individual survivors, but works to push the needle across the broad pervasiveness of the issue and that’s a hard balancing act,” Juniper Neimeko said.“Every survivor deserves care and compassion and choice.”",‘Balancing act’: inclusivity in sexual assault prevention remains illusive,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/with-possible-changes-to-burden-of-proof-fewer-campus-assailants-may-be-found-responsible,"March 15, 2017 | 6:40am CDT","After a night of drinking, a UW-Madison student was sexually assaulted in a campus dorm room. She didn’t recall much about the evening, but she remembered vomiting in the dorm’s trash can.The student reported the assault to the university’s Office of Compliance, which then investigated the incident. Investigators spoke to the alleged assailant’s roommate, who had noticed the vomit the next morning. The roommate said the reported assailant had told him the young woman “may have spit up.”Under current campus standards of sexual assault, this was enough for administrators to corroborate the survivor’s story and find the defendant responsible, according to Tonya Schmidt, the director of UW-Madison’s Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards.But now, some on campus are worried that President Donald Trump’s administration may change standards for college sexual assault cases, making the reporting process more difficult for some survivors.Currently, when UW-Madison administrators examine a case of sexual assault, they weigh evidence against standard of “preponderance” before entering a decision.“Preponderance of evidence means it's more likely than not that the incident occurred,” Schmidt said. “A tip of the scale that one side is more credible than others … some people say 50 percent and a feather.”According to Schmidt, there is no prescribed type or amount of evidence investigators need in order to find the accused party responsible. She said sometimes a student may provide a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner, the names of friends they told after the assault or saved text messages that could make one side more credible.However, there isn’t always a factor that tips the scale.“You have to look at credibility of everyone who is giving information in the situation … There are a lot of factors,” Schmidt said. “[But] often times it does come to, ‘Ugh, who do I believe more.’”David Blom, UW-Madison’s Title IX coordinator, handles all sexual assault reports made to the university. If a survivor wants to proceed to an investigation after the initial report, Blom will reach out to a contractor and begin a co-investigation.The contract investigator, usually a retired police officer, then begins to gather information from that incident. They may collect any physical evidence from the reporter, attempt to recover security footage from residence halls, or talk to witnesses and friends.“We do typically have something, even if it's just ‘I woke up and told my roommate I have blood in my underwear and I didn't know what happened,’” Schmidt said. “There’s usually something, but it's not a smoking gun, it’s not a ‘gotcha.’”The compiled report is then given to each party so they have a chance to refute any statements before it is passed on to Schmidt’s office for decision. The investigator and two members of Schmidt’s office must decide if preponderance is met before a nonacademic misconduct hearing panel decides the level of punishment: probation, suspension or expulsion.Sometimes there simply isn't enough information to find a defendant responsible, and Schmidt said those are the times panel members lose sleep wondering if they made the right decision.“Those are the hard ones for us. We don't think people are coming forward and lying about it, we just also know that without the information we in good faith can't go forward,” Schmidt said. “It doesn't mean we don't believe them, it just means we don't have the information.”In 2016, UW-Madison rendered responsible verdicts in six of 15 cases that proceeded to an investigation, and since 2011, the school’s overall rate is approximately 50 percent.However, this rate may decrease sharply if national standards change.Up until a few years ago, many college campuses used the “clear and convincing evidence” standard to determine responsibility in sexual assault cases. This standard requires 75 percent certainty of the accused party’s guilt, as opposed to the “50 percent and a feather” required under the preponderance standard.However, in 2011 the Department of Education began a push to get universities to switch to the weaker preponderance standard, as part of an effort to increase rates of sexual assault reporting on campuses. Under a federal mandate, colleges risked losing federal funding if they did not comply with the national guidelines.UW-Madison had already switched to the preponderance standard in 2009. The university was “trying to do the right thing before it was even dictated,” Schmidt said.But critics of the weaker standard argue that “the right thing” denies alleged assailants their right to due process. For example, members of the law faculties at Harvard, Stanford and New York Universities signed a letter last year protesting the Obama administration’s insistence on campus use of the preponderance standard. The letter accused the Department of Education of “[curtailing] a number of due process protections for students accused of sexual assault.”They were concerned a lower standard would lead to false responsible verdicts that would unduly damage the alleged assailant’s standing.“A low standard of proof is inappropriate in situations involving damage to one's reputation,"" the letter reads. “Free speech and due process on campus are now imperiled.”Trump’s appointment of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education has given opponents of the preponderance standard hope for a return to old policies. When asked in her confirmation hearing if she would uphold Obama administration’s guidelines for determining responsibility, DeVos said “it would be premature” to make that commitment.The Trump administration’s next steps regarding campus sexual assault standards are unclear, but Schmidt said the Obama administration’s shift away from the “clear and convincing” standard has helped her office “come a long way” in bringing sexual assailants to justice.""I've been so happy that we finally got that support on a national level, for us to be able to do what we've always known is right,” Schmidt said. ""And it's sometimes hard to convince people when it's not a federal mandate that it's right.""","With possible changes to burden of proof, fewer campus assailants may be found responsible",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/advocates-say-common-stereotypes-of-the-perfect-victim-dont-encompass-survivors-experiences-of-sexual-assault,"March 15, 2017 | 6:08am CDT","After leaving a party her freshman year, UW-Madison student Alexandra Adams was sexually assaulted by a friend she had a crush on.The next morning, he dismissively tossed her clothing on the bed and didn’t say goodbye as she left his apartment.It wasn’t until a conversation with her nurse practitioner months after the party that Adams began using the word “assault” to describe her experience.“She said, ‘I don’t want to label this for you, but it sounds like assault to me,’ and I was like wow, yeah it really was. I wasn’t cool with everything that was going on. He masked disrespect in this very charismatic, opportunistic way, and it took me the rest of freshman year, and probably up until now, to make sense of it,” Adams said.The prevailing narrative around sexual assault is that women are in danger of sexual violence from strangers lurking in dark alleys, parking lots and bushes, according to Melanie Murchison, a professor in the UW-Madison legal studies department.However, data reveals the threat may lie closer to home.About 60 percent of reported sexual assaults at UW-Madison were committed by a friend or acquaintance of the survivor, according to a 2015 American Association of Universities’ survey. But the cultural narrative around sexual assault de-legitimizes women assaulted by someone close to them, UHS Violence prevention and Survivor Services Team Manager Carmen Juniper Neimeko said.“People are taught to believe that rape is when someone out of the bushes forces you down to the ground and it’s really violent and there is a gun,” Juniper Neimeko said. “If that’s our dominant narrative, and what happened to you is the last thing you remember was dancing, and then kind of making out and you woke up without clothes on next to this guy you’ve had a crush on for three months, how does that fit into your dominant narrative and what you’ve been taught to believe?”Adams echoed this sentiment, stating she sometimes wonders if she has the right to call herself a survivor of sexual assault.“There’s a textbook definition for sexual assault or rape. Sometimes I feel like I don’t fit,” Adams said. “Like there’s someone who experienced worse physical pain than I did, or more emotional pain than I did.”Murchison said portrayals of sexual assault in the media perpetuate false stereotypes about survivors, sending a belittling message to survivors of acquaintance assault that may also affect reporting rates.“We create a vision of perfect victims who have done nothing wrong and who could not have in any way expected or prevented their victimization,” said Murchison.This portrayal has real consequences for how survivors view themselves, and the culture of reporting, according to both Juniper Neimeko and Murchison. This was the case with Adams, who said she didn’t feel represented in both media coverage and conversations on campus surrounding sexual assault.“When they talk about assault on the news, it’s often about successful penetration or sometimes goes down to the detail of what exactly happened in the violation, that’s something that sometimes I don’t feel like I’ve met,” Adams. “It’s a feeling of not being hurt enough to qualify.”Last fall semester, UW-Madison student Alec Cook garnered national media attention after being accused and subsequently arrested for several violent sexual assaults. Nearly a dozen women have since come forward to report him, and he faces 21 criminal charges.News coverage of the violence in Cook’s case has been explicitly described—with words like “choked,” “strangulation” and “tormented”—but Murchison said the reports have actually helped dispel the myth of a “perfect victim.”“I think in some ways the Alec Cook coverage was good in that it reinforced that this might be the person in your classroom, this might be a person that you know,” Murchison said. “I think it was a wake-up call to a lot of individuals who thought that this happened in the movies or bad neighborhoods or bad people, but actually this happens to my neighbor or my classmate, and this is perpetrated by my neighbor or my classmate.”Following Cook’s arrest, the university and UW-Madison Police Department put out additional information about how to combat rape culture and report assaults, which Murchison said helped dispel common and harmful rape myths.At UW-Madison, acquaintance rape is not uncommon. And Juniper Neimeko thinks it may be an even more common than reporting rates reveal.Twenty percent of sexual assaults facilitated by alcohol were committed by a partner or someone the survivor had previously been intimate with, according to the AAU campus climate survey. Almost 90 percent of sexual assaults at UW-Madison took place in either the victim or the perpetrators home.This survey—which found that more than 25 percent of women at UW-Madison would be sexually assaulted during their time on campus—showed that the majority of survivors did not ever report their assault to university or police officials. Adams, who has mutual friends with her assailant, never reported her experience.And students are even less likely to report sexual assault committed by someone they are close to, especially when the assault occurs between two individuals within the same friend group, according to Juniper Neimeko.Murchison said the myth that rape most often occurs at the hands of a stranger, has been used to control women’s freedom and reduce a person’s autonomy.“The idea that they should be afraid in parking lots or dark alleys or when there’s lots of bushes, that they should always have a buddy with them, it really limits their self-confidence,” said Murchison. “Women report having lower levels of self-confidence than men, and I think that’s part of a socialization issue. We teach women to be afraid.”Marissa Dempsey, communications chair for Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment, echoed this sentiment, adding that the belief in this myth contributes to a broader culture of sexism.“We often talk about how women should be scared and often are scared walking down the street, and I think it might be something to do with power and control,” Dempsey said. “While not all victims are female and not all perpetrators are men, it has a kind of misogynistic quality to it.”Dempsey added that belief in this rape myth may make it more difficult for bystanders to recognize when a sexual assault has occurred between two friends.University Health Services aims to educate students about the realities of sexual assault through the Tonight program, which teaches first-year students intervention tactics by addressing popular rape myths.The core issue that Tonight tries to address is that “people manipulating trust and friendship and courtship to gain access to people’s bodies” is sexual assault, said Juniper Neimeko.The Tonight program names the red flags Juniper Neimeko said are “not a dark path in the woods, but as the cute guy at the party who is filling your beer cup up so repeatedly you actually don’t know how much you are drinking.”Adams’ experience of sexual assault largely falls in-line with Juniper Neimeko’s description rather than what Murchison described as popular portrayals in media. Adams also stressed the importance for education about consent, as she still does not know if her assailant realizes that she did not consent to the experience.“Rapists hide in the shadow of what seems to be friendly … in order to render their victims incapacitated and useless so they can use their bodies,” Juniper Neimeko said.",Advocates say common stereotypes of the ‘perfect victim’ don’t encompass survivors’ experiences of sexual assault,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/a-cultural-shift-is-required-to-fix-or-change-rape-culture,"March 15, 2017 | 8:44am CDT","Rape and the fear of rape is a part of the American college experience for women. On American college campuses, one in four undergraduate women will be sexually assaulted or raped by the time they graduate. Indicated by UW-Madison’s Association of American Universities Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assault Climate Survey, our precious UW-Madison is no exception, with 27.6 percent of undergraduate female students reporting experiencing nonconsensual penetration or sexual touching. This climate survey had over 9,000 respondents, reflecting over 22 percent participation on campus—far more participants than in similar surveys by other institutions. As women, we are taught to walk in pairs or triples, carry pepper spray, learn self-defense, walk in well-lit areas, and go to the bathroom together, all to prevent being sexually assaulted. Even within the first week of being at UW, I was warned never to go on “Rapeshore” path. To change rape culture we need to think about sexual assault realistically. Sexual assault and rape hardly ever happens by a stranger in a dark alley that you will never see again. Life is not “Law and Order: SVU.” To change rape culture, there needs to be a change in how rape is talked about. To most people, a sexual assailant or a rapist looks like Alec Cook —a diabolical stranger. However, UW-Madison’s recent AAU Campus Climate report reiterated a commonly known fact about rape, that perpetrators “were overwhelmingly identified as fellow students who are male, often a friend or acquaintance.” The perpetrator is a friend, a boyfriend, a Tinder fling, a lab partner, a classmate, a neighbor, etc. At UW, perpetuation usually starts at a party, and often ends up at the dorms. The perpetrator is often a drunk college man. Why? On most American college campuses, alcohol is a key factor in sexual assaults. And expectedly at UW, recently named as the number one party school in the U.S., alcohol also plays a key role in sexual assaults. The aforementioned report also indicated that female students who experienced nonconsensual penetration (ie. rape) indicated that “the offender was drinking alcohol 76.1 percent of the time.” However, at UW there is an additional factor: Greek life. The same report indicated “assaults were disproportionately reported in Greek residences.” It was found that over 25 percent of sexual assaults reported to UWPD in 2015 happened on Langdon Street, or “frat row.” Taking into account rules enforced on sorority houses that are not enforced on fraternity houses—like guest visitation limits, curfew and the lack of alcohol at parties—it becomes easier to pinpoint where these sexual assaults happen. However, finding out where sexual assaults happen was never an issue—it’s Langdon and residence halls. The report also indicated “assaults most commonly occurred in student residences such as private apartments and campus residence halls.” In 2015, about 25 percent of reported sexual assaults to UW-Madison Police Department happened in the residence halls, particularly ones with majority freshmen populations. We should be asking: Why these locations? What do they have in common? How are these locations related? The answer: They house and welcome primarily male and heteronormative communities and there is access to and the encouragement of experimentation with alcohol. These places are not necessarily filled with bad men, rather these men were not getting consent. When talking about a sexual assault or rape survivor, the focus is on them and what they did wrong, if they were dressed or acting a certain way. We should be asking the perpetrator: Did you get consent? Did you get a clear and direct “yes”? With the combination of alcohol and the encouragement of hypermasculinity, rape culture broods—there is entitlement to women’s bodies. There is no need or acknowledgment of consent. The root of rape culture is hypermasculinity. Men often have to prove their masculinity, and often times is proved involving violence against women. I have deduced all of this from my favorite speaker from UW-Riverfalls It’s On Us Summit, Keith Edwards. At this summit, over a hundred UW System leaders congregated for the purpose of learning about sexual assault as it pertains to college campuses. It was amazing to hear such wonderful speakers, like Edwards and Lynn Rosenthal, who served as the first White House Advisor on Violence Against Women from 2009-2015. It was also great to hear what other campuses and other students are doing to face these issues. From it I realized that one person alone cannot fix or change rape culture, it takes a cultural shift—an unlearning and relearning. We need to unlearn toxic masculinity and relearn something else. It is an issue if a quarter of all women who attend college will be sexually assaulted. This is a preventable issue. What can you do? Cut rape jokes, don’t negate people’s experience, and most importantly check your friends. If you see someone is way too drunk to do anything, do not let them go away with a stranger. Take that last drink from someone. If your friend is being creepy, tell him to back off. Walk someone home. Don’t be a passive bystander, and we’ll all take a big step in the right direction.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/wisconsin-works-to-fight-against-backlog-of-thousands-of-untested-rape-kits,"March 15, 2017 | 10:15am CDT","Amid heavy criticism over a seemingly lack of urgency to process 6,000 untested rape kits throughout Wisconsin, the state’s Department of Justice has pursued a goal of collecting and processing all kits while maintaining a survivor-centered approach.In comparison to other efforts around the country, many cities but rarely entire states have taken on the challenge of processing all untested kits. In Detroit alone, there are over 11,000 untested kits. Michigan overall has 15,000 untested kits.By respecting survivors’ wishes and implementing a process with empowerment in mind, Wisconsin has emerged at the forefront of creating a solution to a system-wide challenge.BacklogsWhen an individual goes to a hospital facility after being sexually assaulted, a sexual assault evidence kit, also known as a rape kit, is usually created. The kit consists of samples of DNA and other pieces of evidence. Unlike most criminal cases, the evidence in sexual assault cases comes from the survivors’ bodies.After a traumatic crime like sexual assault, people would go to the hospital without knowing whether they wanted to report the assault to law enforcement. In those cases, and in cases where a victim absolutely did not want to report, hospitals would keep those kits or send them to law enforcement agencies in case the victim changed their minds.Oftentimes, for a variety of reasons, those kits go untested. These untested kits occupy shelf space in hospitals and law enforcement agencies that don’t want to throw the evidence out. Over time, the number of untested kits heads toward the thousands, a problem in every state.To tackle this problem Wisconsin’s former attorney general, J.B. Van Hollen, created a Sexual Assault Response Team in 2011, known as AG SART. The team discovered that hospitals and police agencies used different protocols to collect these kits, causing confusion about the whereabout of some kits.The gradual increase of untested rape kits caused what is now referred to as a backlog. A 2014 survey revealed that throughout Wisconsin’s 550 law enforcement agencies and various hospitals, there was a total of 6,000 untested kits.First stepsSART’s solution to the rape kit system's flaws incorporated changes from when the survivor visits the hospital until a conviction is reached. SART created a universal form for all hospitals that helped them sort kits depending on the survivor's wishes. Kits were redesigned with privacy in mind by matching each person with a barcode on their kit. For individuals who have a kit created but don’t decide to report until months or years later, they can call the number on their form and their kit will then be tested.The new protocol preserves the evidence in the kit for up to 10 years, allowing people to decide how they want to proceed on their own time. Some states can only hold kits for 30 days. Wisconsin has one of the longest holding periods in the country.SART also designed a campaign to get survivors who have had a kit created but don’t know its status to come forward. Instead of directly contacting all survivors who have an untested kit, some of whom were assaulted several years prior and didn’t want to know the results of their examination, SART created a “By Your Side” campaign which formally launched last month.“We have unique protocol where we are respecting victims wishes,” said Audrey Skwierawski, assistant attorney general and violence against women resource prosecutor. “We may not test all 6,000 because we don’t to violate victim’s trust in the system.”Despite the DOJ’s new protocol, the issue of how to test all 6,000 kits remained. DOJ’s crime lab tests nearly 900 kits a year for ongoing cases.“There is no ‘backlog’ there. We are right on top of every case being sent to us,” Skwierawski said. “The issue is 6,000 were never sent to us.”Skwierawski explained the crime lab couldn’t handle the influx of kits while testing 900 recent kits at the same time. If the crime lab hired additional staff it still took two additional years to train them.In places like Detroit where all kits were tested regardless of survivors’ preferences, it has taken seven years and testing is still not finished.Grant moneyTo be able to test all the kits and hire more staff, the DOJ applied for two grants in 2015, each offering $2 million. Wisconsin was one of a handful of states that received funding from both grants. Some cities with major backlog challenges, such as Houston and Detroit, received both grants but for a state to receive the funding was fairly unprecedented.One grant from the New York County District Attorney allocated money solely for testing kits. The Bureau of Justice Assistant gave half of the funds for testing kits and the other half for putting together a committee of prosecutors and advocates.The grant also required the DOJ to take inventory of every kit in the entire state before they released their funds. Most grant recipients are cities or counties where this process can go quickly. To take inventory of a whole state, however, is more difficult.CriticismThe DOJ finished Wisconsin’s kit inventory this month. The process to collect data on every kit in the state’s 550 law enforcement agencies and various hospitals started in March 2016.During this process of collecting inventory with $4 million in funding, USA Today reported only nine out of the 6,000 kits have been tested. The DOJ received severe backlashes for Attorney General Brad Schimel’s apparent lack of leadership and the copious amount of time the whole process has taken.“At this point in the backlog, the bottleneck is in the lab,” Skwierawski said. “We’ve sent two batches, one batch of 200 [kits] in January when the lab was ready and 200 in February. The next batch will be sent in March.”Four Democratic lawmakers sent Schimel a letter in February demanding answers from the DOJ while state Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, requested an audit of the kit backlog testing policies.Schimel, who announced that a few hundred kits had been tested when only nine had, has not responded to the letter.“First of all [lack of testing is] inexcusable and it’s hard to understand after 16 months of federal funds and $4 million there’s still 6,000 rape kits that haven’t been tested,” said state Rep. Katrina Shankland, D-Stevens Point, one of the authors of the letter.Another author of the letter, Rep. Gordon Hintz, D-Oshkosh, said he recognizes these kits have special circumstances depending on the survivor’s wishes but said that doesn’t justify the thousands that are untested.“A different narrative behind some might make sense [to not test] but not for all 6,000,” Hintz said. “For every kit that’s not tested you could have a serial rapist out there.”Skwierawski told The Daily Cardinal that Schimel was referring to the 200 untested kits sent to the crime lab in January and the phrase “kit testing” encompasses a multistep process.“It would make me angry if I didn’t know all the details,” Skwierawski said. “We don’t want people to feel like we aren’t taking this seriously and that it’s not important to us because it’s super important.”Future effortsWith the kit process’ past problems resolved, a sexual assault kit sent to the crime lab will typically be processed in two to six weeks depending on how long it takes the lab to find a usable profile. If that profile leads to a conviction the perpetrator’s DNA will be uploaded to a statewide and national database. The database can link violent crimes from around the country or state back to the perpetrator.The need to test these kits has received bipartisan support. Everyone wants to help survivors receive the closure and justice they deserve. This session, Shankland is planning on proposing legislation that would help survivors on college campuses throughout the state receive resources and information about what a rape kit is and how to navigate the legal process.Shankland also explained the need to pass legislation to allow survivors to track where their rape kit is immediately and years down the road.In the first week of March, the DOJ applied for a 2017 grant to continue their effort to process all untested kits. Part of that grant request included money for a kit tracking program.Other legislation from the Capitol that could help survivors include making it legally mandatory to test all backlogged kits, to test all kits presently and in the future, notify survivors the status of their cases and allocate funding for testing kits.Wisconsin has work to do, as does the rest of the country. Wisconsin, however, is at the forefront of a victim-centered approach in every procedure surrounding sexual assault, according to Skwierawski.Wisconsin is one of 15 states with a violence against women prosecutor and one of the earliest states to pioneer statewide initiatives to reach out to survivors to tackle the backlog using a flexible three-step hospital form to sort kits and a decade-long holding period. With protocols in place to ensure a backlog never happens again survivors also have more choices as to what happens after they seek help from a health care facility.“If you have the opportunity and courage to come forward and have a kit collected we are going to respect and we are going to make sure the right thing is done with that kit,” Skwierawski said.",Wisconsin works to fight against backlog of thousands of untested rape kits,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/a-tale-of-two-stories-as-state-federal-entities-work-to-combat-sexual-assault,"March 15, 2017 | 10:12am CDT","At a time when many aspects of the UW System have encountered politicization, increasing reporting and investigation of sexual assault on college campuses has become an area of bipartisan support at the Capitol.Both Republicans and Democrats signed onto a bill last session designed to make it easier for survivors who had been drinking to go to law enforcement. Advocates are pushing for further progress: providing more resources for survivors of sexual assault on campus and demanding the state Department of Justice do more to clear its backlog of rape kits.But at the same time, federal protections for sexual assault survivors are becoming more uncertain, with major pieces of former President Barack Obama’s legacy on the issue in danger of being rolled back under a Republican executive branch. While some cheer this as a potential win for civil liberties, others argue it will irreparably harm the experience of survivors nationwide.Progress in state LegislatureOne example is a bipartisan law approved last session which would exempt survivors or witnesses of sexual assault from punishment if they had been drinking underage. Authored by state Rep. Joan Ballweg, R-Markesan, and state Sen. Jerry Petrowski, R-Marathon, the measure was backed by UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, the UW-Madison Police Department and state Attorney General Brad Schimel.While Ballweg said that she hasn’t seen data yet on whether the law has increased reporting of sexual assault on campuses, UW-Madison announced last week that 325 sexual assaults were reported last year, a 50 percent increase from 2015.Other states with similar measures have seen an increase in reporting, Ballweg said.“Folks understand they do have amnesty,” Ballweg said. “I would think it’ll have a positive impact.”Before the law, many police departments, including UWPD, had guidelines stating they would not give drinking tickets to survivors or bystanders. But not every agency had such a policy in place, and because it was not codified into law, it was inconsistently enforced.“We see increases in numbers in other states that have done this, but the guideline wasn’t necessarily well known,” Ballweg said. “Students needed to know that this would be the same law whether they were in their dorm or off campus.”Cassidy Schroeder, chair of Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment at UW-Madison, said members of PAVE lobbied and worked with legislators on the bill.“It was cool to see our [staff members] lobbying and hanging out with these legislators who really cared,” Schroeder said. “And I was happy the bill had such bipartisan support, with everyone saying ‘Yes, this is a good rule.’”Empowered by this success, students are lobbying legislators for further action. Last month, UW System Student Representatives lobbied legislators on codifying a requirement that each campus have a violence prevention specialist, a trained advocate for survivors of sexual assault who would be required to report any crime to law enforcement.Some legislators, including state Rep. Jill Billings, D-La Crosse, have expressed support for the idea.“It should be addressed and if someone is in that situation, there should be someone there to help them and walk them through what's next; being respectful to the person who has suffered from assault and being an advocate,” Billings told The Daily Cardinal last month.Other lawmakers, including Ballweg, have said that they support providing advocates for survivors but that they would rather that aid come via non-profit groups.“Local non-profit sexual assault groups do offer services and we hope these partnerships can be made stronger so students can know how to seek help,” Ballweg said. “Victims aren’t always ready to go to law enforcement. So they need to know where they can go to get help for themselves.”Uncertainty at federal levelBut while state legislators seek out ways to improve reporting at Wisconsin campuses, the U.S. Department of Education has indicated it may be considering rolling back one of the principal protections for sexual assault survivors.Under the Obama Administration, Title IX was used as a powerful tool to ensure colleges took steps to improve the reporting and investigation of sexual assault on their campuses. Passed in 1972, Title IX states that no education program receiving federal aid can discriminate or exclude participants on the basis of gender.Until recently, that provision had not been associated with sexual assault and was perhaps most famous for increasing the visibility of women’s athletics at colleges nationwide. But in 2011, the U.S. Department of Education dropped the hammer on higher education.In the now infamous “Dear Colleague Letter,” the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights said sexual harassment and assault “interferes with students' right to receive an education free from discrimination and that schools must “take immediate and effective steps to end sexual harassment and sexual violence.""This interpretation of Title IX was cheered by advocates and dozens of universities, including UW-Madison, found themselves under investigation by the Department of Education for potential violations.“At a federal level it dictates a lot of the work college campuses do because there are repercussions,” Schroeder said, noting the Department of Education can fine campuses for violations and will work with schools to ensure protocols surrounding prevention, reporting and enforcement are strengthened.“Part of what they do, what I think is the positive, important spin on it … is to say ‘this is why your system isn’t working, here’s what you can do to fix it.’”But this could be set to change under the Trump administration. New Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has not confirmed whether or not she will change the 2011 guidance, saying at her confirmation hearing in January that it was “premature” to make such a statement.“If confirmed, I look forward to understanding the past actions and current situation better, and to ensuring that the intent of the law is actually carried out in a way that recognizes both the victim ... as well as those who are accused,” DeVos said at the hearing.And evangelical leader and Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. has indicated that he will use his position as chair of Trump’s higher education taskforce to roll back Title IX.“[Fallwell] has an interest in eliminating what he feels are overreaches by the federal government, particularly the Department of Education, as pertains to colleges and universities across the country,” Liberty University spokesperson Lee Stevens said after Falwell's appointment. “Title IX is one of the areas he mentioned where there is over-regulation.""Such moves have been cheered by civil liberties groups, who allege that guidelines set forth in the “Dear Colleague Letter” have gone too far and infringe on the due process rights of accused perpetrators. Multiple lawsuits challenging the policies have sprung up, including a 2016 suit from a University of Virginia law student who was expelled after having sex with an intoxicated student in 2013.“Following the law isn’t optional, and discontent with the 2011 ‘Dear Colleague’ letter is widespread and well-documented,” Foundation for Individual Rights in Education Executive Director Robert Shibley said. “Hardly a week goes by without new headlines pointing to the failure of the status quo on campus. OCR has acted as though decreasing due process rights will increase justice. In fact, the opposite is true. Real people’s lives are being irreparably harmed.”But advocates for survivors say that any legal or executive changes to Title IX would be a blow.“I like to think that even if Title IX was repealed, colleges truly have their students well-being at heart and I think the reason folks go into higher education is to help people,” Schroeder said.“I do worry about what that means if there is no higher power to hold people accountable,” she added, noting that “if you don’t have that enforcer or person who is neutral … I worry that won’t happen [if you roll back Title IX].”State lawmakers have said that they believe campuses should continue to track and report sexual assaults, even if federal sanctions are eliminated.“Whether the federal government is or not, the campus population as a whole is interested in maintaining data and they want to be sure they’re making progress in these areas,” Ballweg said, adding that she was “not familiar” of any instances in which accused perpetrators were not given due process rights.Schroeder said that she was hopeful the university would continue to maintain its higher standards and expressed confidence activists would hold administrators accountable.“I hope universities would make those choices and I hope activists on campus would push for those things and say that our campus isn’t safe to our students without x, y and z in place,” Schroeder said. “I hope that our universities would still protect students. Activism on this campus is incredible and it comes from so many places, and I would hope [the university] wouldn’t repeal the good things they started.”","A tale of two stories as state, federal entities work to combat sexual assault",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/greek-life-needs-to-take-a-more-serious-look-at-assault,"March 15, 2017 | 9:00am CDT","College campuses continue to boast horrifying statistics on sexual assault even with programs in place to help educate incoming students about how to identify and prevent high-risk situations in which sexual assault can occur. Representing a disproportionate percent of reported sexual assaults are Greek organizations on campus; longitudinal studies show fraternity men are three times more likely to commit sexual assault than other college men. As a man involved with Greek life at Madison, this statistic absolutely disgusts me and, like so many others, leaves me wondering what we can do to combat this. One in four women have reported experiencing sexual assault on campus and a majority of these cases report the assailant to be under the influence of alcohol. As a notorious drinking college, it’s no surprise that alcohol seems to play into the statistics regarding sexual assault. However, alcohol is not the only factor in the rising number of sexual assaults on campus, rather a history of misogynistic culture within fraternities takes a huge role in the degradation of women on campus. There has been an effort by the university and student organizations to bring awareness to the problem of sexual assault specifically within the Greek community. For example, there is a course offered titled Greek Men and Violence Prevention that is offered to men in fraternities. There are other organizations like We’re Better Than That that educate students about the dangers of sexual assault and violence and offer prevention techniques. Though these programs are a good step, they do not help promote anti-misogynistic ideals within individual Greek houses. Men in Greek communities at UW-Madison must make a wholehearted effort to protect potential victims by making sexual assault a serious issue within each chapter. It is easy for people to laugh at a joke taking a shot at women; however, it takes more bravery to stand against hate speech of any kind. Once sexual assault is actually taken seriously by each chapter on this campus, I would foresee the number of sexual assault reports to decline. I would advise chapter executive board members to take a zerotolerance approach to this issue and consider revoking membership and reporting perpetrators to the university. Though the statistics are frightening, I think it goes without saying that this is a blanket statement and does not mean that every person in Greek life is a bad person. The Greek community is filled with brilliant and innovative people. There are even leaders and activists who are a part of Greek life. So while I understand that Greek life represents a large sum of these statistics, let us not forget to give every single person the time of day and prove who they really are. Change will never happen if there are voices in the Greek community speaking against our cause. If misogyny is the popular opinion of a chapter, I believe the university and the chapter’s executive office need to look at the morals and fundamental standards of the group. We as a community must take a look in the mirror and stop blaming non-Greeks for being biased toward us; truth is, statistics don’t lie, and there might be a reason why Greek life can be so frowned upon. Above anything else, people need to learn to respect and honor other people’s wishes and feelings. By taking an introspective approach to battling sexual assault on campus, Greeks not only have the numbers but the passion to remove this evil from our beloved school.Gary is a sophomore majoring in communication sciences and disorders, as well as linguistics.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/segregated-fees-cut-endangers-resources,"March 15, 2017 | 8:00am CDT","Allocable segregated fees—the approximately $90 each UW-Madison student pays along with their tuition every year—go toward funding many clubs, resources and services across campus. However, according to the new budget proposal from Gov. Scott Walker, these fees will be made optional for students. While saving money may sound appealing, the loss of segregated fee income could be catastrophic for our campus community.While all organizations that rely on segregated fees for income are important, services that offer sexual health resources are especially important for the wellbeing and safety of students. Sex Out Loud, Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment and the Rape Crisis Center all heavily rely on funding from segregated fees to offer services to students such as free condoms and sex education, as well as resources and support for survivors of sexual assault.With diminishing segregated fees, our campus could lose integral sexual health resources like the ones listed above.PAVE—a student organization that focuses on empowering survivors of sexual assault—holds regular events featuring speakers on topics such as domestic abuse, stalking and overcoming challenges linked with sexual violence. They also have an office in the Student Activity Center, which is regularly staffed by trained students ready to help survivors of sexual assault.According to Cassidy Schroeder, student chair of PAVE, these resources could be slashed if students are given the option to opt out, possibly reducing available funding.“If funding is cut off and all of a sudden we don’t have segregated fees, our staff would have to downsize their time,” Schroeder said. “For instance, I work 20 hours a week and that’s paid. As a working class student, I wouldn’t be able to give this much time to the job if it wasn’t paid.”The Rape Crisis Center, an off-campus service with a campus component that offers 24-hour hotline help, as well as survivors’ advocacy and counseling services, is also heavily reliant upon funding from segregated fees. According to Jaime Sathasivam, if the funding they received was cut, they would have to downsize the scope of their 24-hour services.“We currently always have two layers of 24-hour services—one person to answer phone calls and one person to go to for medical advocacy if needed,” Sathasivam said. “However, we may have to cut that to one layer if our funding diminished.”Sexual health resources such as PAVE, Sex Out Loud and the Rape Crisis Center are absolutely integral for the health and safety of all students on campus. Their services offer peace of mind, as well as information for students who are potentially facing some of the darkest times of their lives.If such services were to be cut or downsized because of insufficient funds, students would be losing services that could change their lives.While PAVE and the Rape Crisis Center help offer support and resources to survivors of sexual assault, Sex Out Loud approaches sexual health resources in a more sex-positive and educational way. This perspective is also key in the prevention of sexual assault on campus, as well as a healthy view of sex among students. Sex Out Loud program facilitator Miriam Kelberg prides the organization on creating a consent culture on campus, something that we desperately need.“Reframing the question of what and who sex is for is integral to consent culture and equality,” Kelberg said.Sex Out Loud focuses on a sex-positive and pleasure-inclusive approach to sex, removing stigma from the topic in a way that they hope will create a more healthy view toward sex, and will hopefully also reduce sexual assault in the process by promoting consent. However, without funding from segregated fees, such education would be not as available.“We wouldn’t be able to do programs on campus, we wouldn’t be able to educate folks about [what] consent culture looks like, about condoms, about how we can check in with our partner about sexually transmitted infection testing,” Kelberg said. “None of that would be possible.”Segregated fees are divvied up and given to student organizations by the Associated Students of Madison’s Student Services Finance Committee through a pool called the General Student Services Fund under a system of viewpoint neutrality. This ensures that regardless of an organization’s beliefs, actions or leanings, their funding will not be affected, the ASM Grant Allocations Committee wrote in a Feb. 9 letter to the editor for The Daily Cardinal.“If the governor wants to argue that students should directly fund the events, travel and other expenses for the student organizations they do care about without having to pay for other things they don’t agree with, this doesn’t accomplish that,” the GAC said in the letter. “All this does is decrease the overall pool of funding that we have to pull from.”Sexual assault is a very real problem here at UW-Madison. Our students are affected at a rate that is higher than the national average. If we are to strip survivors of sexual assault of their resources on our campus, then we are only exacerbating the problem.If Walker and his administration truly want to better the student experience for thousands at UW-Madison, they will realize that the $90 we pay as segregated fees does more than just empty the pockets of students and their families.What are your thoughts on the impact that segregated fee changes will have?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/changing-the-playbook-coaches-must-bear-burden-of-sexual-assault-prevention-education-advocates-say,"March 15, 2017 | 8:00am CDT","In December 2016, when 10 members of the Minnesota football team were indefinitely suspended in connection to an alleged gang rape following the team’s season-opener, it took less than 48 hours for the rest of the team to announce a boycott of all football activities, including the Holiday Bowl.It wasn’t until two days later, amid intense public pressure and with the release of a damning, 80-page report of the university’s investigation, that the team ultimately backed down from its boycott.The Golden Gophers would play in the Holiday Bowl, to the delight of their fans, but the damage was done. The message was sent. The players had chosen to side with their teammates at the risk of normalizing sexual violence.The Minnesota football case was a microcosm of many of the issues surrounding athletics and sexual violence. Most profoundly evident in both the disturbing reports of the incident and in the boycott itself was the potential danger of that close-knit, familial bond among teammates. Jessica Luther, author of “Unsportsmanlike Conduct: College Football and the Politics of Rape,” says that when that team mentality goes unsupervised, it can have horrifying consequences.“[It’s] an incredibly close-knit group of men, which is good for those spaces to exist,” Luther said. “At the same time, we often see particular issues that come out of them when they remain unchecked … something like 40 percent [of cases studied in her book] involve multiple perpetrators, which is a super high percentage for gang rape.”It isn’t just a familial bond between teammates that leads athletes to sexual violence, though. A 2016 study by Jennifer McGovern and Patrick Murray found that student-athletes scored lower on a test of understanding sexual consent than the general college population. While the results were not statistically significant, the difference was there, across all demographic divisions.Luther said that the bulk of the blame for that lack of knowledge should land squarely on the shoulders of coaches and administrators in the athletic departments. According to her, the college athletics system is set up to encourage turning a blind eye to sexual violence in favor of on-field performance.“For a lot of people, we don't trust the people in charge to do the right work, we don’t trust them to do the preventative education,” Luther said. “The system itself, the way it's set up, doesn't encourage that. It encourages you to exploit these players for what they can do for you on the field, which in turn is good for your job security and good for your pocket book.”In an effort to combat this lack of education, FUTURES Without Violence, a 35-year old organization dedicated to preventing violence against women and girls, crafted the Coaching Boys into Men program in 2001. CBIM provides coaches with a “playbook” on how to talk about sexual assault and empowers them to use their influence to teach their athletes about healthy relationships and effective bystander behavior.The impact that the program had was swift and noticeable. In a 2012 study, Elizabeth Miller found a statistically significant increase among athletes that received CBIM in both knowledge of abusive behaviors and intentions to intervene. In schools where the program was implemented, Miller saw a decrease in the number of incidents of violence compared to schools that did not receive the program.“We've realized that coaches have such an incredible impact and influence on young men's lives,” Yesenia Gorbea, a senior program specialist with FUTURES, said. “That’s the number one protective factor in terms of the effectiveness of the program.”Through the program’s playbook, CBIM has harnessed the team mentality that often leads to violence and flipped the script, pushing student-athletes to teach one another and intervene when they see dangerous behavior.“Another protective factor that is really critical is the team in and of itself, being similar to a family system,” Gorbea said. “They’re more likely to intervene because they are going through this experience together. So leveraging the power of a team is also really critical.”Gorbea added that giving student-athletes the tools to educate each other is crucial to spreading awareness and mitigating sexual violence. That’s what makes groups like We’re Better Than That, a student organization at UW-Madison that seeks to bring men—including those in athletics—into the conversation about sexual violence, so important.We’re Better Than That hosts workshops and coordinates with other student-athlete organizations to give athletes a space for healthy discourse on prevention and awareness of sexual violence. Grace Wold, Vice President of We’re Better Than That and member of the UW swim and dive team, said that the athlete-to-athlete discussion they provide can be remarkably effective.“The fact that other athletes are hosting these workshops and being in front and talking with them, it makes it more relatable,” Wold said. “I think it’s really powerful.”She added that student-athletes carry a lot of social capital that they can use to educate other non-athletes on campus.“Especially on this campus, [athletes] are empowered leaders,” Wold said. “They’re people who care about their fellow Badgers and they want to make changes on campus towards that difference.”Luther echoed all the same sentiments about the influence that players can have at a school like UW.“They have a certain status on campus that other students just don’t have,” she said. “Those guys have literally the most recognizable faces on campus, more so than almost anyone, and so students listen to them, care about what they have to say.”But while she acknowledges the potential for change from within the student-athlete community, Luther firmly believes that to make a lasting improvement in the athletic social sphere, change has to come from the people at the top.“If we are paying attention and we are trying to respond, it often falls very much on them, the accountability of that single individual,” she said. “And not that that's not important, but I think it is important to always be asking about who at the top of the chain is making bad choices.”With the constant cycling of athletes in and out of the system year-to-year, it’s too dangerous to rely on individual student-athletes to create a paradigm shift in the culture of college athletics. To make an active change in the culture of sexual violence, coaches, athletic directors and other administrators have to take up the mantle.“If we're ever gonna fix this, it's not gonna be about one individual case,” Luther said.“If we're going to do the preventative work, it’s going to come from the people who don’t leave every four years.”","Changing the playbook: Coaches must bear burden of sexual assault prevention education, advocates say",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/with-4-title-ix-cases-under-investigation-groups-try-to-improve-handling-of-sexual-violence-on-campus,"March 15, 2017 | 5:51am CDT","UW-Madison is being investigated for four cases of mishandling reports of sexual violence—the second-most of any Big Ten school, after the University of Indiana’s five, and more than double the average of investigations for all Big Ten institutions.Student groups and university administration, faced with the possibility of these cases never being fully investigated, are working to fight sexual violence on campus.These investigations stem from possible Title IX violations, which were redefined in April 2011 when a letter that altered the landscape of Title IX enforcement and put almost every major university in some form of noncompliance was issued by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights.Title IX, the 1972 law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs, was—for the first 39 years of its existence—largely associated with the rise of women’s sports and extracurricular programs in schools across the country. In recent years, it has shifted to also focus on how universities handle sexual assault.Within three years of the letter, the OCR had released a list of 64 institutions that were under investigation for mishandling reports of sexual violence—this number has since grown to more than 200.UW-Madison was not on the initial list, but the OCR began investigating the university Feb. 24, 2015, for the first of four violations.Although the investigations are still open, the university has taken several steps to get in compliance with the new standards. Most significantly, David Blom was hired as the school’s first full-time Title IX coordinator in the summer of 2015, and took over the role of handling sexual assault investigations.“UW-Madison has made a concerted effort over the past several years to break down barriers to reporting and encourage more students to come forward and seek assistance,” said UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone.Changes were also made to the UW System, as the Board of Regents solicited student feedback on revisions to the UWS Chapter 17 policy instituted in spring 2016, which governs non-academic misconduct, including sexual violence. Prior to the revisions, Chapter 17 did not include definitions for dating violence, domestic violence or sexual harassment, and failed to ensure equal treatment for complainants and respondents in an investigation.Although progress has been made, some students said the university’s focus is on preserving its image rather than properly combating sexual assault.“They have an agenda, their agenda is to protect the reputation of a Big Ten school,” said Georgia Black, a UW-Madison student and sexual violence survivor advocate. “I don't believe we're gonna see any actual change on campus until their agenda aligns with what is right and moral, which is that sexual assault shouldn't be happening, and it should be persecuted.”Going forward, that change will likely have to begin on campus, as the Trump administration and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos have signalled their intentions to revise and potentially roll back the Obama administration’s Title IX guidance.“The Administration’s distortion of Title IX to micromanage the way colleges and universities deal with allegations of abuse contravenes our country’s legal traditions and must be halted,” the GOP’s 2016 platform said.The Department of Education issued a new letter Feb. 22 that directly contradicts the previous administration’s guidance on protections for transgender students. This has lead some Title IX activists and individuals within the higher education community to believe the OCR will not enforce Title IX compliance as vigorously as it had under former President Barack Obama.UW-Madison will continue to uphold the standards of the Obama administration's Title IX guidelines, according to McGlone. She said recent efforts include adding the End Violence on Campus Coordinating Council, a Student Title IX Advisory Committee and additional prevention programs that were inspired by findings in the Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct.""UW-Madison works to ensure our process and policies are as equitable and effective as they can possibly be,"" McGlone said. ""Our approach to sexual violence is transparent, data-driven and constantly being improved as best practices in this area evolve ... Sexual violence not only does great harm to victimes—it has a negative effect on the entire campus community."" McGlone said they are continuing to make sexual assault a priority. She said Title IX will remain in federal law to protect students from gender-based discrimination, and the university is also subject to state laws, regulations on student misconduct policies and reporting of sexual assault statistics.In recent years, a network of student and community groups also have begun to address the issue of sexual violence at UW-Madison. In addition to resources like EVOC and Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment, there are also groups like loveusletters.com.Started by Black, loveusletters has become an online community where survivors of sexual violence can go to tell their stories and receive “support, community and compassion” from other survivors and allies.“I would say the campus is way more active and involved than the university,” said Erin Gray Daly, a UW-Madison student and sexual assault activist. “In the last four years I've seen students be more active in this and they're really been taking charge and a lot of that's in response to what the university's not doing.”Another group that could play a key role in ensuring that the university continues to comply with Title IX is the Associated Students of Madison’s Student Title IX Advisory Committee, a shared governance group that meets with Blom and other administrators to bring student feedback to university policies regarding Title IX and sexual violence investigations.While student activism around sexual violence will continue to be prominent, Gray Daly said this activism may be limited without access to institutional power structures like the OCR.“We can continue to be loud and active … but I just worry what's gonna happen without that access to those resources,” Gray Daly said.UPDATE March 15, 7:25 p.m.: This story was updated to include further information about UW-Madison's Title IX policies under the new administration from a UW-Madison spokesperson.","With 4 Title IX cases under investigation, groups try to improve handling of sexual violence on campus",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/faced-with-disproportionate-rates-of-assault-efforts-focus-on-greek-life-residence-halls,"March 15, 2017 | 7:24am CDT","Following a 2015 survey that revealed high rates of sexual assault at UW-Madison—particularly in residence halls and Greek houses—campus groups have been working to build prevention programs aimed at reducing these numbers.This programming aims to reach a significant portion of the campus population, as 90 percent of freshman choose to live in university housing and approximately 13 percent of undergraduates are members of the Greek community.University Health Services, UW Housing and Greek councils are working to combat sexual assault before it occurs through education and legislation.First-year students receive double dose of preventative measuresIn the fall of 2016, UHS held the first educational sessions they created for first-year students. The workshops were made in response to results from a national survey, which said the current program that teaches incoming students about sexual and dating violence—a 90-minute online course called Tonight—is useful, but not enough to end violence.Sam Johnson, a violence prevention specialist with UHS’ End Violence on Campus unit, said it was recommended they expand educational programming by utilizing a “multi-dose strategy.”“There are some diseases or illnesses that are so wide in scope you need your first vaccination to inoculate you, but, in some instances, you’re going to need a booster shot,” Johnson said. “This is the same idea that we draw from public health models, that sufficient dosage is important. You can’t just expect to solve a problem in a one-and-done program.”The Association of American Universities Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Sexual Misconduct suggest additional programming requires all first-year and transfer students under the age of roughly 25 to participate in in-person, peer-facilitated workshops within their first semester at UW-Madison. Students can choose from four programs in the GetWIse series: DatingWIse, SexWIse, ListenWIse and YouWIse.Participants have the option to complete the requirement in a large scale setting at Student Orientation, Advising and Registration. However, Johnson said most will attend sessions in groups of 15-20 students, many of which are held in residence halls.“The data on campus suggest that between 90 to 95 percent of first year students live in housing, so to us [hosting sessions in residence halls] made the most sense to [be] the most accessible to the largest number of students,” Johnson said.Assistant Director of Residence Life Amanda Thwing said the WIse workshops have given students a space to talk about and question personal topics.“Overall, I would say that the workshops that we host have been great at getting people to talk about a topic that is often uncomfortable,” Thwing said. “After both the Tonight online program and the in-person program, I believe, students are better prepared with information and resources around sexual assault, dating and domestic violence and stalking.”UHS offers another sexual assault prevention program for athletes and members of the Greek community called Green Dot. It is used by other schools and purchased by UHS, not created by them like WIse was. Johnson said Green Dot also differs from the WIse workshops in that it skips over definitions and is more skills-based.“We select Green Dot for Greek students and athletes because they are a built-in community with each other,” Johnson said. “We know those who have a shared sense of community and belonging and shared values, they may be in a stage that they’re more ready to learn those skills together.”Green Dot, like the WIse workshops, are conducted in-person and are based on audience participation. All new members of Greek life are required to complete it within their first year in a chapter. These are not always facilitated by a UHS staff member—anyone that becomes Green Dot certified after participating in a four-day training can lead sessions.Greek councils are encouraging senior members of the community to receive Green Dot certification in order to be peer mentors for new members, according to Dan Goldfield, the former chief justice of the interfraternity council and an original member of the Greek Life Task Force.Greek life works to prevent sexual violence through new community standardsAbout a year and a half ago, the Greek Life Task Force was formed after Chancellor Rebecca Blank challenged members of the Greek community to respond to the AAU survey.Members of the Greek executive board formed the risk management team, which branched into different groups, one of which focuses specifically on sexual and gender-based violence. Goldfield and other members of this group at this time began drafting bylaws to solidify the Greek community's stance on these issues, and provide a “how-to guide” for how to handle situations, according to Goldfield.“[The bylaws] address this issue on our campus, in our community. We are really trying to be proactive and give chapters resources and everything they need,” Goldfield said. “We have proactive measures, reactive measures, educational mechanisms, accountability mechanisms. It looks to address the problem from a very wide scope.”There are four sections of the bylaws, according President of the Interfraternity Council Michael Foy. The first two define sexual assault and provide legal terms for what is considered an offense. Foy said it also goes beyond legal definitions and explains “conduct that is unbecoming” of Greek members, meaning chapters can still be punished for behaviors that may not be considered illegal. The third portion discusses reporting and offers tools for doing so. The final section lists requirements for Greek members, including the Green Dot workshops.The bylaws will also require a safety and wellness chair within each chapter. This member will serve as a source of support for their Greek brothers or sisters; they will “break down the barriers of reporting,” according to Chief Justice of the Panhellenic Association Madeleine Haberman.Additionally, the bylaws serve as a guide for Greek chapters under investigation for those reasons mentioned. It instructs them how to be “forthcoming” and work with investigators.Haberman said the bylaws make it clear what the Greek community deems as unacceptable, not only regarding sexual and gender-based violence, but discussing discrimination and sexual harassment as well.The legislation specifies what behaviors are acceptable, including what language can be used in songs, and also mentions dating violence. This would allow the Greek governing board to issue punishments for occurrences not protected by the Student Organization Code of Conduct.UW-Madison’s chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity was reported earlier this year for reciting an explicit chant. Approximately 50 members of the chapter were heard chanting about a woman, saying “throw her against the wall,” followed by “line up 100 girls on the wall” and proceed to have sex with them. The committee that heard the case said it “encouraged sexual assault,” according to UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone.Sigma Chi was suspended earlier this year, but there was no mention of the chant in the university’s announcement.Goldfield said in instances such as this, they have gone one step further than university administration has with the bylaw changes.“We look at instances about free speech concerns which the university has some limitations on what they can do,” Goldfield said. “The bylaws specifically mention things like social songs and says these are not welcome in our community. We acknowledge that the university can’t step in all the time, but we're still going to.”The bylaws have been passed through the legal department at UW-Madison and the Division of Student Life, and have now been given to each of the four Greek governing councils. They have been passed by the Panhellenic Association and IFC, but the Multicultural Greek Council and National Pan-Hellenic Council are still in the process of deciding.Foy said the bylaws are the first step to ending sexual violence. He said he would love it if, after following through with the regulations, Greek houses—specifically fraternity houses—would be the safest places on campus.“This could be a situation where [sexual violence] goes to zero in our community, and we aren’t going to stop until it gets to that point,” Foy said. “Having these discussions, these measures in place … there’s no gray. There’s what we deem as acceptable, and what we deem as unacceptable. We'll hold ourselves to a higher standard.”UPDATE March 15, 1:41 p.m.: This article was updated to correctly label Madeleine Haberman as Chief Justice of the Panehellenic Association, not President.

Misconduct hearings at UW-Madison are tested against a preponderance of evidence standard, meaning the panel determines if it was more likely than not the student committed the reported violation. This is a much lower standard than what is used in criminal trials. Cook was previously placed under emergency suspension, meaning he was already barred from campus, because of “the severity of the allegations and the potential impact on the campus community,” according to Dean of Students Lori Berquam.The former UW-Madison student was originally arrested Oct. 17, 2016, and since then, nearly a dozen women have come forward to file reports against him.Van Wagner stressed that Cook was not given due process in the hearing, which was held Feb. 24 and resulted in a split decision. One of Van Wagner's major complaints was that he was not allowed to ask panelists about information they had prior to the hearing, as he said this would have shown potential biases.No additional details were provided by a university spokesperson about the hearing, as the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act only allows the university to release three details: student's name, violation and sanction.Van Wagner, who harshly criticized the university's announcement of the panel's vote, declined to provide the written decision for the hearing.

That is why we felt we were obligated to go to the judge for some relief, by blowing the whistle on this ‘legal foul.’”Nicholson agreed with her colleague.“I’d like to have the opportunity to do my job and defend my client,” Nicholson told the Cardinal. “That requires having the materials we are constitutionally entitled to.”Van Wagner and Nicholson have informally requested the documents be released by the state at least 10 separate times through emails, phone calls and “in-person chats.”“They reneged on an informal agreement we made with them by which they would have the first 2,800 pages of reports and documents to us last week,” Van Wagner said. “By filing the motion, we forced the prosecutors to do something in response. And we invoked the power of the judge to supervise and facilitate production of the reports. Without his involvement, the state would have been able to continue to drag its feet if it chose to do so.”Johnny Koremenos, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Department of Justice, said the sensitive nature of the documents accounts for the delay.“DOJ is still in the process of redacting the discovery to ensure protection of the privacy rights of the victims,” Koremenos said. “It is taking longer than initially anticipated.”Cook, from Edina, Minn., faces 21 charges involving 10 women. The charges include strangulation, sexual assault, stalking and false imprisonment. Fifteen of the counts are felonies.The documents, ordered to release by Thursday at 4 p.m., will not be made public.",Alec Cook’s attorneys land thousands of pages of previously unseen evidence,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/hundreds-rally-at-the-capitol-for-international-womens-day,"March 8, 2017 | 4:55pm CST","At least 600 people rallied at the state Capitol Wednesday to observe International Women’s Day, participating in a day of strikes, protests, lobbying and walkouts that event organizers titled “A Day Without a Woman.” The civic action in Madison was part of a nationwide movement designed to show the contributions women make to the economy and call attention to the injustices women endure around the world.People of all ages, including a sizeable number of students who walked out of area high schools around midday, showed their support by marching from different parts of the city to the Capitol, where speakers bemoaned not just threats to women’s rights, but also to the rights of immigrants, refugees, LGBTQ people and people of color.A group of about 50 UW-Madison students met on Library Mall to hear a speaker from the university’s socialist organization at 11 a.m., after some walked out of classes to join the protest. As they marched down State Street to join the citywide rally, they shouted chants that celebrated the intersections of social justice movements.“Gay, straight, black, white; same struggle, same fight!” a member of the International Socialist Organization’s Madison chapter shouted through a megaphone, as the marchers drew the attention of unsuspecting passersby.As the UW-Madison students arrived at the Capitol, about 25 minutes before the event was scheduled to officially start at noon, a modest group of community members lingered around downtown Madison. But about 15 minutes later, a large swarm of high school students, along with some teachers, flooded the Capitol after staging a walkout from a number of area schools.The students, who came by the hundreds, chanted, “this is what a feminist looks like” and “women united will never be defeated” as they made their way up the steps of the Capitol.“I have the privilege to be able to skip out on school and work, and this is about speaking out for people who don’t have that chance,” Rose Caplan, a Madison East High School student who attended the rally, said. “Some people don’t have as much security as me, like undocumented immigrants. Me coming here is me trying to give them a voice and stand up for their rights that they might not have the chance to talk about.”Other students cited the wage gap, high rates of sexual assault and general discrimination as reasons they felt it was important to attend the protest.“I think it’s backwards that a victim [of sexual assault] should be blamed for what happened to her or him,” Zoe Svanoe, a La Follette High School student, said.Jagoda Swallop, also from La Follette, added that the rally was not just about women, but all marginalized people.“I never had the chance to go to a protest, but it’s an extremely important issue,” Swallop said. “People have to deal with discrimination all over—not just women, but people of color and many others.”Speakers at the event continued the rally’s theme of intersectionality.Jessica Williams, an advocate for survivors of gender-based violence at Freedom Inc., pointed to the story of Cierra Finkley as an example of a minority woman being failed by a system that is insensitive to women’s issues. Williams said Finkley was a victim of domestic abuse, and was punished for acting out in self-defense after several disregarded 911 calls.“If you are a black woman, you don’t get mentioned when women are discussed,“ Williams said. “Patriarchy is not just personal or private, but also structural.”There were political undertones to the rally, with many of the speakers denouncing the Trump administration for what they considered misogyny and insensitivity to women’s and minority issues.“I don’t think a march like this has happened before that I can recall on International Women’s Day. Maybe I’m more aware this year because of the new administration,” Barb Klich, a nurse in Madison, said. “I’m here today for reproductive rights, Planned Parenthood and the ACA.”Some protesters entered the Capitol after the rally to voice support to their representatives for women’s issues. The day of action continued later Wednesday evening with an event titled “International Women's Day Against Trump,” held at UW-Madison's humanities building.UPDATE March 8, 9:15 p.m.: This article was updated to include information about an event Wednesday night.",Hundreds rally at the Capitol for International Women’s Day,UWM

It details 10 “recommendations” for university actions to better the treatment of students of color on campus.Patrick Sims, the university’s vice provost and chief diversity officer, and Leslie Orrantia, director of community relations, sent a letter to the group last week, thanking them for their “genuine investment in the critically important work of making UW-Madison a more inclusive place.”Sims and Orrantia told the group they will work with them on diversity issues in the future by “engag[ing] in a collaborative meeting process.”“We envision working alongside you to discuss our efforts in greater depth, talking about our progress, listening to your insights, and providing opportunities for you to inform continued improvement, including the creation of new initiatives where gaps may exist,” Sims and Orrantia said in the letter.The Collective’s original letter, signed by over 160 black alumni, called on UW-Madison to “intentionally include diversity and inclusion throughout the student experience,” “require diversity and inclusion components throughout employee hiring, onboarding, and evaluation processes” and “create a robust response and support protocol to hate and bias incidents that is at least as sophisticated and interdepartmental as the campus sexual assault response protocol,” among other recommendations.The letter also criticized UW-Madison’s response to an incident in October in which a spectator at a Wisconsin football game was photographed in a costume depicting former President Barack Obama wearing a noose. The university initially defended the spectator’s right to free speech.In response to the group’s recommendation that the university “improve communication about diversity, inclusion, and climate progress, programs and initiatives,” Sims and Orrantia acknowledged that the school’s “communications to date about those initiatives haven’t been great,” and invited the Collective to a quarterly phone call to discuss possible solutions.“We’ll begin our first call by listening to your recommendations, hearing your concerns, and sharing a detailed overview of the initiatives that fit within your recommendations,” Sims and Orrantia wrote. “[This will] put us on the same page and ensure our work is most effective.”",UW-Madison administration aims to work with black alumni group on improving campus climate,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/breaking-down-uw-madisons-sexual-assault-numbers,"March 8, 2017 | 8:49am CST","Data from a university official recently revealed reports of sexual assault increased by more than 100 in 2016 at UW-Madison, but the report included additional information about the nature of the reports as well.A lack of informationTo a large extent, the numbers are clouded by uncertainty: Of the 325 reported cases, 215—roughly two-thirds—were reported to confidential sources, who don’t disclose details of the assault. That statistical shortage limited the revelations the data could provide.More than 77 percent of the assaults occurred at an unknown location, and in 170 of the reports, or 52 percent of them, it was unknown whether the victim and assailant were acquaintances. The respondent was identified as a UW-Madison student in just 21 of the reported cases. Additionally, the degree of sexual assault was unknown in three-fourths of cases.Report detailsDespite these blind spots, the data still contained some striking discoveries. Half of the reports, 36 of them, with known locations occurred on campus; of those, 15 occurred in residence halls. In 31 percent of the reports, there was known alcohol and/or drug use.The data also analyzed whether the victim and assailant knew each other; in 38 percent of cases the victim and assailant did know each other, and in 10 percent they did not. When they were acquaintances, the percentage of higher-degree sexual assaults was greater: For victims and assailants who knew each other, 27 percent of reports involved first, second or third degree assaults; for those who did not, just 16 percent of cases involved these degrees of assault. In either case, alcohol and/or drug involvement was high: 44 percent for acquaintances, and 48 percent for non-acquaintances.The reports resulted in 15 investigations, one expulsion and three suspensions; five cases are still in progress. Culpability for sexual assault also sometimes included educational sanctions, such as mandatory alcohol education or restrictions on extracurricular activity participation.None of the incidents were discovered to be unfounded after law enforcement investigations.Comparison to past reportsThe 325 reported sexual assaults represented a roughly 50 percent increase from 2015, and a 166 percent increase from 2013. Still, the data alone can’t give a definitive answer for the root cause of these increases: Are they attributable to more sexual assaults, or better reporting?According to Tonya Schmidt, assistant dean and director in the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, university efforts to improve access to reporting deserve at least some of the credit. Schmidt said actions such as hiring a full-time Title IX coordinator and requiring additional sexual assault education for students have made a difference.“UW-Madison has made a concerted effort over the past several years to break down barriers to reporting and encourage more students to come forward and seek assistance,” Schmidt said. “We believe the increase in reports is a sign that prevention, education, and outreach efforts are working.”",Breaking down UW-Madison’s sexual assault numbers,UWM

This more than doubles the increase between 2014 and 2015, when the number of reports rose by only 45.Tonya Schmidt, assistant dean and director in the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, said the office has consistently seen an uptick of reports after they were able to publicize resources and clearly communicate their process with a Violence Against Women grant from the Department of Justice in 2009.Following this, Schmidt said she believes many students felt more comfortable coming forward once they knew what resources existed, rights afforded to them and how the reporting process works. This includes knowing that a student won’t get in trouble for underage drinking if they report a sexual assault.More than two-thirds of the 2016 reports—215 instances—were disclosed to confidential resources and no further information was given to be followed up on for an investigation. This means that officials do not have information about what degree of assault and where these occurred, or if they were perpetrated by a student.Of the ones that did contain additional information, 15 proceeded with an investigation.Out of the 15 investigations, four were found not responsible and six responsible.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/nearly-half-of-uw-madison-fraternities-faced-punishment-in-2016-documents-show,"March 1, 2017 | 8:00am CST","A young man, face bright red, covered in vomit and urine, lay slumped in the corner of a basement while a frat party continued.Several members of Sigma Phi Epsilon’s UW-Madison chapter carried the severely incapacitated person into a bathroom, one saying, “F--- you … you always do this.”He remained in the bathroom until the party ended, and was then dropped off a block away from the fraternity’s house so emergency services could finally be called without the chapter being implicated.This case, first reported in November 2015, is not isolated. More than a dozen fraternities on campus faced university punishment in 2016 because of alcohol violations.An investigation by The Daily Cardinal found that 13 fraternities at UW-Madison—just under half of those on campus—were on probation or suspension in 2016.Each fraternity on probation or suspension had at least one alcohol-related offense, according to a series of documents obtained through an open records request by the Cardinal.President of UW-Madison’s Interfraternity Council and UW-Madison student Michael Foy said alcohol use is “absolutely” an issue within Greek life, going as far as to call it an “epidemic” throughout campus.UW-Madison’s Director of the Center for Leadership & Involvement Eric Knueve largely agreed.“On campus, illegal, unsafe alcohol is a problem that has been going on for a long time,” Knueve said. “It’s hard to say if it is any worse this year.”A student at the Sigma Phi Epsilon party described above helped file the report against the fraternity, which led to some of the heaviest punishments levelled against a Greek organization on campus in recent years.The fraternity—already on probation for a prior alcohol violation—displayed “egregious negligence” for the safety of a severely intoxicated guest, as detailed earlier, according to a report from the Committee on Student Organizations.The CSO placed Sigma Phi Epsilon on suspension for more than a year, with a probation that would extend the punishment by roughly an additional year. A factor in these sanctions was the organization’s history of transgressions; in the last three years, they were already placed under suspension, faced probation several times and were involved in at least eight different reported cases.Another alcohol violation less than a year later resulted in Sigma Phi Epsilon’s termination on Oct. 4, 2016.Foy said this incident marked a “complete failure” of all safeguards that were in place, from the IFC to the fraternity's national level.“That is the exception, not the rule. The trend with the 13 fraternities, that may get a little bit closer,” Foy said. “I hope that the Sigma Phi Epsilon incident isn’t seen as the norm.”Documents gathered by The Daily Cardinal include reports from the 2015-’16 academic year and the Fall 2016 Semester for all fraternities and sororities at UW-Madison. Knueve said roughly 50 reports are received a year.Thirteen out of 29 fraternities on UW-Madison’s campus in 2016 were on probation for some portion of that year; two fraternities were on suspension during 2016 and Sigma Phi Epsilon’s status as a Registered Student Organization was terminated, according to the documents.There were many reports of unsafe alcohol use, ranging from underage students being served hard liquor to parties with oversize crowds. In some cases there were simply not enough designated sober people monitoring the party, while in others, students were sent to detox after being overserved at a fraternity event.UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone said the CSO, which hears the reports against student organizations, has a “menu of potential sanctions” that can be imposed on these groups. She said probation is the most common early sanction as the penalty aims to deter future, more serious offenses.Knueve said a fraternity on probation can continue to operate normally, but if any additional violations were to occur during this period, then it would be taken into consideration for stricter sanctions.Only four of 15 sororities at UW-Madison were on probation for some time during 2016, with no suspensions. Three of the probations were the result of violations stemming from unsafe or illegal alcohol use.Another probation was the result of hazing, as a sorority made freshmen members sing a song that reportedly condoned sexual assault. The CSO determined that the lyrics—which included lines like “they roll me over and lift up my dress, now that I’m an A E PHI (sic) I always will say yes”—could be considered “humiliating or degrading to those expected to participate.”In a case decided on the first day of classes this semester, Sigma Chi was found to have recited a similar chant, with lyrics more explicitly detailing violence. There was “no dispute” that the chant occurred in this case, and the CSO said it “encouraged sexual assault,” but the fraternity was not found responsible for conduct violations due to the chant. They were, however, suspended for alcohol violations.Foy said he thinks the CSO typically assigns just punishments—which they did in the Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority case—but he went on to say that he believes Sigma Chi should have been found in violation for their chant condoning sexual assault.“It’s a bit unfortunate that [Sigma Chi was] not sort of punished more for this incident,” Foy said. “I can only imagine what was going through [the CSO’s] minds when they were making their decision.”Also included in UW-Madison’s Greek life are 10 chapters in the Multicultural Greek Council, none of which were involved in any reports in the documents. Additionally, zero of the five Black Greek Letter Organizations on campus were on probation in 2016.The drinking culture on Langdon Street, which houses many campus fraternities, can also reach students not involved with Greek life. A recent survey found that 40 percent of students of color at UW-Madison avoid specific areas of campus due to drinking culture. Of the students who said they avoided specific areas, 52.7 percent said they avoided Langdon Street.Many UW-Madison fraternities still remain on probation or suspension. Beta Theta Pi, Delta Upsilon, Kappa Sigma, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi still face these additional restrictions, though many are set to be lifted at the end of the semester.Three fraternities—Sigma Phi Epsilon, Chi Phi and Alpha Epsilon Pi—have been terminated since the Spring 2015 Semester. Each case involved an alcohol-related violation. Prior to 2015, the most recent termination occurred in 2006.An analysis of the documents showed all fraternities on probation were found responsible for alcohol-related violations, but the initial reports against each group varied and were often not focused on alcohol.Different fraternities have been investigated for sexual assaults, drugging women, extensive destruction of property and discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender or race.In most cases, the CSO did not find enough evidence that the fraternities in question were more likely responsible than not for the initially reported transgression.In March 2016, Sigma Pi was reported for a possible violation. The description of the incident was succinct: “I was sexually assaulted by a member of sigma pi (sic).”The CSO found that a member of Sigma Pi assaulted a guest at the fraternity’s residence at 420 N. Carroll St. during one of the chapter’s event.The punishment was a single semester on general probation, with a requirement that 75 percent of the chapter’s membership attend a sexual assault prevention workshop.Foy said he thinks that chapter’s punishment was largely fair, and the fault lies mostly on the individual, though he does not think the education requirement went far enough.“I am not a fan of the percentage of members, or even new members, type of education,” Foy said in reference to the 75 percent requirement. “It definitely should be an all-or-nothing thing.”Sigma Pi was only found responsible for two out of five Student Organization Code of Conduct violations they faced following this incident. One was an alcohol violation, as they failed to check for valid IDs. The second violation dealt with the sexual assailant, who acted as an individual but was still a representative of the fraternity.Sigma Pi’s probation was lifted Dec. 31, 2016.McGlone said ""a significant reason the chapter was found not to be in violation for the charges related to the sexual assault"" was due to the actions of the fraternity when the victim reported the incident to the chapter. Sigma Pi put the reported assailant on immediate suspension from the fraternity. McGlone went on to say that there was also an additional student misconduct investigation into the sexual assault, which resulted in the reported assailant being found responsible and suspended from the university.UW-Madison’s chapter of Sigma Pi did not respond to request for comment.Foy said UW-Madison’s Greek community is acknowledging many of its problems and is now working toward fixing them.“The Greek community is ready to be more transparent,” Foy said. “The more this can get brought to light and what our chapters are doing about it particularly, I think the better, because there are pitfalls of Greek life.”","Nearly half of UW-Madison fraternities faced punishment in 2016, documents show",UWM

Little did she know that her work would spur the national campaign “It’s on Us.”The student government at UW-River Falls held a conference last weekend that hosted Rosenthal, the first national advisor on Violence Against Women, as the keynote speaker. She spoke to Wisconsin and Minnesota students interested in learning how they can do more to prevent sexual assault and dating violence on their campuses.“Those other leaders have diverse roles and expertise. Going to the summit is the only way to tap into their efforts and share ours,” said Colin Barushok, chair of the Student Service Finance Committee.Barushok was one of nearly 20 UW-Madison students who made the trek to River Falls, some affiliated with the Associated Students of Madison and some who decided to join after an email sparked their attention.“I met Ellie Shelp, a UW-Madison freshman,” said Matt Wulf, ASM Outreach Director. “She is not directly involved with any orgs on campus addressing the issue, but she felt compelled to attend the summit because of how passionate she is about the issue. I am excited to see how she, and all of us, make an effort to address sexual violence on campus.”Besides making connections with other student and national leaders, participants engaged in workshops of their choosing ranging from learning about legal recourses for survivors to how to connect with local nonprofits.“Sexual assault and dating violence constitute one of the most important issues we face on campus,” said Jason Klein, ASM Press Office Director.Klein said he plans to dive into research on UW-Madison’s campus. One suggestion he said he took to heart was to look into what recommendations have already been made and what progress has been made.The presenters noted the importance of daily acts, and re-teaching everyone different social cues in order to progress as a society.Rosenthal said, “It's about the daily acts, not the heroic acts.”",It’s On Us brings campuses together to combat sexual assault,UWM

Members of UW-Madison organizations collaborated on event ideas and gave advice to newcomers about ideas for educational programs during the month.“One of the big functions of our office is to empower other people to kind of do their own version of prevention work and part of that is the collaboration and creating Sexual Assault Awareness Month events or sharing the events,” UHS Violence Prevention Specialist Alex Nelson said. “Really, we want to lead by example in normalizing and teaching folks how to create these kinds of meetings.”The group, We’re Better Than That-Men Against Sexual Assault will host an event at Chaser’s Bar & Grille March 16 from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. An art display called “Common.Diverse” will be featured in the Red Gym in April displaying artwork from sexual assault survivors.A representative from the Rape Crisis Center offered assistance to organizations who may need help if survivors become triggered during events.“The goal of tonight was to get different student [organizations] on campus together as well as representatives from the Rape Crisis Center and from UHS services, just get everyone to kind of create a space to share what people have been thinking about in terms of sexual assault awareness month events,” Nelson said.Many of the organizations will be hosting several sexual assault events in March and April following this collaborative meeting.“We can’t end sexual assault unless we all work together and share other experiences and ideas, and really work together on initiatives,” Nelson said.",Student organizations plan Sexual Assault Awareness Month events,UWM

Jill Billings, D-La Crosse, was one of the legislators who expressed interest in supporting the initiative.Billings, who has two children in college and is close with her campus in La Crosse, said she had considered this topic prior to her meeting with UW Student Representatives. She added that students asking for this initiative is a good indicator it would be received favorably.UW-Madison has had violence prevention staff since 1998. According to Carmen Juniper Neimeko, a manager for the Violence Prevention and Victim Advocacy program through University Health Services, the staff mostly work to develop programs for prevention and student engagement and education. It was not until 2014 they had a direct role in survivor support.“Having good infrastructure for your campus and specifically dedicated and trained professional staff does tend to both show commitment and have an impact on how survivors feel supported and how student have the tools to prevent the violence,” said Juniper Neimeko.She said that through the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault they have been able to network with staff who work in a similar capacity across the state, some schools like UW-La Crosse and UW-Madison have a paid position on campus and others support a non-profit that fulfills that role.Billing’s office is currently beginning a “research phase,” examining how other campuses use this position and what legislation other states have. While she acknowledged that universities want to highlight the positive aspects of their schools, she said violence happens on campuses and she wants to help.“I understand that, but this isn’t an issue that should be swept under the rug,” Billings said. “It should be addressed and if someone is in that situation, there should be someone there to help them and walk them through what's next; being respectful to the person who has suffered from assault and being an advocate.”",Students lobby for Violence Prevention Specialist in state-law,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/02/student-groups-university-work-to-ease-culture-shock-for-native-students,"February 20, 2017 | 6:25am CST","Balancing the newfound energy of city life with academics proved challenging for Emily Nelis, a student who came to UW-Madison after growing up on an Indian reservation in northern Wisconsin.Now a leader in the Native American community on campus, finding a community of other native students helped combat the initial culture shock.Her experiences are not unique; many native students struggle when adjusting to life on the UW-Madison campus. The Native American student organization Wunk Sheek, of which she is now co-president, helped her find a family on campus.“Wunk Sheek was and still is my little hub to be who I am without sacrificing anything ... I could talk about something from the res, I could talk about powwows, I could talk about ceremonies,” Nelis said. “Wunk Sheek was and is my biggest support system on this campus.”Recently, in an effort to make UW-Madison a welcoming place for students like Nelis, Associated Students of Madison passed legislation requiring council meetings to begin with a recognition that the university sits on indigenous land.According to ASM Equity & Inclusion Committee Chair Ali Khan, a non-native student suggested the legislation to ASM. Khan then used his connections with Wunk Sheek to bring the voices of native students into the conversation.“I suddenly felt a little uncomfortable, because I felt like we were speaking on behalf of native issues when we didn’t really have that perspective in the room when creating the legislation,” Khan said.According to Khan, bringing in this perspective made the legislation stronger and more effective.Wunk Sheek helped ASM amend it to call on the university to recognize Columbus Day as Indigenous People’s Day, and install a plaque on the Bascom Hill statue of Abraham Lincoln, recognizing his role in the systematic oppression of native people.“We realized that there was a lot more [to do] than just recognizing Indigenous People’s Day to better the lives of Native American students on this campus,” Khan said.While groups like Wunk Sheek and ASM work to elevate the voices of native students, UW-Madison should do more to support the Native community, according to Khan.The American Indian Studies department is not properly funded, Khan added. He also worries that Wunk Sheek will lose funding if allocable segregated fees become optional.Recently, UW-Madison has worked to reach out to native populations. Nichole Boyd, the American Indian Campus and Community Liaison, said her office offers potential native students specific tours showcasing the resources available to the native community.Despite the Ho-Chunk Nation holding treaty rights to UW-Madison’s campus, the university struggles with recruitment and retention of native students.“As native students, we tend to have the lowest retention rates and the lowest graduation rates in college, and I think that for an institution like UW that has the Wisconsin Idea ... it’s important for them to do better for their indigenous students,” Nelis said.As an attempt to address these problems in the native community, UW-Madison administration started the Native Nations Working Group last summer. Made up of about 30 faculty and staff, the group aims to better meet the needs of native students on campus in a culturally responsive manner.“The most important thing is we went to the tribes we didn’t ask them to come to us, we went to them and asked to meet. It’s really important again from an indigenous point of view to go to that community and be on their land,” Boyd stated.Sexual assault is another challenge for the native community; while Native American students make up just under 1 percent of the student body at UW-Madison, 47 percent of the native women at UW-Madison report being sexually assaulted, according to Boyd.“My office works directly with University Health Services and EVOC to make sure that those students are getting counseling and support services and making sure that it’s done in a culturally responsive way,” Boyd said. “There are ceremonies within our communities to make sure that those women heal properly, so [there is] access to that if a student would want to participate in something culturally.”For Khan and Nelis, how often native women at UW-Madison are assaulted is just another example of the university not doing enough to support the Native American community.“To hear that number was just mind blowing, well first of all it’s just super embarrassing, and disgracefuI, I just feel like the university isn’t doing enough for the Native American student population on this campus,” Khan said.According to Nelis, Native Americans make up such a small portion of the student body that their voices are often left out of important campus discussions.“There is a bigger need for reaching out to tribal communities not only on reservations but also in urban areas like Milwaukee or Chicago, or other cities with really large native populations, just to make it known that there are resources here on our campus,” Nelis said.Nelis expressed her concerns that campus resources are not visible enough.“I think that there definitely is a bigger need to just kind of get those resources out to native students in high school still so that they know that UW can be a place for them to feel comfortable,” Nelis said.","Student groups, university work to ease ‘culture shock’ for native students",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/02/cardinal-view-good-samaritan-laws-should-go-further,"February 13, 2017 | 6:00am CST","Passed out on a stranger’s bathroom floor. Stumbling down the street, held up by friends. Leaning over a plastic Walgreens bag in an Uber. Images most college students have witnessed—or personally experienced—during a night out.There’s a fine line in these situations when one too many shots flirts with alcohol poisoning, when one more pill tiptoes on overdose. But how do we as college students make that judgment call for ourselves or for a friend? With unclear policies regarding underage drinking or drug use and potential punishments across different police departments, it’s difficult to know what the consequences of calling 911 will be—for both the caller and the person in trouble.In a perfect world, emergency services would be contacted regardless of the repercussions for the sake of safety. But with underage drinking tickets costing as much as $263.50 for a first time offense and detox treatments totaling $530, the monetary effects can be troubling enough, let alone further legal ramifications.A partnership between the UW-Madison Police Department and university took steps in the right direction to clarify this about six years ago through the Responsible Action Guidelines, which aim to “create a situation where responsible action is encouraged and expected,” according to the website.The guidelines detail the situations in which the caller—not the person in danger themselves—would not be penalized for contacting emergency services despite consumption of alcohol. They do not apply to supplying of alcohol, use or possession of other drugs illegally or other crimes.The procedure focuses around four situations: victims of crime, a person in need of medical attention, a caller who stays with the impaired individuals and for representatives of organizations hosting events who contact authorities.“We’re reasonable people, and if you’re a victim of a crime or you do the right thing and you call for help for somebody, we’re not going to cite you,” UWPD Director of Communications Marc Lovicott said. “If you work with us and cooperate with us, we appreciate these individuals doing the right thing.”While the guidelines take some of the pressure off of someone getting aid for a friend, this set of exceptions is solely for callers interacting with UWPD, whose jurisdiction is limited to campus, such as in residence halls, campus streets, sport venues, etc. These guidelines are very important and could save lives, yet they are not in place at the Madison Police Department.When someone passes out at a bar or overdoses at a house party off campus, MPD officers will be the ones responding to the scene. MPD Chief Mike Koval said the focus of any emergency situation is providing help to the person in trouble.“I believe that our Department is more interested in rendering aid than assigning blame or culpability,” Koval said in an email. “When someone calls in a heroin overdose, our first and foremost concern as ‘guardians’ is to ensure that we can save a life.”A bystander should never hesitate to call for help in an emergency situation for the fear of a drinking ticket for themselves or the endangered individual. Given the vulnerability of someone “under the throes of alcohol,” the chances of being the victim of a violent crime, sexual assault or life threatening maladie will increase, according to Koval.“We should always place a premium on encouraging the reporting of these various activities as opposed to ‘punishing’ those who took the time and made the effort to bring a situation to our attention,” Koval said.The ultimate goal of both police departments is commendable, to first provide care to the endangered and focus on potential charges or misdemeanors after. However, the Responsible Action Guidelines are just that–guidelines, not a formal code. While Koval’s stance at MPD follows a similar process, there’s no written record of it.“I agree with the city stance too,” Lovicott said of MPD. “They may not have a guideline, but in our working relationship with the city, you know they’re reasonable, and they’re not going to pursue a citation against an individual, in general terms, when they call to try to get help for a friend.”The inconsistency in policies between departments is understandable, however, it leaves students confused and uninformed, wondering if UWPD’s guidelines or the discretion of an MPD officer will determine the caller’s consequences for something such as underage drinking.Our editorial board acknowledges the work put forth by the university and UWPD’s partnership and MPD’s commitment to safety. However, we seek a more progressive angle of a Good Samaritan law to fully and consistently protect not only the caller but the endangered person in an emergency situation involving alcohol and drugs. Surely the effects of a near-death experience are a more prominent consequence than paying a fine.For Skye Tikkanen, who helped chair an ad hoc committee within the  State Council on Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse, finding ways to get those who overdose to call 911 is vital to combating overdose deaths.A 2013 report spearheaded by Tikkanen and representatives from the state Department of Justice, law enforcement officials and others helped lead the way to a bill in 2013 that protects individuals from civil and criminal liability for calling 911 to help a friend, even if they are in possession of a controlled substance.Assembly Bill 447 was part of the Heroin, Opiate Prevention and Education Agenda, a collection of bills that state Rep. John Nygren, R-Marinette, helped get through the legislature.However, Wisconsin’s 911 Good Samaritan laws could go further, Tikkanen said, and our editorial board agrees.Other states such as Maryland, where Tikkanen lived before Wisconsin, protect the person who does overdose from criminal liability for drug possession. According to Tikkanen, legislators like Nygren, as well as parents, were initially against these protections because they were concerned that if someone who overdoses doesn’t get arrested, that person wouldn’t get the treatment they need.At the time the expanded proposal was introduced, UWPD was against it as well.“We were not supportive of that [legislation] because the legislation took one step further, ensuring the individual who was in trouble, the person who maybe had too much to drink, also wouldn’t be sanctioned or have any repercussions against them,” Lovicott said. “We need people to understand that they can’t do this, and get no repercussions from it.”However, Nygren and Tikkanen have been working on ways to get those who overdose the treatment that they need without having to go through an arrest.“We know that treatment works better than jail,” Tikkanen said. “Recidivism is very high if we incarcerate them, many go back to using, and in a lot of cases, that’s not an effective strategy.”Whether in a bar or a residence hall, students should never hesitate when someone is in danger for the fear of an underage drinking ticket. In a state known for its binge drinking and on a campus notorious for being the number one party school, some students will toe the line of overdrinking or overdosing.It is encouraging that legislators from both sides of the aisle are working on ways to expand treatment options for those who overdose, as treatment is a better avenue than an arrest and potential jail time.We need to support policy and legislation that will save lives. Passing up this opportunity has detrimental, and sometimes fatal, costs.What are your thoughts on the existing Good Samaritan policies on campus and in the city of Madison?

We will be by your side every step of the way.”WCASA Executive Director Pennie Meyers touted the program as a win for survivors of sexual violence.“It is important to remember that behind each kit is a sexual assault survivor,” Meyers said. “Thus, we have approached this daunting task in a trauma-informed and victim-centered manner from the very beginning.”Wisconsin was widely criticized after the revelation over a year ago that thousands of its rape kits had never been tested. The state’s Department of Justice received $4 million of federal grant money in 2015 to accelerate testing, but Schimel’s office did not specify whether the grants will be used to fund “By Your Side.”The attorney general said his office is working to eliminate the testing backlog, and that the new initiative will make it easier for sexual assault survivors to track the process.Schimel campaigned on a platform of helping sexual assault survivors in 2014, and was awarded the Wisconsin Association of Victim and Witness Professionals “Wisconsin Professional of the Year” in 2006 for his work on survivors’ behalves.",Attorney general rolls out sexual assault kit tracking initiative,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/01/new-uwpd-chief-hopes-to-repair-connection-between-police-campus-community,"January 25, 2017 | 9:07am CST","Before being sworn in as the newest leader of the UW-Madison Police Department, Chief Kristen Roman sat down with The Daily Cardinal to discuss the most prevalent issues on campus, including campus carry legislation, undocumented students and sexual assault, among other issues.Roman served as captain of community outreach at the Madison Police Department for 26 years. There, she led efforts to provide police services to individuals with mental illnesses in the Madison community.Roman said she competed for the position with the intent of bringing her knowledge of community issues and leadership abilities to campus, and is excited to pursue new projects.She plans to bring her leadership and communication skills to the UW-Madison campus and use it to strengthen the relationship between her department and individuals on campus and throughout the city.What goals do you have for the future as UWPD chief and plans do you have?Some of the things I’m looking at [are] that in my career, really within the last three years or so primarily, we all know we’ve seen a real challenge when it comes to police and community relationships and issues of trust. What that has done for me is, certainly, prompted me to do some reflection of the role of police and what the community’s expectations are for police. It’s also been very disheartening to have experienced that breach in trust that the community has with police. Really, it doesn’t matter what department you’re in at that point—people see a uniform and sort of have their reactions to police as a profession. So I really want to focus on having those community conversations around the relationship that the community has with police and, of course, my focus will be the campus community and this police department and what role we play in supporting and furthering the mission of the UW and supporting students and faculty in the day-to-day work that we’re doing. I think that there’s a bit of shift with the profession as a whole. I think we’re at a turning point, and a necessary one, to do some self-reflection. Not do that in a vacuum, but do that through discourse and conversation with the community about what their expectations are and what do they expect of police, what do they want from police, and to listen to and hear those conversations, how those unfold, and, hopefully, move forward around what I think have been some obstacles that are certainly in place through an erosion of trust. It has not been my experience or anything that I have heard directly, that the UWPD has any sort of disconnect or falling out with the campus community; in fact I hear the opposite. I hear that people’s interactions with UW police have been overwhelmingly positive, so I just want to build on some of those things. But I do know that there has been some unrest in the city and certainly on campus with respect to police and that’s an area I want to focus on.Other areas I want to focus on are building on and bringing in some of my experience around mental health. That’s kind of taking a look at how we engage with the campus community around supporting and identifying mental health crises or challenges. I know college is a very stressful time for young adults and it’s also a time where mental illness can begin to manifest for the first time. There’s also just the stressors that are there for some students that potentially increase their likelihood of suicide or thoughts of suicide. These are all areas that I think police can really make a difference in collaborating and supporting individuals. That’s certainly something I want to look at and explore what services we provide and how we can bolster any of those in the community.Other issues are, of course, alcohol and sexual assault. I’ve seen a lot of, from watching over at MPD, all the great work that this department has done in educating and in partnering around prevention for sexual assault. I want to keep moving that work forward and building on that. I like the “Don’t Be That Guy” campaign that really focuses in on the role and responsibility of perpetrators or potential perpetrators to be thinking about these issues. “Stop the violence” kinds of campaigns I think are fantastic and I want to keep those moving forward. I know that sexual assault on campuses across the country is an issue and they’re grossly underreported. One of the things I’d like to focus on is how we, as a public safety entity, encourage and support victims to come forward and report. What that looks like right now, only a week in, I’m not exactly sure, I’ll have to take a look at that, but those are some of the key issues I’m working on—community partnership-building, collaboration and trust; sexual assault; mental health and the nexus, of course, with alcohol is I think there on all fronts, so I’ll also be looking at that.You actually just touched on my last question a bit, which is that of sexual assault. Last semester we saw two pretty high profile cases on campus. How would you go about responding to cases such as those that have received national attention?Responding, in two ways, once we are reacting to, or responding to, a sexual assault or a series of sexual assaults that have occurred initially our primary role is that investigation and how we work with, in a couple of cases here we’re not just talking about campus assaults but assaults that involve students off campus, and so partnering and coordinating with MPD or other agencies is certainly key. So, really just making sure that we are prepared to provide that investigatory support. Working with the university, however, we are able then for the work that they’re doing in response, because we each have a role when it comes to sexual assaults, so there’s that, but there’s also, as I mentioned before, how do we advocate for and support victims and take care of them? If they’ve come forward and are courageous enough to be reporting to our department then really we have an opportunity there to assure that they are connected to the various services and support systems that are in place, both on campus and in the city, through the criminal investigation. If it gets to criminal court, there’s that whole side of things that we would also be supporting the victim through. That’s just really about having the sensitivity, and a competency and understanding on all fronts as we move through those particular cases or those investigations. So there’s the specific response to the cases and then, of course, there’s the larger campus conversation about just the issue of sexual assault and I think we are plugged in and I want to stay plugged in on both of those fronts.Another thing we saw on campus was a lot more protests last semester. Especially with a new administration what kind of plans do you have set up to control campus and keep it safe during times of political turmoil such as these?Only a week in I’ve already begun to meet with student associations, like the chair of the Associated Students of Madison and have planned on my calendar to attend one of their monthly meetings coming up in February. Some of it just has to do with pre-planning and meeting ahead of time to lay some, I guess, agreed-upon-ground rules about how we want to facilitate people’s right to protest and assemble and speak what’s on their mind. That is a lot of work that can be done in advance to reach some sort of a mutual understanding about what the expectations are. I, of course, want people to exercise their rights to speak out, but my role is to ensure that they’re doing that and that we’re facilitating that in a way that keeps everyone safe and doesn’t break any laws, essentially. That’s clearly what our primary role is in that. The way to do that is to engage ahead of time with organizers and student activists and to let them know we’re not there to impede. We’re there to facilitate and talk to them about how we can best accomplish that together. Sometimes there are people whose goal potentially is to disrupt and so I want to have that conversation, too. If that is your ultimate goal, here’s what you can expect as a police response and potentially a campus administrative response. Really, just put all of the options on the table. I am also meeting, and have met with, campus administrators on the issue to talk about what the parameters are if students and organizers are looking to protest at various events on campus—speakers that come to campus, groups, events, whatever they maybe—to, again, as much in advance as we possibly can, which is the best way to do it. Once it’s happening we’re all in reactive mode and we certainly want to be able to react from a place that has been well thought-out and well-planned in advance. Those are some things I am already doing to facilitate what we have already seen an increase, as you noted, in this campus protests, and we certainly have seen them in the city, and a lot of times they start on campus and move into the city. It’s about pre-planning and coordination and communicating with everybody what the expectations are. To me that’s really key.One of the things that we saw protested, and probably will continue to see protested, is the campus carry legislation that has been proposed. UWPD had signed a letter previously stating that they opposed the bill. What are your thoughts on that and what would your plan to keep campus safe if that were to pass?I am working on a revision of that letter in my name, and will look for a similar show of support from all the campus chiefs, as was the case for that initial letter. Right now I’m looking at redrafting that effort and letter. My position is the same as it was from my predecessor and I will be supporting that with the letter. That hasn’t changed; it’s still there. I think the conversation about what to do should the legislation [be proposed] is a bridge we’ll cross when we get to it. But, what we can do now, if we’re talking about a potential increase in guns on campus should that legislation move forward and succeed, we’ll be talking about measures, then, within the buildings to increase and ensure safety, which, at this point, would be about talking with faculty and staff and students who are planning to carry if they’re willing to have that conversation, about what that looks like and what concerns we’ll all have about the increase. To me it’s all about awareness, putting out information potentially about safety concerns that are tied to an increase in guns in classrooms and on campus. I’ve read some of the studies that are out there, and one of the issues that comes to mind is the point to the potential for those who would carry and increase the number of guns on campus, of course, correlates with the potential increase of violence. There’s also concern of suicide threats because there’s a lethality element that’s now more readily available. What we can do to prevent comes down to educating and an awareness and talking about it ahead of time to say “Ok, now we’re seeing a potential for individuals to be carrying within the classroom, how does that now change our awareness, our potential response, should something nefarious be born of that?” That’s getting a bit far ahead, though. From what I understand currently the conversation around this issue is what it has been in the past when it was introduced the last time. Hopefully we’ll see a similar outcome.I saw the sign taped on the door to UWPD that mentions opposing hate and bias on campus. Are there ideas you have to improve responses to incidents of hate and bias at UW-Madison?I’ll tell you I have not thought of it yet in great detail one-week in. A lot of what I hear about hate and bias, my initial thought is what kind of work we’re doing to train officers around implicit bias and cultural competency; that’s one of the first places I go. But when individuals on campus are experiencing this, for me it comes back to the trust issue. Individuals who experience that need to trust that the system will respond in a way that yields some sort sense of justice and accountability, which comes back to the question of, “Do individuals who are on the receiving end of the aggression that’s rooted in hate and bias do they feel that there’s any sort of recourse?” I would want the message to be, if there is a crime that is committed in the issuance of that kind of statement or act that we will respond and we will pursue as we are able to within the law. I think there is another education opportunity there when it comes to this issue of hate crime, like what is a hate crime, what constitutes a hate crime, what can police do, what are the thresholds and elements of a crime that would constitute a hate crime that we can respond to, because I think there is a misunderstanding about that line between a statement of protected speech versus when does it cross that line and become a crime. If the behavior that’s being demonstrated does cross that line the officers in our department will certainly respond to and pursue those as a crime.Recently, Chancellor Rebecca Blank released a statement about making UW-Madison a sanctuary campus. Do you believe that UW is a sanctuary campus, and how are you and UWPD going to ensure the safety of all undocumented students, faculty and staff on campus?This is, again, one of those issues that when you look at police as an entity I think that clearly our role for the campus community in particular is we are not currently, and we will not be, looking at documentation, requesting documentation. Our approach and role as I see it is to ensure safety and protect individuals and that will not change. I am certainly sensitive to the climate and concerns, but my assurance is that at present we are not changing our approach in any way. We want people, on a number of issues, whether it’s sexual assault or hate crime or any crime, we want individuals to feel safe and comfortable in calling the police and calling our officers to respond. We won’t be doing anything differently and we’re not going to go on some sort of a hunt to look for individuals or even individuals that we come in contact with that have concerns about their immigration status, that’s not something we are pursuing. We are not immigration, we are not ICE, we’re the university police department and we’re there to protect and serve everybody.What do you feel is an important message for UW-Madison students to keep in mind in order to keep themselves safe?It’s really about making sound choices. I think there a lot of things that students can do to promote and ensure their own safety and the safety of each other and that is common sense, helping each other out, looking out for one another. It’s moderation when it comes to most things, that’s usually going to yield in safe outcomes. For students, this is an exciting time to be here. I was a student here once upon a time and it’s big, and for a lot of people they’re coming from smaller cities to come to the university, so I know that it’s exciting and all these doors are opening to the future. You can get a little bit caught up in the excitement and in the momentum, so my advice on how to stay safe is really about pausing and thinking before jumping in. And, of course, I think there’s an awareness piece to that, too. You’re here to get an education, so read and educate yourself about a lot of the issues that are tied to safety when it comes to some of the issues we touched on. Be engaged, have fun and be smart.","New UWPD Chief hopes to repair connection between police, campus community",UWM

Disgusting. These are a few words used by the Committee on Student Organizations and the international fraternity Sigma Chi to describe the recent actions of UW-Madison’s chapter of the fraternity.Sigma Chi’s members, roughly 50 of them, participated in a chant that “encouraged sexual assault” and “contributed to a culture of fear and concern,” according to the CSO.The chant is an anthem of rape culture.Lyrics, if they can be dignified with the term, include:“We’re going to throw her against the wall and we’re going to fuck her, and then fuck her mother and sister. We’re going to line up 100 girls on the wall and fuck them until we have blue balls.”To add some words to the initial list, it is triggering, dangerous, violent and not unexpected.An assistant dean investigated the initial report and found the fraternity’s actions, though reprehensible, not unique. He stated many other groups in Greek life sang similar chants.Despite condemnation from this investigator, the CSO—whose job it is to oversee student organizations and their violations—and later representatives from the fraternity itself, the only violations resulting in the suspension of Sigma Chi deal with alcohol.True, by basic definition, these chants are protected under free speech, as a university spokesperson was quick to mention. However, there are instances when hiding behind the defense of free speech is not enough. The noose incident last fall proved this, context is important and when sexual assault is involved, it is invaluable.It could be said that yelling fire in a crowded theater, the cliché example of the limitations of free speech, creates a culture of fear and concern. On a campus in which one in four women will experience sexual assault during their time here, chanting about rape is our equivalent of shouting fire.UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone explained that “established legal principles” are the origins of the Student Organization Code of Conduct, meaning “the university can sanction speech when it meets the definition of behaviors such as harassment, discrimination, and creation of a hostile environment.”The distinction between a “hostile environment” and “culture of fear and concern,” however, is not clear.The only way the CSO pursued punishing the chant was through a hazing violation. Hazing only takes into account the discomfort of members participating in the activity. Since the chant was performed “voluntarily,” and it was “unclear if any of the membership considered the song to be degrading or humiliating,” according to the CSO, the chant wasn’t a violation.It is not a violation on this campus to willingly perpetuate rape culture. It is not punishable to memorize these words and hide complicity behind brotherhood.In the university’s initial statement about Sigma Chi’s suspension, the chant wasn’t mentioned. To the university, it was not worth mentioning. It was not worth talking about.McGlone defended this lack of mention by explaining the statement “focused on the behavior for which the chapter was sanctioned.” She also said the university is not required to release information about suspensions, and that they were forthcoming when asked for more information.The university is doing more than its required to, and informing students of suspensions is valuable. However, transparency loses its worth when information is edited and important details are not included. Choosing to leave out the chant left out an essential part of the conversation.We, as students, deserve transparent administration. We deserve to know, as a form of public service announcement, that a fraternity has done something so despicable. Our Editorial Board has said it before, we’ll say it again—transparency is not just a buzzword. It is essential to our community.If all authority voices are condemning Sigma Chi’s actions, why is there no violation? Those in charge of policing student organizations should have been able to find them in violation.If that involves changing the Student Organization Code of Conduct, these changes need to start now.In our campus climate, we cannot have rules in place that allow clear encouragement of sexual assault to continue. Actions like these cannot be called discouraging, disturbing, disrespectful and disgusting and still be accepted.Beyond policy, task forces and conversations filled with jargon, it is true that we as a campus community need to talk about this behavior. But the responsibility of defining and enforcing what is wrong on campus falls to administrators.We have only one word left: shame.How did you respond to Sigma Chi’s chant? Do you think the university’s Student Organization Code of Conduct should be changed?

Van Wagner also cited a particular message in which the victim says she does not want a casual relationship.“Nowhere in those messages did she say, ‘Leave me alone; you raped me,’ or anything along those lines,” Van Wagner said.Jokala also testified on a similar account that occurred in March 2015 and was reported shortly after the arrest, where another woman said she was penetrated with fingers against her will by Cook in his apartment. Jokala said the woman told police she attempted to stop Cook’s advances, but was “physically unable.”MPD detective Grant Humerickhouse testified that one woman reported an assault which occurred in August 2016, when she was strangled by Cook four times after telling him to stop. She reported that she could not breathe during two of those times.Humerickhouse also gave testimony on another reported assault which occurred at Cook’s apartment in February 2016. A woman told police that the defendant penetrated her after she indicated she did not want to have intercourse and was feeling “fuzzy and tired.”A total of ten women have reported sexual assault and other charges against Cook since he was first arrested last year. In October 2016, prosecutors filed 15 counts related to five women and in December 2016, six more charges were added as five more women came forward.The defendant is currently staying with his parents in Minnesota after being released on $100,000 bail in December. Other bail conditions ban him from using social media and from entering Dane County, except for court dates.Court officials have not yet set a date for trial.Request to dismiss four charges deniedIn earlier proceedings Friday morning, Bailey-Rihn denied a motion that requested the dismissal of four of 21 criminal charges in the Cook case.Bailey-Rihn ruled that there is probable cause for all counts challenged by the defendant, including one sexual assault charge, two felony stalking charges and one disorderly conduct charge.Defense attorneys filed motions Tuesday to dismiss the four charges before going to trial. The motion said that accounts from two women on the UW-Madison campus did not constitute stalking and cited conflicting information in the sexual assault charge.At the motion hearing, defense attorneys pleaded against the two stalking charges, arguing that both women’s accounts failed to meet technical definitions of stalking. Van Wagner questioned whether or not alleged women suffered “serious” emotional distress, a necessary component for stalking cases, because they failed to use certain words that define serious emotional harm when reporting their cases.Bailey-Rihn denied this argument, however, saying there is probable cause that Cook inflicted serious emotional distress on the two stalking victims, even though they may not have used technical terms such as “terrified,” “threatened,” “harassed” or “tormented” in police complaints.The judge also ruled probable cause for the two other counts, including fourth-degree sexual assault.UPDATE Jan. 20, 9:47 p.m.: This article was updated to include additional information.",Cook will face trial on 21 criminal charges,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/01/sigma-chi-chant-encouraging-sexual-assault-not-considered-violation,"January 19, 2017 | 2:30am CST","Students walking down Langdon Street Oct. 6 could not have heard a single catcall but instead a chorus promoting sexual assault. Sigma Chi fraternity house, located at 221 Langdon St., is reportedly the source of the explicit chant, according to documents obtained by The Daily Cardinal.Roughly 50 members of the fraternity chanted—about an implied woman—that they would “throw her against the wall,” have sex with her as well as “her mother and sister,” then “line up 100 girls on the wall” and also have sex with them until physically unable.Although UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone said there was “no dispute” that the chant occurred, and the committee that heard the case said it “encouraged sexual assault,” she said the decision to suspend Sigma Chi was based solely on past infractions and an alcohol-related violation during the October function.The university announced the fraternity’s suspension Tuesday; there was no mention of the chant.Assistant Dean Ervin Cox investigated the incident, which was originally reported to the university Oct. 17 and heard by the Committee on Student Organizations.Cox investigated Sigma Chi for three possible violations of policies for student organizations. Only one charge against the fraternity came as a result of the chant.The investigator met with members of the fraternity Nov. 7 to discuss these charges. At the meeting, the fraternity members present admitted to learning the lyrics before the event and then chanting the song.The next day, fraternity members sent lyrics of the song to Cox, which were nearly identical to the lyrics quoted in the first report.McGlone said that the charge relating to the chant was brought against the fraternity because the Student Organization Code of Conduct prohibits hazing. The CSO held a hearing Dec. 2 with some members of the fraternity to determine whether Sigma Chi was responsible for the possible hazing, as well as other alleged violations.As noted in the decision letter, delivered to the fraternity Tuesday, the CSO found Sigma Chi responsible for two of the code violations, but not for the charge stemming from the reported chant.The CSO determined the chanting did not constitute hazing. Therefore, the chants, which the investigator clearly said promoted sexual assault, were not a violation of any other area of the code of conduct.“In this case, the Committee primarily considered the effect of the chant on the members of Sigma Chi and University Community as well as the reliability of the information provided regarding the allegation of alcohol being present,” the CSO said in their report.In discussing the reliability of the evidence, the decision letter said “it was more likely than not that at least one member brought alcohol to the pre-social event while acting as a representative of Sigma Chi.”However, information was determined to be less reliable regarding the negative impact of the chant.“While the chant was performed voluntarily by its members, it remained unclear if any of the membership considered the song to be degrading or humiliating,” the CSO wrote in their decision. “Because the Committee had no evidence of specific adverse reaction to the chant, Sigma Chi was not found in violation of code 11.”McGlone further explained the lack of violation for the chant, saying that “the Constitution extends broad protections to speech, including speech that may be offensive.”Because of this, she said “the university through the Code of Conduct may prohibit specific behaviors, such as hazing, but may not prohibit speech simply because its content is offensive.”

The CSO did voice its strong disapproval of the chanting, despite the lack of technical violation.""It is discouraging and disturbing that no member of leadership took steps to move away from the inappropriate traditions and CSO violations of the past,"" the CSO wrote in its letter to the chapter. ""The language chanted by its membership contributed to a culture of fear and concern felt by its neighbors and the greater University community.""In a summary of his findings from the event, Cox said many other groups in Greek life sang chants like these, and that “there remains much work to be done with this population of student groups,” regarding sexual assault on campus.Executive Director of Sigma Chi Fraternity International Headquarters Michael Church issued a statement Thursday to The Daily Cardinal in response to the suspension and chant. He said that the international fraternity is ""deeply disappointed"" in the UW-Madison chapter of the fraternity because of the recitation of the sexually explicit chant, which he called ""disrespectful and disgusting.""""We fully support the university’s sanctions and are working quickly to implement an appropriate and impactful restorative justice process,"" Church said in a statement. ""Sexual violence is a pervasive issue on college campuses today and Sigma Chi will continue striving to improve education and prevention through our efforts in concert with the Fraternal Health and Safety Initiative.""Two pages from the documents obtained by The Daily Cardinal were redacted to protect the identity of the individual who filed the report.UPDATE Jan. 19, 6:15 p.m.: This article has been updated to include a response from the International Headquarters of the Sigma Chi fraternity.",Sigma Chi chant ‘encouraging sexual assault’ not considered violation,UWM

They previously ran a pilot filter during “Halloweekend” last October.The students’ filter in October was used over 1,000 times and viewed nearly 20,000 times. However, they said they believe the conversation on sexual consent should not stop after the weekend or outside of student housing.“Ideally, it would be at all Badger games hitting the same students, new students and new people, not only students,” Sklaw said. “This is not only a problem that affects students, and it’s an interesting platform to use if we can get it funded.”The filters cost between $25 and $50 and Tuesday’s pilot relied solely on donations and out-of-pocket funding. For future initiatives, the group is trying to the gain the support of Wisconsin Athletics to help run a new filter during all Badger games.Although the filter was not used as frequently during the game as in October, the group said the filter still acts as a public service announcement.“We want people to use it, but seeing it still works the same as when you scroll on filters and see an ad,” Sklaw said. “It’s marketing an idea.”The Kohl Center can hold over 17,000 people, who all could access the filter.The students are hoping to run the first fully-funded another filter, which was created by recent UW-Madison graduate Allie Geise, next weekend, with long-term goals still in mind. According to Sklaw, the administration hopes to run a filter during the Mifflin Street Block Party in May, intending to reach a large number of people at once.“The way it runs now is good but it caters to a majority of freshmen,” Sklaw said. “It really only reaches one demographic, but there is also another 30,000 students not living in dorms or on campus who we want to reach on this topic.”UPDATE Jan. 19, 7:09 p.m. This story was updated to correctly name the creators of the Snapchat filters.

Luckily, if world-class conversationalists are stylish yet weatherproof furniture, then the Almanac is the veranda of a rich southern land baron—i.e., we got you.
Here are some conversation starters to try with your next hot date.
1. Warm ups. ’Cause you gotta spark a flame to start a fire.
Do I know you?
What is your name?
How are you?
Are you lactose intolerant?
2. If you’ve gotten this far it’s likely the date is going well, and you’re probably about halfway through a coffee and/or ham sandwich. It’s time to get to know what your date is passionate about, and show them how cultural and smart you are.
What is your favorite movie?
Have you seen that video online with the lawnmower and that goat?
Did it upset you?
Did you finish watching it, anyway?
If Rocky Balboa and Clubber Lang were in a hot dog eating contest, who would win?
If Rocky got in a bar fight with Rambo, who would win?
What if Rambo was wielding a broken pool cue?
What if the Rocky that Rambo was fighting was from Rocky IV, and in peak condition after training to box Ivan Drago?
Do you think it’s implied that Rocky dies after the end of “Creed,” or do you think it’s possible a few months of pushups and eating raw eggs could see Rocky make a full recovery from cancer?
3. Closers. These are the figurative left hooks to end your date with. If all rounds of the date have gone well thus far, it’s important to throw the knockout questions and express interest in a second outing.
Would explicitly showing Rocky die at the end of “Creed” be in bad taste, or a painful but necessary step in ensuring the future protection of an American cultural legacy?
Do you think that scene from the first “Rocky” movie when Rocky doesn’t let Adrian leave his apartment until she kisses him is sexual assault, or an awkward but romantic moment that just doesn’t reflect well on him under current social norms?
Have you ever seen the movie “Rocky?”
What about the sequels?
Have you ever been so excited about something that you were afraid if you did it and nobody was around to watch over you that you might accidentally hurt yourself in your fit of excitement because you were just so passionate about a certain topic and to experience it in its pure form would be like mainlining a potent drug?

Fans’ confidence grew in hopes UW was a title contender. Following a 13-1 season with a 34-24 Orange Bowl victory over Miami, the Badgers looked primed to make the jump and be regarded as one of the nation’s best.Fourteen weeks later, UW is coming off a 37-15 beatdown by Minnesota at Camp Randall, surrendering Paul Bunyan’s Axe for the first time in 15 years. After 14 weeks, UW’s preseason ranking was perhaps the high point during a season to forget. The Badgers finished the regular season at 7-5 overall and 5-4 in the conference, good for fourth in the unimpressive Big Ten West.Although key departures clouded the defensive side of the football, putting points on the scoreboard was not something people thought would be an issue. Wisconsin averaged 33.8 points per game in 2017, and Alex Hornibrook showed improvement throughout the season, convincing media and fans alike that he was capable of being a top quarterback after a dominant Orange Bowl showing in which he completed 23 of 34 passes for 258 yards and four touchdowns.But a wide receiver group touted as one of Wisconsin’s best fell apart after Quintez Cephus was suspended indefinitely after being charged with sexual assault. An offensive group dominated by experienced starters suddenly became inconsistent. UW averaged 29.3 points per game, but that number is inflated with 40-point showings against New Mexico, Nebraska, Illinois and a triple-overtime win over Purdue, the only team on that list with a winning record.Hornibrook regressed; the redshirt junior struggled against BYU, went over three quarters without completing a pass against Michigan and threw three interceptions against Minnesota. Hornibrook finished with 13 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, and his lack of arm strength made easy throws turn into jump balls. In UW’s other two losses to Northwestern and Penn State, sophomore Jack Coan was forced to play after Hornibrook was injured. Coan played about how anyone would expect for his first real-game action but showed significant growth in his next few starts.The only thing consistent about Wisconsin’s offense came on the back of sophomore Jonathan Taylor, who finished the regular season with 1,989 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns. Behind an offensive line that had four first team All-Big Ten blockers, the Badgers leaned on Taylor every game. Taylor had almost 300 more rushing yards than the second-best rusher this season. Somehow, Taylor improved on his gaudy freshman campaign.Wisconsin staff knew they would have an extremely inexperienced defense after losing seven starters, but injuries pushed that problem to the extreme. A preseason injury forced defensive lineman Garrett Rand to miss the entire season. Cornerback Dontye Carriere-Williams left the program after losing his starting role in the summer. Two of the Badgers’ best seniors, safety D’Cota Dixon and nose tackle Olive Sagapolu, missed three and four games, respectfully. Scott Nelson, Faion Hicks, Caesar Williams, Deron Harrell and Isaiahh Loudermilk were all also forced to miss significant time due to injury. Across the defensive line and in the secondary, defensive coordinator Jim Leonhard was forced to mix and match with an assortment of freshmen and sophomores who hadn’t played last season.Despite the issues, Leonhard’s crew performed respectfully, surrendering 24.3 points per game. Wisconsin’s defense consistently kept them in games while its offense sputtered, relying heavily on senior linebackers T.J. Edwards and Ryan Connelly as the pair finished up their decorated careers. But UW struggled at pressuring the quarterback, only registering 18 sacks on the season. That lack of pressure left its young secondary exposed and it became worn down.The Badgers entered the season with high hopes, but that all came crashing down. Instead of a Big Ten Championship, UW lost the Axe and were barely bowl eligible. What a difference a year makes. ","After lofty expectations and ranking, Wisconsin's football season falls flat",UWM

""We can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it while ensuring a fair grievance process.”The new rules would limit what the education department called the “overly broad” definition of sexual harassment, and allow those accused to directly question their accusers in campus hearings.“With or without a hearing, the complainant and the respondent must have an equal opportunity to pose questions to the other party and to witnesses prior to a determination of responsibility, with each party being permitted the opportunity to ask all relevant questions and follow-up questions, including those challenging credibility, and a requirement that the recipient explain any decision to exclude questions on the basis of relevance,” the proposal stated.Proposed rules would also only require schools to investigate allegations if the assault took place in a setting directly overseen by the school and was reported to campus officials, potentially making it more difficult to investigate and prosecute as many cases under Title IX.The proposed changes come as the Association of American Universities prepares to undertake a new climate survey about sexual violence on campuses across the country.According to the last AAU study in 2015, one in four women reported being sexually assaulted during their time in college.",Education department seeks to protect individuals accused of sexual assault,UWM

For under $750 there aren’t too many options available to students without sacrificing privacy, space, comfort, or the furry friend from home. There are many different resources out there for students to find their ideal space, but hunting for the most budget-friendly option is difficult when you don’t know exactly where to begin.Apartments.com is a great resource for those looking to search by specific criteria, such as the type of home, whether or not they allow pets, whether they have parking spaces, dishwashers, and many other types of filters. The website even offers something they call POLYGON, a search tool that allows you to draw the boundaries of your search on an interactive map. Property companies like Madison Property Management, Forward Management, Steve Brown Apartments, and other campus-based apartment buildings love to list their options on this website, specifically in the POLYGON clustered around the UW campus. The only downside to this website is it’s lack of owner-managed properties available. While interacting with a landlord can be difficult, dealing with a property management company can be impersonal and frustrating.Zillow offers similar tools to the POLYGON, allowing you to draw the boundaries around your area of interest. With their filter criterias being nearly exactly similar, the only thing separating Zillow from Apartments.com is it’s inclusion of owner-managed properties in their database. Finding a deal on Zillow will be easier because you deal directly with the property manager, which in most cases is a single human being instead of a company or board of directors. Owner-managed properties are great because you can have the room to negotiate things like pets and roommates on a human-to-human level.Craigslist is a great, tried-and-true option for those wanting to search entirely for owner-based properties. It too offers plenty of search filters, but doesn’t yet have any kind of boundary-drawing software. Still, you can use the map to search for places anywhere. A lot of smaller, independent property management companies offer rentals exclusively on Craigslist; for example, one could find a small house in an area like Greenbush or Monroe for the same price as a studio apartment in The James. Despite this great advantage, Craigslist can be complicated and sketchy when communicating with property owners. Always use good judgement and never go to look at a property by yourself, unless you’re certain it will be a safe, low-risk situation.What areas of Madison are best to live it? There’s no good answer to that because it depends on what type of area you’d like to live in, and none of them and cannot be expected to be completely free of crime.Living on the isthmus can be convenient for getting to Williamson Street and the Capitol, and provides access to many great resources and venues such as Festival Foods, Willy Street Co-op, Breeze Stevens Field, the Sylvee, the Goodman Community Center, and many others. The area on East Washington affectionately nicknamed as “The Factory District” has been up-and-coming for the past three years, meaning new restaurants, bars, and activity centers are constantly popping up. The downsides? It’s expensive, and you’re not usually getting the best bang for your buck. Also the traffic can be a hassle for those commuting via car or bus. Crime is also on the rise with two reported sexual assaults along East Johnson Street in the last four months. The flooding can get really bad and parking is a hot commodity. If you don’t have a car and are comfortable living in an 150 year-old house that may or may not have assorted pests living in the walls, this is a good place for you to search.The Greenbush, Vilas, and Regent areas are good places to live that are within a 20-minute walk to the heart of campus; however, they tend to be some of the more expensive areas in Madison and approaching them without a roomate can be nearly impossible for those on a tighter budget. Luckily this area is caught between Regent and Monroe, two streets with plenty of great restaurants, fitness clubs, and plenty of job opportunities that are not necessarily catered to the flexibility needed with a full class schedule. Houses and apartments here tend to be in the $1100 - $1800 range, but rooms and studios can be found anywhere from the $500 - $900 range if space and privacy aren’t priorities of yours.Similar to the isthmus, houses here can be hundreds of years old and have many problems keeping out the cold. If your landlord does not pay for your heat, Wisconsin residents filing income taxes can take advantage of the Wisconsin Homestead Act and be reimbursed for their heating expenses on their state tax returns. Out-of-state and international students will be out of luck; heat can be very expensive, especially in houses so poorly insulated. In addition to this, fall semesters see excessive traffic during home football games; this means tailgating outside of your house at nine in the morning, many rage-inducing parking travesties, and the classic vomit-on-your-front-lawn. If this doesn’t bother you, or you enjoy partaking in the debaucherous gameday traditions, you’ll be right at home.Finally, there’s the State Street area. This is among one of the absolute worst places to live in terms of practicality, sanitation, and safety. In the early morning, the sidewalks are often covered with questionable substances and littered with trash. As all Madison residents know, State Street is filled with overwhelming, and sometimes dangerous, late-night crowds.. Traveling with groups or a friend is a good idea, as State Street after dark can be dangerous. With that being said, for between $700-$900 a month one can expect a studio or one bedroom of between 200-300 square feet, that is, a decent 10x20 foot space, around the size of a living room. The job opportunities on State Street are always abundant and prioritize hiring students, but most of the jobs start out at the lower end of the pay scale, with wages as low as $7.50 and as high as $12-$13. If you choose to work during your semester, it may be easier for you to afford living downtown. Parking is rarely included with apartments though, so unless you want to pay an additional $50-$100 to park your car at an off-site location, often outdoors and unsecured, plan on leaving the car at home. Because of its popularity in Madison culture as the “downtown” place to be and its proximity to both the UW and the Capital, this is one of the least cost efficient places to search for a campus home because you could get a lot more space for a lot less money outside of this area. If you are willing to sacrifice larger space to be in the heart of Madison and the campus area, this is a good place for you to search.Looking for multi-roommate property with an appropriate lease length will be better for those planning to live in Madison all year because of the tax deductions and the employment situation needed to fund said lifestyle. If you are an out-of-state or international student, seeking to live on-campus may offer more benefits and flexibility, as well as a more inclusive environment and more opportunities to connect with fellow students. Be aware you won’t be able to bring your pet with you, but that shouldn’t be too much of an issue if they’re waiting for you back at home.On-campus housing offers its own set of benefits and downsides. Nearly 7,500 people live in university housing, and prices vary greatly by building and location. Additionally, the newly implemented meal plan system and renovations to Witte have affected desirability and pricing this year. Information about rates and the differences in pricing between each hall can be found on the university housing website, but there are other financial factors to consider when picking a residence hall.There is a three-tier meal plan that first-year residents are required to select from, ranging in price from $1,400 to $3,100. The cost of the meal plan will be added on to their total housing costs, but returning residents can opt out. One benefit of selecting a plan is reduced resident pricing on all items in the dining halls, although others have raised concerns about negative effects it might have on campus.There is also one scholarship available specifically for residence hall housing. The Paul Evans scholarship is organized through UW’s Office of Financial Aid and through university housing. It is worth $5,000, and is given to one or two applicants who demonstrate financial need, according to Brendon Dybdahl, Director of Marketing and Communications for University Housing. Other scholarships and financial aid plans can be used on housing, but generally that money is applied to academics costs first and leftovers go towards food and housing.Becoming a house fellow in one of campus’ 19 dorm buildings can make living in the dorms more affordable as well. There are approximately 150 house fellow positions available, and working one of these positions includes free housing and a stipend. House fellows have several responsibilities, including organizing events, resolving conflicts, being on duty and acting as a resource for residents.Dybdahl said that while 92 percent of incoming UW-Madison students live in on campus their freshman year, most choose to move off-campus for the rest of their time in college. Generally, the dorms are more expensive than off-campus housing situations, but there are a few ways it can be made into a more affordable option.With that being said, no matter where you choose to live, unless you have an unlimited supply of money there will almost certainly be sacrifices made to make it work for you. Be very aware of exactly what they are and consult as many resources as you can before choosing where to settle down.Cardinal View editorials represent The Daily Cardinal’s organizational opinion.

The idea that we are now adding further limitations to that process is truly disheartening.”",State advocates raise alarms for abuse survivors in light of changes to asylum policy,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/11/the-uncomfortable-reality-of-derrick-roses-comback,"November 6, 2018 | 9:00am CST","Last week, I watched in awe as Derrick Rose dropped a career-high 50 points against the defensively-minded Utah Jazz. His quick changes of direction, and gymnastic body contortion reminded me, along with basketball fans everywhere, of the old DRose. The youngest MVP in NBA history back in 2011, Rose faced tremendous adversity in the subsequent years, undergoing three significant knee surgeries that saw his status in the league plummet from the face of the Bulls’ franchise to an oft-injured journeyman now playing for the Minnesota Timberwolves.Rose, overcome with emotion, cried following this performance, as Timberwolves players and fans stayed after to show their support. As I scrolled through Twitter, I saw tweets from current and former players, media outlets, and fans unified in their support of the forgotten superstar. The heartwarming feeling was ubiquitous and palpable, even through my timeline.However, one tweet stood out from the rest. The tweet, by @sreekyshooter, brought to light the recent rape allegation against Rose. My heart, racing with positivity and sheer joy, skipped a beat. How could I have forgotten about this? With the #MeToo movement still prominently on display — as evident by the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing — how could this not be at the forefront of my mind?The truth is, I hadn’t forgotten about it, I just wanted to believe the situation wasn’t how it seemed. “Well, he wasn’t convicted, so this shouldn’t follow him for the rest of his life, ” I told myself. “Let’s enjoy a comeback story and forget about the rest of this,” my conscious pleaded to me. Upon reading more about the case, however, it became clear that my mind was performing gymnastics similarly to the way Rose’s body does when he’s going up for a layup.During the civil trial, Rose admitted he didn’t know what consent was, and the jurors posed with him for a picture following the decision. The plaintiff is currently appealing the original verdict, which originally ruled him “not-liable,” a different decision than “not-guilty.” “Not guilty” explicitly dictates that the defendant is innocent, while “not-liable” just asserts that the evidence is too inconclusive to directly assign blame.People will point out that this case being filed in civil court, which seeks monetary compensation instead of a conviction, damages the plaintiff's credibility and intentions. This is where the case, particularly in the #MeToo context, becomes complicated. Rose faces the unique situation of facing both privilege and victimhood. Black men are more likely to be convicted and more harshly sentenced for false sexual assault allegations, while recognizable athletes enjoy a sense of judicial immunity. How does this situation fit into the current social movement? I want to believe women, but I also don’t want black men to be faced with the same type of extrajudicial convictions that are all too common in our nation’s history.In this situation, Rose’s admitted lack of understanding of consent, and the problematic nature of juror bias shape my view that he is not a saint that the basketball community should prop up on the pedestal of relentless dedication. As for how the NBA should treat Rose, that’s another conversation entirely. I do not know how an organization should punish or respond to an employee credibly accused of sexaul assault when they were found “not-liable.” Especially when this employee is a black man.The fact that the NBA community was so willing and eager to cheer on Rose after his performances demonstrates that the #MeToo movement is still far from finished. What good does this movement do if we only chastise those who we didn’t support in the first place, while continuing to support those who we look up to? I want to feel good about Rose’s redemption game, but I don’t know if I can do it in good faith. The fact that I have had to grapple with my reaction to this situation shows that, in addition to the movement as a whole, I also am far from perfect with how I respond to instances of misogyny and sexual misconduct.Based on the nearly universal positive response to Rose’s performance last week, I am confident that the sports community, along with many others, fall into this same camp. Just because the #MeToo movement is out of the constant news cycle does not mean we are exempt from continually evaluating of our perspectives. And as long as these issues plague our society, we cannot grow complacent with our imperfect feelings towards them. ",The uncomfortable reality of Derrick Rose's comeback,UWM

For 18 years, UW-Madison has hosted a Diversity Forum to recognize just that.The forum followed a report that found more than one-third of minority students feel unwelcome at UW-Madison. A task force on campus has been eager to combat these feelings by engaging in a dialogue with underrepresented students in search of improvements.""You got to have real conversations, and that sometimes can be vulnerable and scary for folks,"" UW-Madison Chief Diversity Officer Patrick Sims said. ""But that's where the breakthroughs really happen where people really let their hair hang down metaphorically and get to hearing, listening and possible learning.""From 2009 to 2018, there was a 3.3 percent increase in minority student enrollment at UW-Madison. At the same time, there was a 2.1 percent increase in minority graduate students.Currently, 10.5 percent of all undergraduates belong to marginalized communities, which includes African American, Native America, Hispanic, Latinx and Southeast Asian students. 10.6 percent of new students, including freshmen and transfers, are fit into these minority groups.Due to changing demographics of Wisconsin, 15 percent of in-state freshmen are minority students.UW-Madison’s School of Nursing has the largest amount of undergraduate minority students enrolled at 17 percent.The report also touched on faculty, noting 21.3 percent are racial and ethnic minorities. This is a 4.4 percent increase over a period of 10 years. Of those faculty members, 13.4 percent are exclusively instructional academic staff.The reports also featured reports on female students and members of faculty, first-generation students and sexual assault.During the panel, UW-Madison senior Kent Mok and graduate Miona Grae Short shared the best aspects of their college experience, noting mentors and community spirit as significant components of the campus.As a native of the Philippines, Mok discussed how he found mentors and peer support at the university via the Posse scholarship program, which recognizes high school students with academic and leadership potential that could be overlooked by college selection processes.He also said the Posse discussions provided him with a space to talk about being a student of color on a predominantly white campus with others who shared similar sentiments.Short is a spoken-word artist who became the first black woman to earn an undergraduate degree in astrophysics from UW-Madison last spring.She shared her experiences with the First Wave Learning Community on campus, which is a scholarship program that gives artistic students the opportunity to hone in on their abilities. It was here that she “met some of the best human beings in the world.”The Diversity Forum is the feature event of the Division of Diversity, Equity and Educational Achievement.","Diversity Forum reveals uptick in minority student enrollment, campus unwelcomeness",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/11/partisan-politics-divide-campus-in-wake-of-kavanaugh-confirmation,"November 1, 2018 | 9:00am CDT","Though they’re far from the Supreme Court in Washington, UW-Madison students have a lot to say about recently confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and it’s dividing campus based on political ideologies.Students voiced both support and criticism for the Justice after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s public testimony that he sexually assaulted her in high school, the subsequent hearing and his confirmation.Judge Kavanaugh was confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court on Oct. 6 with a 50-48 vote by the Senate, following a highly controversial hearing process that resulted in an FBI investigation.UW-Madison College Republicans Chairman Charlie Mueth said the confirmation is likely to increase polarization among students. Because Kavanaugh’s nomination process has been highly public and controversial, it has drawn attention from students of all political parties.“It’s disappointing, but not surprising that he was confirmed,” UW-Madison freshman Aerin Lammers said.4,477 UW-Madison students identified as liberal, 1,568 identified as conservative and 1,654 identified as moderate, a 2017 study found. Although Supreme Court Justice is a nonpartisan position, students in the majority rallied against Kavanaugh’s conservative views and in support of sexual assault survivors.“There are a lot of voices on campus that say we hear you, we listen to you, we believe you. This is going to fire people up more and say that we need to stand up and listen to survivors,” UW-Madison College Democrats Press Secretary Sam Schwab said.Many conservative students on campus had a different understanding of the trial and confirmation.“While the opposers may have been more loud, there are a vast number of moderate or conservative students at UW-Madison who always saw the qualifications of Kavanaugh and saw past the hysteria surrounding his confirmation,” Mueth said.For some Kavanaugh opposers, it was the combination of his partisan politics, behavior at the hearing and alleged history of sexual violence that caused people to doubt his ability to be an effective Supreme Court Justice.The fact that he has been accused by three women, two of whom had corroborating witnesses who were not interviewed, along with his disrespectful and partisan comments, were enough to disqualify him given that it is a nonpartisan position, Schwab said.Other students took issue with the way the hearings were conducted in general, criticizing both sides for bringing party politics into Kavanaugh’s nomination.“I think it’s a degradation of the process in general that it basically turned into a partisan mudslinging match,” UW-Madison freshman Philip Klinker said. “And even though I do think Brett Kavanaugh did assault Christine Blasey Ford, I think it wasn’t handled well by the Democrats.”The hearing and confirmation process has inspired many to further advocate against sexual assault and harassment.“For people who are paying attention, it seems students have been energized,” said Kathleen Culver, an assistant professor in UW-Madison’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication. “Young women are saying this is unacceptable, and it is nowhere near where we should be in society.”Multiple student organizations have taken action to show their support for sexual assault survivors and opposition to Kavanaugh following his confirmation.The Student Association for Reproductive Justice (SARJ) and Promoting Awareness,Victim Empowerment (PAVE) organized a forum to discuss responses to Kavanaugh’s confirmation, which included a speech by Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, and a question and answer with representatives from various organizations.“A survivor got up in front of the whole country and spoke and people didn’t believe her, and personally to me that was eye-opening,” SARJ Chair Natalia Kwiatkowska said. “There’s so many resources on campus for survivors, but then something like this happens and and you’re like ‘will people really believe survivors?’”The discussion was meant to open up a dialogue and create a safe space for students who wanted to open up or listen to other student’s thoughts, according to Noelle Filai, a social affairs intern at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.For many UW-Madison community members, the hearing signified both a lack of belief of and support for sexual assault survivors.“I would never wish for it to happen this way, but I’m happy people are awakened to the tremendous power of the Supreme Court,” Culver said.

Chris Taylor, D-Madison, joined students Tuesday evening to discuss the impacts of Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court and emphasize the importance of engaging in the political process.Hosted by Planned Parenthood and the Student Alliance for Reproductive Justice (SARJ), the event focused on Kavanaugh’s nomination process as well as conversation on how to best navigate his tenure on the bench.“It was very distressing to see a sexual assault survivor be so dismissed and belittled. The thing I think it demonstrated to me was there was a white woman who had every privilege and she still wasn’t believed. It kind of left you feeling, if she isn’t believed who is going to believe me,” Taylor said in reference to sexual assault victims.Taylor reflected on her time as a UW-Madison law student in the ‘90s mentioning her reaction to the Anita Hill hearings at the time. Taylor commented on the powers at play she believes controls much of the political process.“This established power structure does not give in easily. It is going to fight tooth and nail to preserve its power. We saw the same white men who were the same people during Anita Hill, and we saw the power structure. Kavanaugh is part of that power structure,” Taylor said.Taylor noted an increase of energized women at community meetings and forums who have not participated in activism in the past as a ray of hope.“I’m heartened because watching that horrible spectacle, I think the message that has been driven home to some women, and some men for that matter, is that nobody is going to protect our rights but us,” Taylor said.Lastly, Taylor stressed the importance of voting from young people and people of color.“If we can increase turnout by a few percentage points, you all will determine who is the next governor and if Tammy Baldwin gets re-elected to the Senate,” Taylor said.",Chris Taylor meets with students in wake of Kavanaugh confirmation,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/10/student-unions-now-offer-emergency-contraceptives,"October 23, 2018 | 9:32pm CDT","An oral emergency contraceptive is now available for purchase in both student unions at UW-Madison, and at a lower cost than name-brand equivalents.EContra EZ, an emergency contraceptive pill, can now be purchased at the Badger Markets in Memorial Union and Union South for $13. The pill is a generic version of Plan B and can be purchased without a prescription, preventing pregnancy after unprotected sex.The implementation of the drug began when Sophia Alzaidi, president of Accessible Reproductive Healthcare Initiative, began brainstorming with University Health Services staff about ways to expand the accessibility to emergency contraceptives on campus.Alzaidi said the team ultimately decided the fastest way to make emergency contraceptives available was to implement EContra EZ in the Unions.Purchased from a vendor, EContra EZ is sold for an upcharge so that the program can be self-sustaining.“The revenue that we make from the slight upcharge will account for the initial purchase of the oral contraceptive and then be able to sustain future restocks,” Alzaidi said.Despite the upcharge, EContra EZ is nearly three times cheaper than its drug-store alternatives. Alzaidi said she hopes the implementation can lessen the financial and emotional barrier that some students face when trying to acquire emergency contraceptives.“This implementation is normalizing emergency contraceptive,” Alzaidi said. “Contraceptives should be a right, not a privilege.”Alzaidi hopes to expand this implementation into a vending machine system where university community members would be able to anonymously purchase emergency contraceptive. She said this could help eliminate the stigma around emergency contraceptives and sexual assault on campus.“Emergency contraceptives can be a sensitive topic for some people,” Alzaidi said. “If someone is a survivor of sexual violence or trauma, [a vending machine system] would allow that person to get what they need without having to interact or disclose their trauma with anyone.”",Student Unions now offer emergency contraceptives,UWM

He said multiple citizens expressed worries to him about increases in school disturbances and gang membership among local teens.“Weapons offenses, stealing cars and operating them recklessly, brazen burglaries, robberies, and sexual assaults are among the litany of crimes that have generated fear and apprehension in our community,” Koval wrote. “Regrettably, the juvenile ‘justice’ system is not responding to the issues at hand.”Koval referred specifically to a recent battery and car theft incident involving four 13- and 14-year-olds, one of whom was a multiple repeat offender.“Quite frankly, at this point in time, I am NOT preoccupied in looking at what ‘caused’ these youths to transgress the law, I am more inclined to ask what the consequences will be for the behavior,” he said. “While I endorse community-based restorative justice initiatives, I draw the line at serious, felony behaviors.”Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne issued a statement responding to Koval Tuesday afternoon, disagreeing with Koval’s assessment of the justice system.Ozanne questioned whether Koval was actually interested in making sure offenders were rehabilitated rather than just punished. He identified imprisonment as merely a short-term solution to the problem, which would likely continue after release.“The juvenile’s best interests and the safety of our community are linked and it is past time we acknowledged this,” Ozanne said. “I implore the people of this county to resist the urge to turn towards more severe and harsher punishments and instead ask them to join me in demanding and creating change.”He criticized the police department’s comment that 30 juveniles were to blame for a disproportionate share of the crimes.“Is that our goal, to increase the share of crime being committed by other juveniles?” he asked. “Is creating fear of governmental institutions really our second goal? I think not.”","Madison police chief, Dane County DA trade criticisms over juvenile justice system",UWM

In a hearing, Cephus submitted both his not guilty plea and a proposal to delay the trial.According to the Wisconsin State Journal, Judge Hanrahan granted the delay of proceedings in order for the defendant to have more time to review evidence that is still being processed.Earlier this month, Cephus announced he would be filing a federal lawsuit against UW-Madison for “violating his constitutional rights to a fair investigation” since the lawsuits were brought forward simultaneously.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/10/a-year-after-it-exploded-were-still-saying-metoo,"October 11, 2018 | 9:39am CDT","Me Too. These two small words, coined by Tarana Burke in 2006 and brought into the public sphere nearly a year ago by actress Alyssa Milano on Twitter, have since sparked a widespread campaign for women’s rights.In the days following the first post, 24,722 people tweeted the hashtag. A year later, sexual assault is still a prominent topic at UW-Madison, where 1 in 4 women report being sexually assaulted during college.On the same day as Milano’s tweet, an anonymous female college student reported being sexually assaulted at a house on Langdon Street. The investigation that followed was one of 11 sexual assault investigations at UW-Madison in 2017. The assault was one of 318 reported in that year, according to the UW Division of Student Life.Total sexual assaults reported on campus increased since 2011. Though the increase means more assaults are occurring, it also means students feel an increased level of comfort in coming forward.60 percent of UW-Madison students said they believed it is very unlikely that a student making a report would be supported by other students, according to a Campus Climate Survey administered by the American Association of Universities in 2015. More than 70 percent of students said it is very unlikely a report would be taken seriously by campus officials.But the #MeToo movement has changed the conversation, according to UW-Madison students.“I know so many women, and even some men, that opened up about their experiences by posting about the #MeToo movement,” UW-Madison senior Naomi Venezia said. “It really fueled discussion and made it a more visible topic.”Venezia has been an outspoken advocate of sexual assault prevention, leading campus support group K(No)W More in which women on campus, many of whom are involved with Greek life, share their stories.A disproportionate number of sexual assaults take place in fraternities, according to UW-Madison Title IX Coordinator Lauren Hasselbacher. Fraternity men are three times more likely to commit rape than their non-greek counterparts.“This sets up expectations of how the night should end,” Venezia said.“I think the hookup culture has a very strong influence on our behaviors and social life when it comes to interactions with the opposite genders.”A UW-Madison Bias Incident Report details an event from October 2016 in which the chapter of Sigma Chi chanted the following lyrics:“He once lined 100 girls up against the wall, and bet a Beta $10 he could fuck ‘em all.He fucked 98 till his balls turned blue, then he backed off, jacked off and fucked the other two.”The Committee on Student Organizations ruled Sigma Chi was not in violation of Code 11 which outlines activity that “humiliates, degrades, abuses, endangers, sexually violates, causes emotional and/or physical harm or requires a person to give up personal liberty regardless of the person's willingness to participate.”A CSO report from 2016 details the account of an anonymous individual who heard 80 to 90 Alpha Epsilon Phi girls singing from the basement of Sigma Alpha Mu:“They roll me over and lift up my dress, now that I’m in AEPHI I will always say yes.”The women of Alpha Epsilon Phi were put on probation, while the fraternity house where the song took place, Sigma Alpha Mu, saw no consequences.Though the #MeToo Movement has revealed sexual assault is a real problem, some universities still lack certain training to decrease assault rates.30 percent of institutions in the national sample do not provide any sexual assault training for students, let alone focused training for areas of higher risk, stated a U.S. Senate report on sexual assault.22 percent of schools in the survey provide sexual violence training targeted at the Greek system, and 37 percent provide training specifically for student athletes. These numbers increase significantly for schools involved in Division I athletics, where 64 percent of schools target training at the Greek system and 82 percent target training for student athletes.Despite these trainings, assaults by athletes happen. This past August, two women reported they were assaulted by Quintez Cephus, a wide receiver for the Badgers. Cephus is being charged with second- and third-degree sexual assault for an incident that occurred this past April, in which the women said they were unable to give consent.One of the women reported to police that she wasn’t sure how it happened, but she and her friend were naked and Cephus was assaulting them. The other woman, in an interview with police, said after drinking at the Double U she was so intoxicated she didn’t remember being introduced to Cephus.“UW-Madison views allegations of sexual violence with deep concern,” Hasselbacher said in response to Cephus’ allegations. “We responded following our standard practices, which include providing reporting and support resources to anyone who has reported experiencing sexual misconduct.”Additionally, UW-Madison continually ranks high in college towns and student bodies with high alcohol consumption and binge drinking, which is the leading predatory drug used in sexual assaults on college campuses, according to UW-Madison’s Alcohol-Facilitated Sexual Assault briefing document.“We know from research that alcohol consumption does correlate with sexual assault, both for perpetrators and those they victimize,” Hasselbacher said. “And of course, if someone is incapacitated due to alcohol, that person is not able to consent.”UW-Madison requires training for all registered student organizations, not just Greek life and athletics. The program, called “Badgers Step Up!” focuses on leadership development, bystander intervention, alcohol education, resources and UW-Madison policies related to alcohol.In the spirit of the #MeToo movement, the UHS website reads, “To the survivors on our campus, we see you, we support you, and we are here for you. Help is available.”UHS programs like GetWise, ActWise and U Got This! aim to further raise awareness on campus.“Increased awareness of the prevalence and impact of sexual violence is critical in shifting people’s attitudes and behaviors, which can provide the public support often needed to produce policy change,” Zemke said.The #MeToo movement and discussions about sexual assault have been reignited in light of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Hundreds of students and Madison community members gathered last Thursday to protest Kavanaugh’s confirmation and show support for Ford, many carrying signs that read “#MeToo.”As the #MeToo movement has grown throughout the nation, students have become more vocal about their experiences with sexual violence. UW-Madison will administer a survey asking about sexual violence in the spring.“Sexual assault survivors all have one thing in common: we all are still here, standing strong and now breaking the silence,” Venezia said. “It is 2018, we need to say no more to one in four.”Infographics by Channing Smith and Photo by Dana Brandt ","A year after it exploded, we’re still saying “#MeToo”",UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/10/taking-the-qs-out-of-queer-sex,"October 11, 2018 | 7:53am CDT","Preesented by Sex Out Loud’s Rhys Fritz, Volunteer Coordinator and Rosie Rodriguez, Program FacilitatorRhys: Hi y’all, I’m Rhys. At this point, I could write a book or maybe two dissecting my problematic and practically non existent sex education, but because we don’t have time for that I’m going to focus on the absence of queerness in my Catholic school sex education.I would like to note, that I am not here to bash Catholicism or rather, any religious practice that promotes the ideology of abstinence or waiting until marriage/partnership/etc. What we do with our bodies is our business, and I’m down with that. But what I do want to identify is the impact of taking away necessary components of safety and pleasure in sex ed and what it does for those in the queer community.So, what is it about Catholic school that is just so sexy? Whenever I even mention that I spent 13 of my most formative years tucked inside a school that spewed the word of God and made sure our skirts hit the floor instead of our knees, it’s as if a tiny alarm goes off in the other person goes - wow that’s really hot. And while I wish that my experience was that of being God fearing while giggling in a plaid skirt, I’m afraid my experience was far from that.Every day, we would tuck into a dim brick building, sweating from our polyester blend polo shirts and general teenage sweatiness and count our blessings to get the hell out of there. It is within those walls that while they were preparing me for a bigger world of academics, they prepared me less and less for what would inevitably come: me. Oh, and sex.At least one time per year we would be administered religious studies books and here I would learn that sex was for marriage, that sex was between a man and a woman, and that our one job through the sacrament of marriage was that of a holy, baby making machine. Yes, one day I would find the man of my dreams who would bless me with screaming, pooping, sleeping life. Beautiful. In these classes, we learned basic anatomy of MEN and WOMEN and watched the Miracle of Birth that still has scared me to this day. Isn’t that worth waiting for? Or I guess maybe it would be if I weren’t this genderless ball of queerness that no one ever really explained to me. Personally, I can’t wait to return to my high school reunion, guns blazing (figuratively), bringing my kinky, queer energy into a place that sucked the joy from my left rib.Rosie:My name’s Rosie, and I went to public school here in Madison. In middle school we had health classes taught by our gym teacher that mostly focused on the food pyramid and not doing drugs, but always saved a week or two towards the end to make sure we also didn’t have sex. At my family’s church, we had a whole youth group curriculum on abstinence. It told me that if I had sex before marriage, I would be like a licked Jolly Rancher stuck back in its wrapper: undesirable and belonging to the trash. I’m not even kidding, we literally did that activity.  In high school, I had the most extensive health class; we watched a baby be born, saw pictures of herpes, passed around a few contraceptives from the 90s, and called it a day in terms of sex. No queer people, no pleasure, no consent, and certainly no discussions about the way society constructs and reconstructs norms around sex and sexuality in a way that promotes assault and ill health.I figured out I was bi somewhere in the middle of all this, and I figured it out thanks to the library. I would go there after school and browse through any book that looked like it could clue me in to whatever was going on in my body. Puberty guide from American Girl (yes, the doll company)? Read it cover to cover. The handful of lesbian erotica novels in the adult section? Mostly worn down because of me. The one thick book of queer theory hidden in the stacks by the cookbooks? I racked up $20 in late fees on that book that I haven’t paid back yet. Madison Public Library will always have a special place in my heart for teaching me about gay sex and private browsing, but it shouldn’t have had to.That’s why I work for Sex Out Loud. Specifically, this is why I manage the SOL Library and work with Rhys on Queeries. Because I believe everyone should have access to the knowledge they need to have consensual, safe sexual experiences that are pleasurable and make their lives better. I also know that queer people have the hardest time with getting pleasure-centric and sex positive education about their bodies. We can do better, and doing better by queer people on our campus is what these articles are all about.What is Queer Sex?Queer sex can be whatever we want it to be! In porn and media we often see a very prescriptive view of sex, queer or otherwise, that can limit our sexual imaginations and make us feel like we’re “doing it wrong.” Part of queering sex ed is breaking down those notions because there is no right way or wrong way to have sex! Sex is any pleasurable and sexy activity between two (or more) consenting adults, and that can mean whatever we want it to.It’s also important to acknowledge that this is easier said than done for many queer folks because we are far more likely to have past experiences with sexual assault. Many folks in our community also have issues with body dysphoria (disliking parts, or the whole, of our bodies). To help make our partners feel sexier and more comfortable, we need to communicate with them and be compassionate to their wants and desires. We recommend discussing language, supplies, and activities as foreplay- before we’re in the high pressure and naked environment of the bedroom. Here are some questions to get started:When was the last time you were tested?What type of protection do you like to use?What language do you use about your body?Do you like butt stuff? What about oral?What’s your favorite kind of lube?Do you want to use toys? What kind? Yours or mine?Are there parts of your body you like touched? Don’t like touched?Tell me what you like!As queer people, we get the gift of self-defined sex. For many people whose partners have penises that can mean penetrative sex or blow jobs and for just as many that isn’t what they prefer. For many people whose partners have vulvas, clit stimulation or fingering may be part of the routine, but again that’s not what all people do. There is nothing in the world of sex that we can say “all people do!” What’s important is prioritizing communication, pleasure, and safety. For all people!",Sex Column: Taking the Q's out of queer sex,UWM

We believe Anita Hill.”These words punctured the chill of autumn as hundreds of determined protestors marched down Langdon Street to the beat of their own chants.On Thursday, UW-Madison students and community members participated in the #CancelKavanaugh Walkout Against Sexual Assault in response to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s trial.The protest was part of a national call to action by the International Women’s Strike. People marched in solidarity with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Anita Hill and all other sexual violence survivors in cities ranging from Seattle to Washington D.C.“It’s mind-boggling that more disruption is not happening,” said Sylvia Johnson, a member of the International Socialist Organization and vocal leader of the protest.Multiple student groups, including Madison’s Socialist Alternative, Bell Magazine and PAVE, garnered the attention of students and led the movement on campus.After assembling in Library Mall, Johnson led protestors as they marched down Langdon Street to the Capitol building. Leading organizers, like ISO, forefronted the march by holding a large banner advocating for reproductive rights.Students leaned from balconies of fraternities and sororities, some cheering along with the crowd below and others watching in silence.“We have to build a movement against sexual assault. This is a small step towards a bigger movement,” protestor Noah Calligan said during the march.The start of the walkout brought some resistance from a counter-protestor who yelled from the sidelines. Protestors raised their voices and built a wall around him until he left.“Shatter the silence. Stop the violence,” they chanted.When the crowd reached the Capitol, a line of survivors formed on the steps to share their stories, speaking into a microphone before the captivated audience.Survivors, both young and old, gave personal testimonies to which audience members responded “we believe you.”A member of the Raging Grannies, a progressive singing group of elderly women, sang about justice just after a college student spoke about an assault that occurred minutes away from the Capitol.Shouting at the windows of the Capitol, protestors targeted their demands at the legislators within.“What Kavanaugh means is a lifetime appointment to create a right-wing majority on the supreme court,” Johnson said. “We believe that we have to act right now.”Ford’s testimony of sexual assault against Kavanaugh has drawn national interest and has been a catalyst for feminist and pro-choice groups. But activist groups are not the only ones interested in the recent investigation, as Ford's story has resonated with many students.“I watched the entire hearing,” student Aaron Gholston said. “Christine’s testimony was powerful and helped me reconsider and realize how women are affected by not just one, but a lifetime of incidents.

With gangsta rap, Shashko said, the voice that hip-hop supplied to marginalized black males in America would lash out against other marginalized people.Colleen Whitley, president of MASA, wanted Shashko to speak at a meeting after taking one of his classes.“With Men Against Sexual Assault, we try to explore and create a safe space for men to not fit into that box of strength or violence as their only valid emotion and to become individuals,” Whitley said. “In his class, the way he expresses himself shows that individuality and shows that men can talk about these issues and stand up against misogyny.”While Shashko is no stranger to lecturing, he said there were differences between being a guest speaker and teaching in his class.“[Lecture] is a more effective space to weave the tension between hip-hop’s strengths and limitations,” Shashko said. “[As a guest speaker], it is more like giving a disclaimer: ‘here are all the reasons gangsta rap is important, and now we’re going to get to the topic at hand.’”Whitley said she was pleased with Shashko’s speech and hopes to continue this conversation on a broader scale.",UW-Madison Professor speaks on misogyny in hip-hop,UWM

PAVE said they stand with all survivors of sexual violence regardless of “race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender (or rejection thereof), age, ability status, sexual orientation, religion (or rejection thereof), or level of education.”“The PAVE staff felt that this was an especially prominent issue of the recent news cycle and wanted to make a strong statement condemning not only the actions of our government but also our university,” said PAVE Communications Coordinator Alexandra Hader.PAVE recognized their disappointment in the way UW-Madison and the Title IX office has responded to reports of violence. According to Hader, PAVE’s frustration stems from the universities inaction on reports of sexual violence. The student organization wants to see the university support survivors, not assailants.In the statement, PAVE said the university should “create an environment where survivors not only feel comfortable coming forward, but feel safe and supported coming forward.”“The university has to begin to focus on the best interest of survivors and begin to take stronger stances in how reported sexual assault cases are dealt with,” Hader said. “Putting survivors in a position to choose how to proceed gives them the power and can help in avoiding the retraumatization of survivors.”The statement called for action to be taken on campus, pleading for “individuals in power” within the university to stand up for survivors of sexual violence.

Unfortunately, the message the Judiciary Committee sent today is that Dr. Ford is lying. This is exactly the reason that so many survivors do not report their assault.”Ford recounted in graphic detail to the Senate committee how Kavanaugh, along with a friend of his, allegedly locked her in a room at a house party and groped her, while holding his hand over her mouth to silence her screams.“Dr. Ford, Julie Swetnick, and the other accusers of Brett Kavanaugh have sacrificed their privacy, safety and normal lives in order to speak their truth,” Patty Seger, executive director of End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin, said Friday. “Their principled stand is nothing less than an act of heroism, and Dr. Ford’s testimony is deserving of nothing less than full consideration by the 100 members of the US Senate who now hold the future of Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment in their hands.”Several moderate Republican senators, notably U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake of Utah, voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination, but claimed to do so under the understanding that the Senate floor vote would be delayed to allow an investigation to take place.But with Republican leadership eager to place another conservative on the Supreme Court, it would be extremely unlikely that they would cooperate with a further delay of confirmation.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has the vote on pace for this Tuesday.",State advocates condemn advancement of Kavanaugh confirmation,UWM

We cannot trust Brett Kavanaugh to respect the bodies of individual women in his personal life; how, then, can we trust him to adjudicate justly on women’s bodily autonomy?Once again, the fate of millions of people — primarily the most marginalized — rests squarely in the hands of one rich white man, personally selected by second rich white man, confirmed by a jury of mostly rich white men.I understand the impulse to disassociate with this catastrophe. As wealthy capitalists sit in an ornate room choosing, decidedly undemocratically, whether a serial sexual assailant should serve in one of the most critical governmental positions, workers in Madison may feel understandably disconnected and powerless.I also understand, as you search for an outlet for your frustration, the impulse to channel your progressive energy into the pocketbooks of Democratic candidates. This strategy does not work. It has not worked, as Democrats have repeatedly pivoted away from reproductive rights once elected and have continuously supported and voted for the Hyde Amendment, banning federal funding for abortion access.Sometimes, you might feel alone in this fight. But you are not. There are allies everywhere in the fight for reproductive justice. Pro-choice activists are on campus and they are organizing tirelessly. On Saturday, Madison’s branch of the International Socialist Organization hosted a speakout on Library Mall in protest of Kavanaugh’s nomination, in support of abortion rights and access, and in solidarity with survivors of sexual assault everywhere.This Thursday, the ISO is hosting a meeting to discuss “#MeToo and the Supreme Court” in order to effectively mobilize the Madison community to fight for women’s bodily autonomy. It will be in room L196 of the Education Building at 7 p.m.If you are pro-choice, the ISO is your ally in this fight. This struggle is not without enemies, however. When ISO members posted flyers for the meeting and speakout last week, they were shadowed by right wingers, and the flyers were ripped down. When members chalked event information outside of Memorial Union, it was washed away, twice by individuals and, finally, a third time by Union employees. At the speakout, a man spent several minutes shouting “murder” at pro-choice activists.Anti-choice activists travel to clinics that provide abortions and effectively shut them down, harassing doctors and clients alike. These actions destroy countless lives every year.The right has been organized and organizing around fighting against reproductive rights for quite some time. They have mobilized a grassroots base that moves swiftly and as one. It’s time for the pro-choice movement to do the same.We must build a mass movement for the right to choose, and it must start locally.

Toward the end of the nomination process accusations of sexual harassment arise.Law professor Anita Hill testifies in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Oct. 11. Accounts of crude behavior and language are revealed for the first time in history within the walls of the orthodox Senate hearing room. Her testimony is dismissed by the all-white an all-male committee.The day is Oct. 15. Judge Thomas has been confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 52-48. Despite widespread allegations, numerous news stories and hard evidence, justice has not served Anita Hill.The year is now 2018. Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to fill the seat left empty by recent retiree Justice Anthony Kennedy. The nomination of Judge Thomas is again supported by conservatives, yet strongly opposed by feminist and civil rights groups citing his threat to women’s right to choose, voting rights, racial justice, LGBTQ+ rights and much more.

Ford will testify to the Senate on Sept. 27.And now, only one question remains: Will justice serve Ford, Ramirez and Swetnick, or will Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed Justice to the highest court of the land?Recent events make it difficult to distinguish between the past and the present; it calls into question the progress that is thought to have been made. Racial tensions spark thoughts of the 1950s and ‘60s. Looming threats to women’s rights, particularly regarding reproduction, take us into the era of Roe v. Wade and the women’s suffrage movements. And now the nomination and accusations against Brett Kavanaugh have taken us back into the early ‘90s.Nearly three decades later, history is quite literally repeating itself, especially when comparing some of the details of each nomination. Will things be different this time around?It is possible, for we are being given the opportunity to provide Dr. Ford, Ramirez and Swetnick the dignity that was not given to Anita Hill not so long ago. Conversely, will privileged men, yet again, be given the power to make decisions affecting millions of Americans across the country despite popular disapproval? Potentially, yes.Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination has provoked many questions that continue to go unanswered. In a time when it is possible — even necessary — to change the course of history, what can be done by us, the people? It is vital for constituents to call into the offices of their senators.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/09/wisconsin-iowa-player-to-watch-davis,"September 21, 2018 | 6:00pm CDT","After being upset by BYU, Wisconsin looks to rebound with a strong showing against Iowa this Saturday. One of the keys for Wisconsin this week will be putting the ball in the air.Wisconsin’s offense had high expectations coming into the 2018 season, not only because of their star running back — sophomore Jonathan Taylor — but also their talented receiving corps. However Wisconsin started the season without two of its top three receivers: junior Quintez Cephus, who was suspended indefinitely after being charged with two counts of sexual assault, and sophomore Danny Davis, who was suspended for his involvement in the incident, according to the police report. As a result, junior receiver A.J. Taylor has had to take over as the lead man for the start of the season. With Taylor impressing so far this season, Wisconsin is looking for another receiver to step up and help out junior quarterback Alex Hornibrook.Danny Davis is the guy.After sitting out the first two games, Davis failed to live up to his expectations in his 2018 debut, catching just four passes for 40 yards with a pair of drops.This week, the Badgers will need to target Davis frequently and get him more involved in the offense, as he played an important role in Wisconsin’s win over Iowa last year. Facing off against star Iowa cornerback Josh Jackson — who was taken in the second round of the NFL draft this spring — Davis showed out, catching four passes for 74 yards.This year, Iowa’s defensive line is stacked. The Hawkeyes rank third in the country in sacks, with 12 in three games. Iowa’s defensive plan will start with slowing down Heisman candidate Jonathan Taylor and forcing Hornibrook to throw the ball. With Josh Jackson out of the picture, the Badgers will need to take advantage of Iowa’s inexperienced secondary by targeting Davis deep and on the outside to stretch the field vertically and horizontally.At 6’0” and 196 pounds, Davis has the ability to speed past Iowa’s defense as he looks to get over the top for a deep ball, along with the strength to gain extra yards after the catch. Davis proved to be among the top receivers in the Big Ten last year, and a nationally televised matchup against a division rival gives him a chance to shine as he gets back into his rhythm.",Danny Davis's return to form brings much-needed deep threat to Badgers' passing attack,UWM

Though Hill has been banned from Whitewater, Kopper now faces scrutiny from those who believe she may have been aware of her husband’s actions.The investigation began earlier this year, after a total of three women who worked for UW-Whitewater came forward with allegations of harassment against Hill. He held an unpaid position as Associate of the Chancellor since 2015.According to city councilwoman Stephanie Vander Pas, Hill made inappropriate comments to her, and at one point slid his hand up her skirt. Another female employee said that during a university-sponsored event, Hill repeatedly squeezed her knee and attempted to kiss her. All three women brought up other accounts of physical contact and comments by Hill.Though Hill denied the allegations — even explaining the knee incident by saying that he had to move his female colleague’s leg to massage a cramp in his own leg — UW System President Ray Cross was not convinced.“We have determined that the allegations have merit, and we are ending Mr. Hill’s unpaid academic staff appointment as Associate of the Chancellor, effective immediately,” said in a statement sent by Cross to Chancellor Kopper regarding her husband's actions.Due to the personal relationship between Hill and Chancellor Kopper, however, the case is still being reviewed by the UW System to determine what, if any, responsibility Kopper has and if she should resign.Councilwoman Vander Pas, one of the women who came forward about the harassment, mentioned in a Facebook post that Kopper should take some of the blame for her husband’s actions and implied she couldn’t have been unaware of what was going on.According to UW-Whitewater spokesperson Sara Kuhl, Kopper does not intend to resign and continues to support the termination of her husband’s university position, despite the ongoing investigation.",UW-Whitewater chancellor pressed to resign amidst accelerating sexual assault investigation,UWM

If he could avoid a lengthy case, he wouldn’t be the first big-school athlete to avoid salacious charges and get back on the field.In a court hearing Tuesday, any chance of that effectively crumbled.Cephus was ordered by a judge to stand trial after failed attempts from his lawyers to have the charges dismissed. The trial date has not yet been set.That development — a non-conclusion of sorts — means Cephus could well take this season in from the sidelines under his current suspension.In some ways, the suspension of Cephus was simply a bureaucratic, mandatory decision. As per the Student-Athlete Discipline Policy, which the athletic department cited in its decision, “Arrests of or charges of specified crimes will result in immediate suspension and factual inquiry.”Still, it is encouraging to see a sexual assault case involving an athlete handled so quickly and assertively.Florida State infamously protected Jameis Winston after he raped student Erica Kinsman in 2012. Michigan State was accused in January of acting indifferent towards the sexual assault cases of athletes, including some on the football team.Time and time again, athletic aspirations supersede common sense. Not here, at least.For a team with playoff aspirations, Cephus’ suspension — if continued — could prove to be a massive blow to the team down the line. Before injuring his right leg and missing the last five games of the season, Cephus averaged over 55 receiving yards per game.But production is more malleable than reputation.Wisconsin could’ve swept Cephus’ misconduct under the rug, pulled a couple of favors with the police and kept Cephus out of the news and on the field. They wouldn’t be the first to do something like that, but they didn’t.I can’t tell you whether that’s down to confidence in other players, out of a desire to legitimately protect against sexual violence on campus or to simply adhere to the athletic department’s own policy (which it probably could have contradicted had it really wanted to).But what I can tell you is that Cephus’ suspension is the welcome common-sense decision which is so often lacking from the tribalistic world of college football.Wisconsin may have higher stakes than most teams to bury misconduct such as Cephus’. But its growing profile also necessitates a need to avoid controversy and act an in an exemplary manner.It shouldn’t be surprising that college kids, even with lots at stake, sometimes make terrible decisions that hurt people. But universities themselves should be held to a higher standard.For now, Wisconsin is setting that bar.","Column: In Quintez Cephus case, Wisconsin is one program doing things the right way",UWM

The startling coordinated stomps, shrieks, and screams urged Linda to turn to her favorite social media platform to rant about her horrendous experience. “I didn’t know it was possible for teenage girls to act like that…they were animals… I felt like I was watching a combination of a mating ritual and a sacrifice to one of their ancient gods…” Linda stated in her third outraged post, which got over 10,000 likes.“I was too focused during my hourly meditation walk… I didn’t want to end up in that place… I don’t ever want to go back…”Linda isn’t the only person concerned for the sanity of Greek Life participants, as many of the more wholesome students had equally traumatizing experiences.Other accounts included high-pitched and indistinguishable chanting, ceremonial dances involving large metal poles as props, and embroidery of the Greek alphabet directly into the skin of new pledges.

Two women accused him of assaulting them while drunk. Cephus has denied any wrongdoing , but remains indefinitely suspended from the football team.“I’m innocent. I know the truth. They know the truth,” Cephus said. “I look forward to clearing my name and fighting for who I am.”His roommate, fellow wide receiver Danny Davis, was present during the alleged incident, but has not been charged. He was suspended from the football team for two games, which have been served.At a preliminary hearing Tuesday, Dane County Judge Jill Karofsky rejected a motion from Cephus’ lawyers to have one of the charges dropped. His lawyers claimed to have video proof that one of the women was not drunk, but Karofsky decided the video did not show enough to prove anything.A Madison police detective, backed up many of the claims in the criminal complaint filed against Cephus in her testimony at the hearing. Karofsky determined this qualified as probable cause against Cephus and ordered him to stand trial.After the hearing, Cephus and his lawyers again professed his innocence.“All three people who were in that room that night knew exactly what they were doing,” said Kathy Stilling, one of Cephus’ defense lawyers. “We are looking forward to getting out all of the facts and to clearing this fine young man's name.”",Judge orders Cephus to stand trial for sexual assault charges,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/09/former-walk-on-dunn-stepping-up-with-starters-sidelined,"September 6, 2018 | 9:00am CDT","Wisconsin’s wide receiver depth, viewed as a considerable strength following the group’s strong performance down the stretch in 2017, recently took a hit when starters Quintez Cephus and Danny Davis were implicated in reports of a sexual assault in the spring. In need of a boost in the passing game, the Badgers have turned to young players who otherwise may not have seen much time. In Friday’s victory over Western Kentucky, Jack Dunn was one of those players.Dunn, a former walk-on, is a redshirt sophomore who starred at Madison’s Edgewood College, only a mile from Camp Randall Stadium. After playing in eight games in 2017, mostly on special teams, he appears poised to claim a larger role in the offense this season. In the victory over Western Kentucky, Dunn reeled in a 20-yard reception on a 3rd-and-long in the second quarter, helping to set up Kendric Pryor’s two-yard touchdown in the waning moments of the first half. He also served as the primary punt returner.New Mexico’s defensive weaknesses will give Dunn the opportunity to make a splash in the second game of the season. Last year, the Lobos finished 3-9 and gave up nearly 32 points per game. That included 240 passing yards per contest and 28 total touchdowns through the air. They also gave up a healthy 10 yards per punt return. The defense experienced similar issues in their season opener on Saturday, giving up 30 points and 328 passing yards to FCS opponent Incarnate Word.The Lobos defense will likely focus on stopping the run game while limiting the impact of Kendric Pryor, A.J. Taylor, tight end Jake Ferguson and the running backs in the passing game. This could leave opportunities for Dunn to expose openings in a run-of-the-mill secondary and provide an outlet for Alex Hornibrook under pressure.The newfound opportunity and occasionally porous defense Dunn will face Saturday will give him the opportunity to continue to earn reps and prove that he deserves increased playing time, even when conference play begins and Danny Davis presumably returns. As a face of the next generation of Wisconsin wide receivers, Dunn will be a player to keep an eye on against New Mexico and throughout the season to come as defenses grapple with ways to slow down the balanced Badgers offense.

Without top-10 Penn State or Ohio State on the schedule, Wisconsin breezed through its regular season, going undefeated with the final win an exclamation point shutout over rival Minnesota to finish 12-0. The Badgers were ranked No. 4 by the College Football Playoff committee going into the Big Ten title game against Ohio State. UW lost 27-21 in heartbreaking circumstances, and were out of the Playoff standings. Despite the disappointment, Wisconsin rebounded to capture a 34-24 Orange Bowl victory over the Miami Hurricanes in their own stadium. Quarterback Alex Hornibrook showed promise in the season-ending victory, throwing no picks and four touchdowns. In the ultimate breakout season, freshman running back Jonathan Taylor went from third-stringer entering fall camp to the third-best rushing mark for a freshman in NCAA history.This SeasonWisconsin was in the news even before the opening kickoff when junior wide receiver Quintez Cephus took a leave of absence and was subsequently suspended for a pair of sexual assault charges. Fellow receiver Danny Davis was also suspended for a pair of games for his alleged involvement in the incident, leaving the Badgers down a pair of offensive contributors entering the season. On the field, Taylor picked up right where he left off in the first game against Western Kentucky, running for 145 yards and two scores as the Badgers won 34-3. Hornibrook also threw two touchdowns and came within a yard of his career high in passing, while the offense looked very confident as the game progressed. The defense, despite losing seven staters to graduation and the NFL, showed some cracks against the pass but managed to hold the Hilltoppers when it counted, getting two red zone turnovers to shift the momentum and hold WKU without a touchdown. Until the Big Ten season starts at Iowa, UW shouldn’t face too many tests, but the early signs are promising for another good run to the Big Ten Championship game.Player to WatchSeniors Alec James, Chikwe Obasih, Leon Jacobs and Connor Sheehy had anchored the defensive line for multiple years, but all four are now graduated. Their presumed replacement, sophomore Isaiahh Loudermilk, is out with a knee injury and is unlikely to return until at least the beginning of Big Ten play. Until then, senior defensive tackle Olive Sagapolu is the only experienced member of a unit that traditionally anchors the UW defense. In need of bodies, redshirt freshman Kayden Lyles converted from offensive line to defensive line during spring camp, while freshman defensive end Matt Henningsen has also taken on a bigger role. The Badgers only had one sack against Western Kentucky and at times struggled to contain Hilltopper quarterback Drew Eckels. Sagapolu is easy to project as a big body in the middle who will eat up blockers, but Lyles, Henningsen and eventually Loudermilk will need to step up significantly if Wisconsin is going to break through their Big Ten Championship ceiling.–Bremen KeaseyMen's Soccer2017 was a historic year for the Wisconsin Badgers men’s soccer team. They won the Big Ten Tournament for the first time since 1995 and reached the Round of 16 in the NCAA Tournament. Chris Mueller led the nation in assists with 20 — the most in Division 1 since 2004 — and was drafted in the first round of the Major League Soccer draft by Orlando City SC. Wisconsin scored 45 goals last season with a potent attack lead by Mueller, along with forwards Tom Barlow and Mike Catalano who each hit double digit goals, and Mark Segbers who notched an additional seven assists. All four of those attackers have graduated and are in the professional ranks, and the Badgers are now led by a strong spine of veterans and young attackers.This SeasonThe Badgers have had a mixed season so far, posting a 2-2-0 record in their first four games. Wisconsin was ranked 15th to start the season, but lost their opener 2-1 on the road to Grand Canyon University. After returning to Madison and earning a 2-0 win over Hartford, the Badgers suffered a heartbreaking overtime 1-0 loss to the No. 15 Fordham Rams at home in a game where they had many of chances to put away the game earlier. UW bounced back with a 1-0 win against Valparaiso in a downpour before to get back to .500 before a Illinois road trip.Player to WatchWith the sudden loss of four key attacking players to the professional ranks, UW is looking for a new group of forwards to recharge the offense. Collectively, the young forwards are the players to watch this season as the Badgers look to defend their Big Ten Tournament title. Freshman forward Andrew Akindele has had the best start to the season, scoring one goal and assisting another, freshman midfielder Olafur Olafsson has looked dangerous on the flank and has an assist, freshman forward Noah Melick got into a grove against Valparaiso, nearly scoring two goals and freshman forward Charles Spragg has played for the New Zealand U-20 national team. Wisconsin’s search for replacements looks promising, and the team will do well if the young attackers can find some goals.–Bremen KeaseyWomen's SoccerLast SeasonWisconsin standout Dani Rhodes scored 11 goals last season, a third of the team’s total tally, en route to a 14-6-2 record. Highlights of the season included a win 1-0 in Charlottesville against the then-No. 3 Virginia Cavaliers — the school’s highest-ranked victory in program history. Rhodes scored the winner in that game, and freshman forward Cammie Murtha scored six goals last season including five game-winners of her own. After reaching the NCAA Tournament, the Badgers got a 5-0 win over Toledo in the first round but in a tough draw, they had to play No. 1-seeded South Carolina. Despite a 1-0 loss, things look promising for the Badgers as they return nine of their 11 starters this season.This SeasonWisconsin has had a strong start to the season, going 4-1-0 with their only blemish a 3-0 home loss to the No. 3 Florida State Seminoles. On the road UW has wins over Kentucky, Washington and Portland and is entering a four game homestand. Now in her sophomore campaign, Murtha has led the Badgers with six points on the season from two goals and four assists. Senior scored two game-winning goals, one early in the season against Marquette and an overtime winner against Portland. Five players have scored for UW and junior forward Dani Rhodes has yet to get started, only getting one assist on the season.Player to WatchJunior goalkeeper Jordyn Bloomer has stepped into the starting role as goalkeeper after Caitlyn Clem graduated last season. Clem was a two-year starter and was a solid force for Wisconsin back there. Last year, UW only allowed 18 goals last season. Bloomer has big shoes to fill and the Badgers have already let in six goals in the young season. With only one clean sheet, UW will hope to sure up their defense and Bloomer as the last line of defense will be a huge part of it. She has a save percentage of .647 on the year after facing 39 shots. Both the defense and Bloomer will have to step up to get back into the NCAA Tournament for the third-straight year.–Bremen KeaseyVolleyballLast YearThe preseason No. 7 team in the country, Wisconsin entered 2017 with typically high expectations despite the departure of four-time All-American Lauren Carlini. Buoyed by the performance of standout freshmen Sydney Hilley and Dana Rettke — the latter of whom was named the 2017 AVCA National Freshman of the Year — the Badgers rose as high as No. 5 in the rankings before a midseason slide during Big Ten play. Wisconsin steadied the ship entering the postseason and won their first two NCAA tournament matches, but were eliminated by Stanford in the Sweet 16 in four sets — the second consecutive year Wisconsin’s season ended at the hands of the Cardinal.This YearAnchored by Rettke and Hilley, along with former All-Americans Tionna Williams and Molly Haggerty, Wisconsin entered the year ranked No. 8 and has already exceeded expectations. After a quiet opening weekend in Minneapolis, the Badgers returned home for the HotelRED Invitational and quickly dispatched then-second-ranked Texas in four sets. The Cardinal and White received unexpected contributions from sophomore outside hitter Grace Loberg, who started only three matches last season but has stepped up with back-to-back career highs in kills in wins over Florida State and Texas. Loberg ended up earning Big Ten Player of the Week honors for her performance. UW starts a four-game road trip at the end of September with three straight games against top-20 opponents. If Wisconsin can make it through that stretch with at least three wins, they’ll be in good position to capture the conference crown. Back home, dates to circle will be a Halloween night matchup with current No. 1 Minnesota and an October 19th battle against No. 7 Nebraska. With six other Big Ten teams in the top 20 nationally, the Badgers will be tested early and often as they advance through conference play, but early indications are this could be a historic year for UW in the field house.Player to WatchA third-team All-American and Big Ten Freshman of the Year in her debut season, redshirt sophomore Molly Haggerty missed all of last year with a back injury that threatened to permanently derail her volleyball career. The Glen Ellyn, Ill. native is back in 2018, and if she can return to the form she showed early in 2016 — when she set a UW three-set record with 27 kills against Texas and was named the AVCA national player of the week — she has the talent to take the Badgers’ offense to the next level. An adept defensive player as well, Haggerty’s ability to play both in the frontcourt and backcourt gives Wisconsin the flexibility to put its best attackers on the court consistently, which will be crucial in matches against the country’s best teams.–Cameron Lane-Flehinger",Badgers set for interesting season across all fall sports,UWM

Wisconsin will be without its top two receivers for at least the first two games.Following his alleged involvement in the sexual assault charges against suspended wide receiver Quintez Cephus, sophomore Danny Davis has been suspended for the first two games of the Badgers’ season.Head coach Paul Chryst announced the decision a day after cancelling media availability to gather more information on the allegations made against the two wide receivers.“Based on the information I have available to me at this time, I have decided to suspend Danny Davis for the first two games of the season,” Chryst said. “Should further information become available that warrants a reevaluation of the length of the suspension, I will assess that information. We have a high standard of conduct within our football program and we cannot accept behavior that is not consistent with that standard.”A wide receiver group touted as one of Wisconsin’s best in recent memory now finds itself short of experience. Now, with the top two returning receivers out for games against Western Kentucky and New Mexico, the depth of the receiving core will be tested.Junior A.J. Taylor, who tallied 31 receptions for 475 yards and five touchdowns, and redshirt sophomore Kendric Pryor, who logged 13 receptions for 179 yards and one touchdown are the only two receivers on the roster with significant game experience and are expected to be pushed up to No. 1 and No. 2 on the depth chart in Cephus and Davis’s absence.Taylor and Pryor both increased their production last season during the five games Cephus missed with a broken leg. In those five games, Taylor recorded 17 catches for 244 yards and four touchdowns while Pryor totaled seven catches for 99 yards and three touchdowns, with two coming on the ground.Behind Taylor and Pryor, Chryst has a handful of young, inexperienced receivers. His options include freshmen Aron Cruickshank and Taj Mustapha and redshirt sophomores Adam Krumholz and Jack Dunn, none of whom have caught a pass with the Badgers.When asked about his wide receiver depth, the first two names Chryst mentioned were Krumholz and Dunn, both of whom are walk-ons.“Jack Dunn and Adam Krumholz have given themselves opportunities,” Chryst said. “And then you’ve got a young group that they’ve got to start coming out of the fog. Guys are here and we’ve got to help them grow and help this team.”Krumholz appeared in six games for the Badgers in 2017 while Dunn played in eight. Both got most of their work on special teams, and neither recorded a catch during limited reps at receiver.Cruickshank and Mustapha both enrolled early and participated in Wisconsin’s spring camp, flashing big play potential. Chryst acknowledged the biggest challenge facing the two freshman was learning the offense and knowing what to do on the field.“They know more now and are more comfortable now than they were in April,” Chryst said after practice Wednesday.Cruickshank in particular has impressed coaches throughout the spring and summer with his speed, athleticism and elusiveness.“Captain Obvious could’ve made that call,” Chryst said last spring after being asked if he was impressed with Cruickshank.Behind their loaded offensive line and star running back Jonathan Taylor, the Badgers should still breeze by Western Kentucky and New Mexico without Davis and Cephus, but having their top two receivers suspended a week before the first game is not how the Badgers envisioned starting their much-anticipated season. The Badgers are No. 4 in the preseason AP poll, their highest ranking since 2000.Chryst hopes to avoid letting this become a distraction for the team.“Certainly this is unique for this group,” Chryst said. “I do believe that throughout the season, you try to focus on the things that you can, not control, but impact, and I think our group has done a good job with that. I don’t think you ever go through a season without distractions …  There are always things you have to deal with, the players deal with it, and they help each other through it.” ","Following suspensions to top receivers, Badgers depth to be tested",UWM

They were not aware of his misconduct prior to hiring him.While at UWEC, two students filed similar complaints, which Wilson denied. He resigned in October 2017. Teresa O’Halloran, UWEC’s affirmative action officer and Title IX coordinator, found that he should be fired for his actions.“I believe that the prior behavior along with the sensitive issues and vulnerable students that Wilson’s job here involves increases the potential liability UW-Eau Claire would carry by continuing to employ Wilson,” O’Halloran said in the statement of her findings.Although revealing allegations and current statuses of investigations will be found within personnel files, investigation materials — like witness accounts — are not included. However, they can be used as evidence for Title IX investigations.The UW System is taking steps forward to achieve clear and concise terms for employee misconduct to avoid any hidden accusations when seeking to work in other UW institutions, Regent Vice President Drew Petersen revealed in the press release.The regents will vote on the hiring regulations Thursday, along with confirming to ask Gov. Scott Walker for $107 million in added state funds for the drafted 2019-’21 UW System budget.",UW System to ring in new year with more thorough hiring process,UWM

The receiver is facing charges of third-degree sexual assault and second-degree sexual assault of an intoxicated victim, both of which are felonies.According to the statement released by the Madison Police Department, officers initially met with a woman who had been taken to an emergency room and provided them with Cephus’s name and address. The officers later met with Cephus and obtained his statement, in which they learned the identity of a second woman who also said she had been sexually assaulted by Cephus in his apartment.According to the Wisconsin State Journal, sophomore receiver Danny Davis was also present for the incident but is not currently facing charges.Cephus has maintained his innocence and, in Saturday’s statement, called the incidents part of a “consensual relationship.”According to the athletic department’s policy, Cephus will be unable to participate in practices or games for the duration of his suspension, but can still access academic support, medical assistance and use team facilities, including the weight room.",Badgers receiver Cephus suspended from team for sexual assault charges,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/07/summer-2018-tv-preview,"July 2, 2018 | 12:00pm CDT","If you’re like me and see summer as an opportunity to watch as much television as you want, I’ve got you covered. I’ve listed the four shows I’m most anxiously waiting for so you don’t miss out.“13 Reasons Why” (out now on Netflix)This one is definitely the most controversial on my list. Last year, when Netflix dropped the first season of “13 Reasons Why,” the internet went insane. It was highly criticized for the way it dealt with suicide and became one of the most talked-about shows of the year. I’m not going to lie — I binged it all in a week and was a big fan of the book in middle school, so I know I’m going to be watching it as soon as possible. That said, I think all of the criticisms are very fair. If you’re uncomfortable with scenes of violence and sexual assault, it’s definitely a show you’ll want to avoid. Honestly, I’m half-excited for the drama that will ensue after the show poorly handles another serious topic — or perhaps I’ll be pleasantly surprised, that is if they learn from their mistakes.“Picnic at Hanging Rock” (out now on Amazon)If you don’t want to commit to an entire full season of a show, then you’re in luck because there are a few new mini-series this summer. The one on the top of my list is “Picnic at Hanging Rock,” an Australian drama following the mysterious disappearance of three schoolgirls and their governess in the year 1900 that Amazon has acquired the rights to. It stars “Game of Thrones” alum Natalie Dormer, so I’m already committed to tuning in. The costume design is amazing, which is something I enjoy the most about period pieces. It also has a murder mystery, so what more can you ask for?“Pose” (out now on FX)This is probably the show I’m most excited for, but also the one I’m most nervous about. Ryan Murphy is a legend and is starting up yet another FX original series. “Pose” is set in 1980s New York and brings us into the different lives of various New Yorkers, including the ball culture world. Because drag culture is so special, I always get nervous whenever it seeps into mainstream media, but Murphy is taking the weight of it seriously: The show features the largest cast of transgender actors in series-regular roles, as well as the largest recurring LGBTQ+ cast ever for a scripted U.S. TV series.""Sharp Objects"" (July 8 on HBO)Perhaps the only other thing that can match my excitement for “Pose” is my excitement for “Sharp Objects,” an HBO mini-series (which is music to my ears) adapted from a Gillian Flynn novel (who also wrote “Gone Girl”). Directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, who also directed “Big Little Lies,” and starring Amy Adams, it’s as if HBO peered into my brain and created the perfect summer show. I don’t think I have to hype it up any more than that, so make sure you don’t miss it.",?Summer 2018 TV Preview,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/06/cook-receives-three-years-in-prison-for-sex-crimes,"June 21, 2018 | 4:41pm CDT","Alec Cook, a former UW-Madison student convicted of sexual assault, was sentenced to three years in prison with an additional eight years of probation Thursday, far less than the maximum 40-year sentence sought by the prosecution.Cook was arrested in October 2016 after a female student accused him of sexually assaulting her in her apartment. He was later accused by 10 additional women, which lead to his expulsion from UW-Madison in March 2017.Cook plead guilty to five felonies, three counts of third-degree sexual assault and one count each of strangulation and stalking. He faced a maximum possible prison sentence of 19 years and six months followed by 20 years of extended supervision.In his sentencing hearing Thursday, the prosecution asked Dane County Circuit Judge Stephen Ehlke to give Cook the maximum sentence. Cook’s defense attorneys asked that Cook not be given any prison time, instead allowing him to seek professional treatment while on probation.Following the statements, Cook offered a tearful apology to the victims.“I’m sorry. I was wrong. You told the truth and everyone should believe you,” he said. “This is my fault. You didn’t deserve this and neither did your families. To them too, I’m sorry.”Judge Ehlke noted that first-time offenders that plead guilty like Cook do not typically receive prison time in similar cases. Despite this, Ehlke announced that Cook will have to serve three years in prison followed by five years of extended supervision and three additional years of probation.“The most important thing here today is that the victims’ voices be heard,” said Ehlke, who read statements from several of the victims.Cook will also have to register as a sex offender for 15 years following the completion of his term.Cook will not be allowed to have any contact with any of his victims and will not be allowed on any UW campus.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/06/to-prevent-selecting-sexual-harassers-uw-system-discusses-reshaping-hiring-processes,"June 1, 2018 | 5:20pm CDT","The UW System will look into reforming their hiring processes and reference checks in order to prevent prospective candidates with a history of sexual harassment from being considered during the hiring process.The proposal, as sought out by Gov. Scott Walker, includes policy changes that require all UW campuses to share personnel files of all current and future employees during the hiring review with one another. Furthermore, this would require all campuses to document any known investigations or allegations of sexual harassment.The proposal came after a report detailing a 2015 sexual assault of a local campus vendor employee by former UW-Stevens Point Assistant Dean Shawn Wilson. He now holds the same position at UW-Eau Claire after checks failed to produce incriminating evidence.The female employee accused Wilson of “asking her to go home with him and making sexual innuendos,” despite the fact they were both married and she repeatedly said no, according to the Stevens Point Journal. Wilson signed his resignation in October 2015, following the resolution of the university's investigation.During the investigation, Wilson was placed on paid leave and allowed to return with restrictions. These included being banned from where the vendor employee worked. His resignation officially took place in January 2016.The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel looked into allegations previously disclosed by UW System universities. They reported several campuses had incomplete personnel files or missing essential detailed records.The new system policy requires all personnel files to be appropriately written up at the end of allegations and investigations, including if they were found responsible, resigned or were penalized or fired.""The UW System has zero tolerance for sexual harassment,” UW System President Ray Cross told the MJS. “There is no room for compromise on that commitment. We will continue to work tirelessly to assess our policies and revise them as necessary to ensure that our campus communities are safe and welcoming places to live, learn and work.”The UW System previously modified their sexual assault and harassment policy in 2016 to place a formal responsibility on universities to remain committed to confronting the issue. This also included training sessions to aid in determining and preventing sexual harassment.The policy will be discussed in the upcoming Board of Regents meeting in early June.","To prevent selecting sexual harassers, UW System discusses reshaping hiring processes",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/05/milk-and-honey-is-an-honest-collection-of-poems-from-rupi-kaur,"May 26, 2018 | 4:53pm CDT","Poetry can be an acquired taste for some people, a type of love-hate relationship. I’m sure we all can recall those times in English class when we had to come up with haikus and other short poems that made no sense: You either got it or you didn’t.I was always the odd one who loved poetry and prided myself on understanding the deeper meanings some of the authors were trying to incorporate. As time went on, poetry took the back burner to my life. When I had spare time to explore the newest publications in literature, I usually stuck to novels.I can still remember when Rupi Kaur first wrote “milk and honey” in 2014. She gained mainstream popularity and became known as an “Instapoet,” or someone who publishes short verses or stanzas on social media. Its immediate success saw the poetry collection on The New York Times Best Seller list and resulted in the collection being reissued by Andrews McMeel Publishing in November 2015.Due to the universality of its themes, it appeals to readers everywhere and addresses issues that all women can relate to. I decided to read the book this past month, completely unprepared for what it was truly about.“milk and honey” is a self-published compilation of short poems which explore the raw emotions of human experience. Kaur’s collection of prose investigates a variety of themes, including love, loss, trauma, healing, femininity and migration.The titular name is a biblical reference to Exodus 33:3, where God promises to provide the Israelites a “land flowing with milk and honey.” As shown in the first poem, Kaur equates milk and honey to kindness: “how is it so easy for you/ to be kind to people” asks a man, with Kaur’s response as “cause people have/ not been kind to me.”The novel is stylized as “milk and honey,” incorporating Kaur’s culture through her writing style. She purposefully writes in lowercase as a way to honor her culture by paralleling Gurmukhi script. The style reveals an equality of letters that reflects her worldview and allows her work to be accessible.The book is split into four parts: “the hurting,” “the loving,” “the breaking” and “the healing.” Each chapter focuses on an individual theme, dealing with a type of pain and growing from that experience.Roughly every other page, there is a hand-drawn sketch by the author herself, representing the themes, characters and situations described in each poem. In some cases, the poems are written around or even within the sketches, forcing the reader to examine the interplay between text and image.The first chapter, “the hurting,” depicts events of sexual assault and rape. In these poems, a narrative begins to emerge: The speaker, like so many women before her, has been abused by her father, her uncle and various men in her life.“the hurting” primarily focuses on the speaker's experiences of abuse, offering insights and confessions as she reflects on the repercussions. The speaker recognizes that many other women in her family have been subjected to similar experiences and are taught to be subservient to men.Over time, she internalizes the lessons her father has taught her, repeating to herself, “i am nothing.” This abuse has lasting effects on her self-esteem, her relationship with her father and the way she perceives the world. Her love life is also haunted by her past sexual experiences. In the last poem of this chapter, the speaker says, “i flinch when you touch me/ i fear it is him.”The second chapter, “the loving,” is a shift in the novel which focuses on the speaker’s adult relationships with men. The opinion she has of herself and her body is irrevocably shaped by her father’s actions and words: “the closest thing to god on this earth/ is a woman's body,” because “it's where life comes from.”She carries this wisdom with her in her adult life, thinking of her body as a place of beauty, complication, longing and pain. She falls in love with a man she recognizes as “the type/ of man i'd want to raise my son to be like.”This new loving relationship has a profound effect on the speaker. She associates it with safety, taking comfort in the sound of his voice and the touch of his hands on her skin. The final poem in this section takes the form of a long prose to emphasize the underlying narrative of their relationship.“the breaking” is the third and longest chapter of the collection. It recounts the breakup with her boyfriend, who was mentioned in the previous chapter. Following this, Kaur focuses on the generality of relationships with men. In one poem she writes, “did you think I was a city.../ don’t come here with expectations/ and try to make a vacation out of me.”The speaker directs her pain by speaking out against the sexism and misogyny that teaches men to think of women as property. She refuses to be diminished, claiming she broke up with him because she was tired of feeling “anything less/ than whole.” The final poem in this chapter reads: “the way they/ leave/ tells you/ everything.”The collection ends on a more positive note, as the final chapter is titled “the healing.” A majority of the poems in this section consist of aphorisms — statements of general truths — like “do not bother holding onto/ that thing that does not want you” or “accept that you deserve more/ than painful love.”The aphorisms help the speaker to heal from the grief and trauma that was inflicted on her. The speaker realizes that healing is a process and can only be achieved when she looks within herself for the answers. She states: “i'm learning/ how to love him/ by loving myself.”The first step in the healing process is acknowledging the fact that one is broken. She is able to find strength in herself and in the fellowship of other women: “our struggle to/ celebrate each other is/ what’s proven most difficult/ in being human.” She understands that her experiences are not uncommon and that women must empower themselves to fight misogyny.The ending of this book is powerful and really resonates with the speaker when she thanks the man who “split [her] open,” because it forces her to write her story and find her true voice as a poet and as a human.Kaur’s poetry is written with such truth and emotion. The book teaches you that life is filled with terrible and heartbreaking moments, but within those moments you can find great things. There is so much meaning and emotion behind every word.As Kaur stated: “‘milk and honey’ takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.”This short collection reminded me of why I love poetry, and how it can really emulate the experiences of being human. It’s an uninhibited, passionate exposure of life in its natural state. As mentioned before, poetry is not for everyone, but I urge you to give Rupi Kaur’s words more than a cursory glance to see how it is so much more.",‘milk and honey’ is an honest collection of poems from Rupi Kaur,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/05/top-10-news-from-spring-2018,"May 10, 2018 | 8:00am CDT","As always, this semester was a busy one at UW-Madison. The Daily Cardinal's news team recaps 10 newsworthy moments that could have an effect on the future of the university, the city and the state.1. Meal plan controversy heats upUW-Madison’s new meal plan for incoming first-year students living in residence halls — revealed by The Daily Cardinal in late November — faced immediate backlash from UW-Madison students and community members.Many community members decried the plan as discriminatory for low-income students and those with religious dietary restrictions. This led to protests at Gordon Dining Hall and Four Lakes Market that aimed to show university officials that students were still “outraged” and wanted the plan eliminated.University officials claimed the plan, which requires students to deposit a minimum of $1,400 onto their WisCard to be used specifically for on-campus dining, would give both students and parents a better idea of what they would be spending on dining. It was soon revealed another goal of the plan was help “financially stabilize” the dining program by ensuring students spend a certain amount of money on dining.Student committees have since been created to communicate ideas for potential changes to the plan with Dining officials. Additionally, dining officials have altered the plan to allow students the option to opt out if they have religious or dietary restrictions.Still, students vow to continue to protest and oppose the meal plan until it is eliminated.-Lawrence Andrea2. Alec Cook pleads guiltyAlec Cook, the expelled former UW-Madison student, reached a plea deal in February, days before his first scheduled trial in Jefferson County. As a part of the deal, Cook pleaded guilty to five charges, including three counts of third degree sexual assault, one count of strangulation and suffocation and one count of stalking. All five charges spanned five separate incidents, including the first reported incident on Oct. 12, 2016.Cook was originally charged with 21 charges, 12 of which were sexual assault. Six of those 12 included use of force. Although those charges were thrown out, the judge can consider them at Cook’s sentencing for those he pleaded guilty to. His sentencing hearing will be June 21. -Max Bayer3. March for Our Lives in MadisonIn the wake of February’s mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., hundreds of UW-Madison students and community members joined thousands of Madison-area high schoolers at the steps of the Wisconsin State Capitol to get the attention of legislators and advocate for tighter gun laws as part of National Walkout Day.Amid chants of “Enough is enough” and “The NRA has got to go,” UW-Madison students shared stories about how gun violence had negatively impacted their lives. Student leaders from local high schools and elected officials, including state Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, and state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, spoke about the need for more stringent gun legislation.This student-led demonstration was just one step in the nation-wide effort to combat gun violence.-Lawrence Andrea4. Walker warns of ""Blue Wave""As Democrats hope to capitalize on anti-Trump backlash around the country entering the 2018 elections, several surprise victories in Wisconsin led Gov. Scott Walker to warn his party of a possibly impending “blue wave” in the state.In January, Democrat and political newcomer Patty Schachtner upset Republican state Rep. Adam Jarchow in a special election to replace Sheila Harsdorf in the state Senate, who was appointed as the state’s agriculture secretary. The district had remained in Republican hands for nearly two decades prior.After two more Republican lawmakers left their posts to join Walker’s administration, the governor refused to call special elections to replace them, causing many to speculate he feared further electoral losses.After a third judge ordered him to do so, a call for new elections was issued.Republican concerns over Democratic electoral momentum were only heightened after a contentious state Supreme Court election, in which the more liberal candidate, Rebecca Dallet, soundly beat her conservative rival, Michael Screnock.With almost a dozen incumbent Republican legislators retiring across the state, Walker is preparing his party for a potentially rough election year.-Andy Goldstein5. Bucky's Tuition Promise announcedIn an effort to boost educational access and inclusion for low-income students, UW-Madison will now provide free tuition and segregated fees to students from families making less than $56,000.Starting in fall 2018, Chancellor Rebecca Blank announced that the university will spend about $3.3 million annually to cover all eligible students.The promise comes without any additional state funding, and will be completely paid for by private gifts and existing institutional funding.About 800 incoming freshman are expected to be covered in each new class.“We know there’s a perception that UW-Madison is financially out of reach for some of our Wisconsin families, and we know this keeps some high school students in our state from applying here,” Blank said. “We don’t want this to be the case any longer. Going forward, we are removing the cost of tuition as a barrier for these families.”-Andy Goldstein6. University releases sexual harassment recordsInformation released to the public regarding sexual harassment at the university found that two teaching assistants in the sociology department allegedly sexually harassed students.One TA was put in a non-teaching role and will leave the university at the end of the academic year. There was already a sexual harassment case against the TA. In response, the department held a meeting with him in May 2017 to discuss his behavior, but ultimately placed him in a new role. But additional concerns arose in the fall, prompting the TA to leave at the end of the year.The other TA also had a history of inappropriate contact with students. He invited three females to a concert, sent another female text messages asking her out and forced an undergraduate woman to have sex with him, the records show. He has since graduated.UW-Madison released the documents after multiple news organizations made open records requests to the university about sexual harassment complaints and investigations at the university over the last decade.-Maggie Chandler7. Humanities majors threatened at UW-Stevens PointIn an effort to rectify a $4.5 million deficit, UW-Stevens Point announced a plan to cut 13 humanities majors earlier this semester.Spanish, history, political science and sociology were among the majors on the chopping block. While courses will still be taught in these departments, the university will see a significant cut in faculty.The plan, which would also shift funding to increased STEM programming, was met with backlash from students across the UW System. Joined by fellow UW System students, UW-Stevens Point students braved a snowstorm on April 18 to demonstrate in the regents’ office.However, not all students have been critical of the plan. The UW-Stevens Point College Republicans announced their support of the cuts, and the university, which cited decreased enrollment as a reason for the budget deficit, hopes the renewed emphasis on STEM courses will attract more students.The controversy surrounding the cuts has led UW System leaders to reconsider the original proposal, and commit to honoring shared governance when making final decisions on how to handle the UW-Stevens Point deficit.The plan has been criticized by several national organizations, many of which argue eliminating the humanities could be detrimental to students’ future career success.-Luisa de Vogel8. Paul Ryan announces retirementAfter representing Janesville for two decades, House Speaker Paul Ryan has announced he will not seek reelection in 2018.One of the most notable Wisconsin political figures for north of a decade, Ryan’s retirement poses new challenges to a party hoping to retain their congressional majority.Though the district has consistently voted for Republicans for years, Democrats have mounted a more energetic and well-financed challenge than they have in recent memory. Veteran and union ironworker Randy Bryce has raised multitudes more than past Ryan challengers, largely thanks to a nationally viral online Twitter presence.On the Republican side, several big names in state politics, including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, were floated out as potential replacements before publicly denying that they would run.-Andy Goldstein9. Campus confronts past ties to KKK After a university study group tasked with researching the history of UW-Madison student organizations previously affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan missed their Dec. 1 deadline to advise campus as how best to respond to this history, the group released their findings in early April.The group recommended that campus confront its past ties to the Klu Klux Klan by addressing struggles of current underrepresented students, giving Chancellor Blank recommendations to fund a campus history project to recover the histories of marginalized campus members, as well as to commit significant resources to campus divisions, programs and policies that benefit underrepresented students.The committee, however, did not issue a recommendation on whether to rename the Fredric March Play Circle and Porter Butts Gallery at the Union — both named after members of the 1920’s “Klu Klux Klan” student group. Students took issue with this.Just under a week after the recommendations were released, a group of UW-Madison students and alumni announced plans to file a hate and bias report against the university for its “inadequacy in renouncing the memorialization of the KKK on campus.”The same day students filed that report, the Union council met to outline an agenda to rename the spaces,, and also create more Wisconsin Union programing that confronts unexamined racial and religious bigotry on campus. In the meantime, the spaces’ names will be covered and they will simply be referred to as “The Gallery” and “Play Circle.”-Lawrence Andrea and Sydney Widell10. Confederate monuments in Madison cemetery to be removedAfter debate amongst city officials, city council votes to remove confederate monumentsOver the course of the winter semester, city committees discussed what should be done with two confederate monuments located at Forest Hill Cemetery. Their erection came under scrutiny after the protests in Charlottesville, Va. and in August of last year, the larger of the two monuments was vandalized. It was decided at that time that a more concrete decision needed to be made regarding their existence.Following a joint meeting between the three committees, the Landmarks, Parks and Equal Opportunities commissions each created their own recommendations for the monuments, many of which varied on whether to remove the monuments entirely or keep them and add an additional plaque that would properly explain the history of the monuments and why they were there. At their meeting on April 10, a proposal for such a plaque failed, the city council unanimously voted to remove the monuments.-Max Bayer  ",Get your top 10 news from the spring 2018 semester,UWM

Immediately, investigators began a meticulous process of sifting through the city’s many public surveillance cameras to try and identify a person of interest.First, one camera identified a car following the woman home. Then, a second camera identified the same vehicle in a Capitol-area parking lot, the footage of which included a license plate number. What followed was a swift cascade of events that included learning the suspect’s name, matching DNA left at the scene with information already obtained by the Wisconsin Crime Lab and apprehending the individual.At a press conference announcing the arrest, MPD chief Mike Koval praised the surveillance technology.“We’ve had the benefit of surveillance cameras that are out in public spaces are only looking at public spaces and they have been extremely instrumental to our ability to the jobs in this current contemporary form of policing,” he said.Koval added that there should be more cameras in high-density areas. As it stands, there areapproximately 875 cameras in Madison.The conversation about the use of public cameras is not new; however, as additional cameras are considered, the city has expanded its dialogue. Mayor Paul Soglin has established a work group while the Common Council has a five-member task force that’s assessing the practice.The council specifically is working to establish a concrete policy for the use of surveillance cameras and hear from city departments about how, if it at all, they use surveillance.In their current draft, surveillance technology includes “technology whose primary purpose is to observe or analyze the movements, behavior, or actions of identifiable individuals in a manner to raise concerns about civil liberties, freedom of speech or association, racial equity or social justice.”Ald. Ledell Zellers, District 2, sponsored additional dollars in the last budget to add 18 cameras into the downtown area. She is also a member of the council’s task force.“I think that this recent situation, really supports the benefits of having them,” she said. “There was a stranger assault last year too and cameras again were pivotal.”Zellers said her main concern is the possibility of cameras looking into people’s living areas. Koval said the police department does not and will not use the technology to be voyeuristic.“I’m not saying at all that I think people are misusing them but as we all know, standard operating procedures or rules or protocols aren’t always followed by everybody,” said Zeller, adding that she just wants to minimize instances of misuse.She says that for the most part, her constituents are supportive of the cameras for safety reasons. Deputy Mayor Enis Ragland says the mayor hasn’t heard of many concerns but that it’s important to assess the policy.“It’s always good to look at your policy and update it everyone so often,” he said. “And I know we haven’t looked at our policies in a while.”As it stands for the police department, any camera available is at their disposal.“There’s a plethora of cameras out there and we utilize any and all of them when we have a crime to solve,” said public information officer Joel DeSpain. He added that the department has identified areas where more cameras would be necessary.“We’ve emphasized to the mayor that there are key areas of the city where we haven’t had adequate surveillance cameras,” he said.Zellers said that as it pertains to public knowledge, surveillance cameras don’t need a “great, big publicity campaign,” as their locations are often obvious.Moving forward, Ragland said that the city is working to adapt and that they don’t intend on using surveillance just for the sake of it.“We want to be rational and responsible in how we use technology,” he said.","In front of the lens: After surveillance assists in swift arrest, the practice is at the forefront",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/04/300-sexual-assaults-reported-to-uw-madison-this-year-3-percent-investigated,"April 25, 2018 | 9:02pm CDT","Over 300 sexual assaults were reported to UW-Madison in 2017, according to data released Wednesday, and while the number was on par with last year, reports increased by just over 100 cases since 2015.University officials pointed to an increase in knowledge about the reporting process, not actual sexual assaults as the reason for last year’s jump. According to Director of the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards,Tonya Schmidt this years relatively stagnant numbers support this theory.Of the 318 cases reported only 11 were investigated. This disparity exists for a multitude of reasons, according to Schmidt.“One of the things that we need for us to do an investigation is for one the complainant to be willing to go forward in that process because we want to give them agency and choice in that and two [the assailant] has to be a UW-Madison student,” Schmidt said.Additionally, the assailant must be identifiable from the report. Respondents can remain unidentified either because they are unknown to the survivor or because the survivor chose to keep the assailant anonymous.92 percent of cases reported fell into one of these categories and 54 percent of cases were reported to a confidential resource where neither parties are identified.The UW-Madison Title IX Coordinator is responsible for reaching out to all identifiable complainants to both offer resources for survivors and inform them of their options in the reporting process.However, not all survivors want an investigation. Only 11 students out of the 23 reports had respondents who were both identified and were a UW-Madison student wanted to pursue an investigation.“Our Title IX Coordinator reaches out to a lot of people and they don’t respond and that’s completely fine, it just means they don’t want to talk about this any further,” Schmidt said.The 11 investigations resulted in one expulsion, two suspensions and one University Probation. One case is still in progress and six respondents were found not responsible based on a preponderance of the evidence.“If that investigating officer does not have enough information to find the student responsible at a preponderance level, first I want to say it does not mean we don’t believe the complainant, it means we just don’t have the information,” Schmidt said.","300 sexual assaults reported to UW-Madison this year, 3 percent investigated",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/04/an-overarching-look-at-madison-this-semester,"April 26, 2018 | 8:00am CDT","Madison students, community members march to ask: ‘Am I next?”On March 24, thousands of Madison-area students and community members surrounded the Capitol to make a statement: “Not one more.”The crowd, which was a part of the international March For Our Lives, had gathered to demand that lawmakers address the epidemic of gun violence — which plagues communities nationwide on a daily basis.“When I am in class and the door is left open, I sit in fear,” one student activist told the crowd.Yet lawmakers have done nothing to address the issue. And without persistent pressure, they will continue to sit idly by.To the student activists who have come together around this cause: You are the future. Continue to march. Continue the conversation about gun violence. Continue to stand up for what you believe in. Wherever you go, change will follow.Alec Cook plea deal a step in the right direction, but not the leap we needIn late February, former UW-Madison student Alec Cook took a plea deal, pleading guilty to five criminal charges: Three counts of third degree sexual assault, one count of strangulation and suffocation and one count of stalking. But as a result of the plea deal, 16 of Cook’s charges were dropped. This means the maximum sentencing Cook could face is a 39.5 year prison sentence, required registration as a sex offender and up to $95,000 in fines for these five charges.Yes, Cook’s plea deal is a step forward compared to the disgustingly unjust verdicts of other recent UW-Madison sexual assault cases, such as Nicholas Ralston, who received no jail time despite being found guilty of second degree sexual assault, and Nathan Friar, who was acquitted despite admitting to the crime in a text. Yes, when presented next to the cases that come before Cook’s, this plea deal appears miles ahead in a long-awaited path to justice. Yes, the plea deal is a relative positive when lengthy sexual assault trials can force survivors to relive their trauma and still provide ample opportunities time and time again for legal loopholes for rapists and assaultants to walk free. But as we move toward Cook’s sentencing, let’s remember the 16 charges that were dropped and ask ourselves: What’s so flawed in the plight for justice for sexual assault survivors that this, in a lot of ways, feel like a best-case scenario?The cases before this have set the lowest possible bar. In our celebration of one small step toward justice, we must not hold our standard of justice to the precedents set by a flawed and unfair system. This is a step in a right direction, but a drop in the bucket toward the reform of the larger structural issues that plague our justice system. Housing’s new dining plan is classist, threatens low-income studentsWhile UW Housing clunkily unveiled their new dining plan late last semester, they have still not ironed out the kinks in what is going to become standard for all incoming residents starting next semester. The meal plan requires all incoming students to deposit a minimum of $1,400 on their Wiscard, which can only be used at Dining locations.Since the plan was announced, students have rallied together to put a stop the the change. They claim that the updated meal plan puts an added financial burden on students who are already struggling to attend UW-Madison. With the cost of getting a higher education becoming steeper by the year, it is already a struggle for some students and families to even afford tuition. However, an additional $1,400 just to be able to eat is something that these families don’t need to be worrying about. It only makes the cost of attendance higher and creates another barrier for lower-income students and families to attend UW-Madison.After a string of Democratic victories and low approval ratings for Gov. Scott Walker, there is a growing concern among Wisconsin Republicans that they could lose their stronghold in the state legislature this upcoming election cycle. This potential “Blue Wave” indicates the frustration toward Republican leadership at both the federal and state levels; however, it should by no means be interpreted as a foregone conclusionFollowing the Supreme Court election in which the liberal nominee Rebecca Dallet decisively defeated conservative candidate Michael Screnock, Walker ominously warned Republicans of an impending “Blue Wave” in the coming midterms. According to the Wisconsin State Journal, Walker’s approval rating is around 43 percent, putting him in the bottom 10 of gubernatorial approval.Walker’s unpopularity and concern for the upcoming election has caused him to prevent multiple special elections. While some may consider this abuse of power to not be a huge deal for Democrats, given the short amount of time these hypothetical winners would have had in office, it still indicates the widespread anxiety Republicans face, and the anti-democratic measures they are taking in the meantime.After 2016, it is clear that political favorites, especially in Wisconsin, are still susceptible to upsets. Those excited at the prospect of unseating Walker and his fellow Republicans this fall must continue to capitalize on the current momentum while not growing complacent. In doing so, Wisconsin can powerfully express its discontent with Republican leadership that has spent recklessly, ignored calls for gun safety, degraded the environment and deprioritized college education.Finance committee’s attendance debates wasted time and student moneyIn the past semester, the Student Services Finance Committee has allocated a good share of money to student groups on campus seeking funds for their activities.At the same time, however, members debated an absence policy for an hour that they eventually shot down, discussed other attendance issues and internal problems during several meetings and held a full session in which an impeachment process for six representatives resulted in no one being removed from their post.Students should take no issue with their finance committee taking the time to figure out how to equally serve groups from all backgrounds. But they should take issue with instances where those representatives, selected to fairly distribute segregated fees, instead use paid meeting time to talk about which of their absences should be excused.It doesn’t matter whether students are paying half a penny or half a million pennies for SSFC’s time. Representatives should not spend it on longer-than-necessary discussions about their own attendance policy — especially not to answer questions about why one member couldn’t be in two places at once to show up for a meeting.When voting on next year’s student government representatives, students should seek out a candidate who’s accountable to the responsible use of time and millions of dollars of student funding.Soglin, City right to remove Confederate monuments In mid-April, after months of contentious debate, Madison’s Common Council ordered the removal of two monuments honoring Confederate soldiers buried on Madison’s west side. The decision to do so was justified as the Confederacy fought to maintain slavery and white supremacy in the United States — a part of America’s history that should not be honored or commemorated.The first monument was erected in 1906 and lists the names of the 140 Confederate soldiers buried in Madison’s Forest Hill Cemetery. The other monument was erected in 1981 to offer an explanation for the larger monument and labeled Confederate soldiers as “valient” and “unsung heroes.”Several city alders voiced their displeasure with the monument's presence, with many labeling them as offensive to Madison’s African-American community, but those upset with their initial presence should be pleased with their forthcoming removal. Despite remaining hurdles, System reorganization just makes senseThousands of students, faculty and administrators are watching closely as the UW System juggles implementing a planned re-organization of its two-year and four-year universities.The plan, which would bring 13 two-year UW Colleges under the auspices of seven four-year universities, has met opposition from critics of UW System President Ray Cross. But the restructuring plan is similar to a model in Georgia, where graduation rates at the two-year schools involved doubled in a just over a year.Turbulence has been the norm for UW Colleges in recent years. Budgets have been trimmed, faculty cut and the student experience has taken a hit. Restructuring would allow two-year and four-year schools to share resources and help reverse a 32 percent enrollment drop by providing an easier path for students to transfer to a four-year school.But questions remain about the plan. UW Colleges Chancellor Cathy Sandeen told The Daily Cardinal the plan will need more time than initially thought to implement. It is important that administrators not rush the execution, lest they disrupt the college career of scores of students. But, if done correctly, this plan should be a benefit for all involved.University transparent, honest in sharing sexual harassment recordsThe university recently released sexual harassment records after several news organizations made requests about sexual harassment claims at the university from the past ten years.According to the the documents, more than $500,000 was given out by the university to settle sexual harassment and misconduct claims against employees over the past 10 years. Recently, a sociology teaching assistant was placed in a non-teaching role and will leave the university at the end of the year following reports from last fall 2017 about his harassment.The university is setting the right example by releasing these documents, and other universities should follow their lead. Notably, UW-Milwaukee has failed to release their sexual harassment documents, despite numerous requests from media outlets to do so.In the wake of the #MeToo movement, many women have been outspoken about harassment and inappropriate behavior from men and those in positions of power. While the university needs to keep taking steps toward creating a safe environment to learn and work, releasing these documents is a step in the right direction in showing support for those who have been victims of sexual harassment and abuse.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/04/mpd-arrests-suspect-in-stranger-sexual-assault-chief-hails-surveillance-as-the-key,"April 19, 2018 | 6:00pm CDT","Madison police arrested a suspect Thursday connected to the sexual assault of a 24-year-old on East Johnson Street that occurred earlier this month.The suspect, 28-year-old Dorian Wade, was arrested inside an apartment on Flower Lane on the city’s west side. After failing to persuade the suspect to leave the property and surrender to authorities, a SWAT unit pushed in the door and arrested Wade without incident. No shots were fired during the arrest.The sexual assault occurred in the early morning of April 7 when a woman, who police identified as a graduate student at UW-Madison, was walking home from the downtown area when a stranger pushed her into nearby bushes and assaulted her. A car pulled in close to where the crime occurred, which caused the suspect to flee.Madison Police Chief Mike Koval credited city surveillance cameras as the main reason why the department was able to locate a person of interest so quickly.“But for surveillance cameras put out in public spaces, we wouldn’t be having this conversation here today,” Koval said.Koval acknowledged the use of public surveillance has drawn criticism and members of the city fear that their privacy will be infringed. However, he said the use of the tactic is not for “voyeurism” or “invasions of privacy.”“They’re going to be used as they were intended to be used from our standpoint as a critical tool in a modern-day era where any public place, any public space, is subject to our monitoring and it’s for these reasons that I’m here taking on this part of the investigation,” he said.The downtown cameras provided evidence of a car following the victim home the night of the crime and by combining that footage with images of cars located in downtown-area parking garages, investigators were able to identify a license plate number of the vehicle.Through that research, officials managed to find a name and image of the suspect, who became a person of interest. By working with the Wisconsin State Crime Laboratory, DNA found at the scene of the crime was compared to DNA of the suspect already on file and a match was found.Wade has been arrested numerous times prior to Thursday for crimes including theft, operating a vehicle while impaired and driving on a revoked license.He was a member of the department’s focused deterrence program, which is overseen by the city’s Special Investigations Unit. The program provides individuals who commit a disproportionate amount of crime support, such as housing and job training so that they may be able to discontinue their behavior.The catch, Koval said, is if the individual continues to commit crimes, it will be recommended that prosecutors will seek the highest penalty process in court.“We have an insidious crime of the worst kind when you’re talking about sexual assault and the community is put at great fear, particularly in those instances where there is a stranger sexual assault,” Koval said.He added that those crimes send a riptide through the community.As for the future of surveillance in Madison, Koval believes this is evidence the city needs to invest more in the practice.“I think that those who are constantly assailing the sense of privacy issues have to understand that this is a brave new world we’re in,” he said. “The terms of engagement are such that what you do, how you comport yourself in public, has never been protected by the Fourth Amendment.”","MPD arrests suspect in stranger sexual assault, chief hails surveillance as the key",UWM

She said rape serves as a form of oppression in society because minority groups are often those who are the victims of sexual violence.“People who are the most vulnerable are intentionally targeted,” Wanjuki said. “It’s not accidental. It’s done because it’s a reflection of whose bodies are valued in society and whose we really care about.”She added people should take into account those with intersecting identities when trying to erase and fight rape culture. Wanjuki emphasized that meeting the needs of marginalized communities is crucial to ensuring a just society and that everyone should show support for victims of sexual assault.“The rapists know who’s not valued in our society, but we need to prove them wrong,” Wanjuki said. “This is not how it should be. We need to show that we do value all these lives.”","Blogger, writer talks fighting rape culture, sexual assault in divided political climate",UWM

UWM? We asked for those in November, and we are still waiting. pic.twitter.com/ys0qc2jwRuTalis Shelbourne, a student journalist for Media Milwaukee, said the group sent out an initial open records request to the administration on Nov. 17, requesting sexual misconduct complaints against faculty and staff in 2014 and 2015. The group later expanded the request in December to include information dating back to 2013.Shelbourne said Media Milwaukee still had not received a “formal response” from the university but received an email that said the university was “working on it.”Michelle Johnson, UW-Milwaukee’s senior director of integrated marketing and communications, said the public records custodian provided Media Milwaukee with some of the requests.In an article from late 2017, Media Milwaukee claimed that documents released by UWM provided the outcomes of the cases but did not provide any names or details that Media Milwaukee was looking for.Media Milwaukee reported that little was known about the cases because “the university has yet to comply with an open records request seeking details.” The Media Milwaukee article was updated three weeks later when the university responded to a different request specifically about sexual assault/harassment charges that led to a monetary settlement:“We have confirmed that the only sexual assault/harassment settlement from 2004 to present is the one (the UW) System reported,” the university responded. “It was in 2010 for $10,000. The respondent no longer works at UWM.”UW-Milwaukee responded to at least one open records request, but there are still pending requests that have been out for up to five months, Shelbourne said.Johnson said that UWM only has one records custodian, and she received 540 records request last year. Some of the requests require a “somewhat lengthy process of notice” to people named in the documents and allow them to object to release of the records.Shelbourne said that there has been “no miscommunication” with UWM faculty for the records request and said Media Milwaukee offered to take documents that had redactions in them.Shelbourne said though they understand it takes time for the records request, she hopes that UW-Madison releasing similar files about sexual misconduct against faculty and staff on April 9 will spur movement from UWM.UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone did not compare the response times between UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee for open request records. Johnson added that there are “significant differences between campuses” that would make it difficult to easily compare the release of records requests. For example, UW-Madison’s public records custodian does not handle police records, while the UW-Milwaukee public records custodian does, including requests for body camera footage.Media Milwaukee already has filed a court action against UWM for a document relating to a professor that the administration refused to provide because it contains attorney-client privilege information.They also filed a complaint against the Milwaukee Police Department pending with the State’s Attorney General’s office for withholding a police report with a sexual assault allegation against a professor, Shelbourne said.While Shelbourne is hoping that UW-Madison's response to the open records request encourages the administration at UWM, Media Milwaukee is ready to take action.“We are planning on giving them some more time to fulfill the requests but will also exercise our rights under open records laws, if necessary,” Shelbourne said.As for the tweet, Shelbourne said the group wanted to have a laugh about the situation.“We made the meme because we found it pretty amusing, but it is indicative of the fact that we have been waiting for quite a while,” Shelbourne said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/04/the-incredible-and-sad-tale-of-innocent-erendira-and-her-heartless-grandmother-is-an-unusual-beautiful-novella,"April 11, 2018 | 6:00am CDT","“The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Eréndira and Her Heartless Grandmother” is a 1972 magical realist novella written by Gabriel García Márquez. At about 20 pages, it’s a short, yet dense read.The genre of magical realism sprouted from Latin America in the early 20th century and was soon recognized as a distinct literary and artistic phenomenon. Magical realist literature can be described as a juxtaposition of the uncanny or unexplainable with the mundanity of everyday life.The plot is centered around Eréndira, a young girl who seems to be hopelessly enslaved by her whale-like grandmother. The two live alone in a large, dilapidated mansion in the middle of a desert.One night, however, “the wind of her misfortune begins to blow,” and Eréndira falls asleep, having forgotten to blow out the candle on her nightstand. During the night, a wind sweeps through her window and knocks over the candle, setting the mansion ablaze and burning it to the ground. The imagery of the wind follows Eréndira along her journey, usually heralding an impending life change.Eréndira’s grandmother tells her granddaughter that she must pay off the debt for inadvertently burning the house down, which will take her nearly 10 years to do. The Grandmother — as the text regularly refers to her as — seems to have some uncanny power over Eréndira, who does not refuse.Eréndira and The Grandmother, who carries a mysterious suitcase of their relatives’ bones, set off into the desert, where the latter hatches a wicked business plan. She forces her granddaughter to become a sex slave, setting up a tent and picking up stragglers to create a procession that travels from village to village.The story’s folktale magic and supernatural quality serve as a way to write about a disturbing subject that might otherwise be unreadable. The continual rapes of Eréndira are shrouded under the guise of the fantastical setting and beautiful language, but they’re still ever present in the reader’s mind.As this conflict goes on, Eréndira seems to accept her fate, which angers the reader and makes for a page-turning story. Although she appears so passive, there is a sense of power in her character that the reader yearns to see clearly.There is no question the readers are rooting for Eréndira to break free from her grandmother’s clutches. However, we are reminded that in the real world, victims of sexual assault are often ignored or shamed.Realistically, the men in the story remain nameless, and they never have to take any of the blame for Eréndira’s suffering.For the remainder of the novella, the reader questions whether she will finally stand up to the evils in her life or forever be trapped in the desert, using her body to pay off the debt to her villainous grandmother.“The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Eréndira and Her Heartless Grandmother” is an unusual and rewarding read with beautiful language and imagery, along with heavy real world significance.I definitely suggest reading it here or at a library: You’ll never know the fate of Eréndira unless you do!Final Grade: B+","‘The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Eréndira and Her Heartless Grandmother’ is an unusual, beautiful novella",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/04/sociology-department-ta-placed-in-non-teaching-role-after-sexual-harassment-allegations,"April 9, 2018 | 7:54pm CDT","A teaching assistant in the Sociology Department has been put in a non-teaching role and will leave the university at the end of the academic year after additional concerns about their conduct — following a sexual harassment case — arose again this fall.These emails come after multiple news organizations sought information on complaints and investigations of sexual harassment at the university in the last 10 years via open records request. The university released those files to the public Monday along with a blog post from Chancellor Rebecca Blank addressed to the campus community.In the case involving the now non-teaching TA, the department held a meeting with him in May 2017 to talk about his behavior but ultimately “took action outside of the formal disciplinary process” and placed him in the new role, UW Spokesperson Meredith McGlone said.An email from September 12, 2017, from an anonymous sender claimed they knew three other people who the TA discovered on Tinder and that he “messaged them non stop with inappropriate messages to the point where they had to block him from the app to make him stop.”“Every single person who mentions his name is, “I know someone else he has sent inappropriate messages to.” and he’s sent these messages to me, too,” the email said. “You can’t deny this is a pattern that will continue to happen over and over again. I am angry, concerned and appalled that he is still TAing. HE IS PREYING ON YOUNG WOMEN AND IS A PREDATOR.”McGlone said the university responded to all of the people who came forward with concerns and offered to investigate but they declined.In another email from July 17, 2017, the anonymous sender said their co-worker sent information to the Dean of Students Office but didn’t receive a response. The sender added that another co-worker of theirs said they were a victim.“This man is a sexual predator and has made MULTIPLE unwanted advances toward FRESHMEN girls. even myself, he has “snap chatted” and asked me at 2-3am to Come over to his home,” the email said. “After myself even making it clear i wasn’t interested, he continued to chat me at early hours in the morning to come over to his home.”McGlone clarified that the co-worker did get a response from the Title IX Coordinator, adding that the Dean of Students Office referred the case to the coordinator as is standard practice.""It's likely that the anonymous sender and/or the co-worker simply may not have realized that that's how such complaints are handled,"" McGlone said.This is only the more recent of two cases.There was another case against a different Sociology TA, who has since graduated. The victim’s parent called Howie Stensrud, case manager in the Division of Student Life, the documents show.The student said she was getting text messages from the Sociology TA after the term ended asking her out. She did not have contact with the TA during the semester.“In discussion with the department chair of sociology it was revealed that this is a pattern and not the first time there has been a concern with XXX in regards to inappropriate contact with students in courses he was an instructor in,” Stensrud said in his report in 2016.The same TA was also reported again in a Campus Incident Reporting Form in April 2017. According to documentation, an undergraduate woman said that in an earlier semester he forced her to have sex with him.“After this, he would say “weird things” in class and then look at her, making her uncomfortable,” the report states. “It appears that ultimately, XXX made her grade contingent upon having sex with him.”A letter of reprimand from Pamela Oliver, Conway-Bascom Professor and chair of the department, was sent to the TA in June 2015 after he invited three female students via email to a concert. The correspondence stated that Oliver felt that it was “an isolated incident that does not represent a hostile environment problem.”“From speaking with you, I believe that you now understand why your actions were problematic and that you will not repeat them,” the letter stated. “I do need to warn you that if there is any recurrence of any action that could be construed as sexual harassment or violations of other campus policies, we will be unable to employ you as any instructional capacity in the future.”The 20 cases from the last decade had varying results, Blank said in her post Monday. While in some cases investigators found there wasn’t enough evidence of a violation, in other instances perpetrators were found responsible and “faced action up to and including termination.”As a result, departments provided more training for faculty, staff and students at a systematic level, according to the blog post. Blank said that the number of sexual harassment complaints and investigations will only increase as the university strengthens its efforts.“Title IX Responsible Employees” — those who inform the coordinator about sexual misconduct reports — will receive more mandatory training this summer, she said. UW System faculty and staff will also only receive a two percent wage bump if they finished their sexual harassment prevention training, among other requirements.Blank’s comments come after UW-Madison saw an increase of over 100 sexual assault reports, a university official said in March.The number of sexual assaults reported to a campus resource rose from 217 reports in 2015 to 325 in 2016. This more than doubles the increase between 2014 and 2015, when the number of reports rose by only 45.In January, the UW System and UW-Madison released records showing that across the UW System, about 100 complaints of employee sexual harassment and assaults were formally investigated since 2014.With the exception of UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee, over half of the complaints filed claimed professors sexually harassed students. But according to UW System spokesperson Stephanie Marquis, there were “a number of cases” where no violation was found.Still, Blank said she was optimistic about the progress the university has made and emphasized that students can get the help they need.“Here at UW, our efforts to combat sexual harassment began before the issue made headlines and I assure you they will continue,” Blank said. “I am encouraged by the momentum we are seeing and deeply appreciate the efforts of the students, staff and faculty who are committed to helping our campus move forward on this issue.”Nina Bertelsen contributed to this report.

Currently the university offers a seperate online reporting process available outside of business hours.“Callisto works within the existing structure of a reporting system. It just makes it more efficient and it makes the experience more accessible and empowering for survivors,” said Petra Dai, a student working with administration in an effort to implement Callisto.Callisto also has a “matching” system which can identify if more than one student reports the same assailant.“Because 90 percent of perpetrators of assault are repeat perpetrators, this unique platform gives students the ability to send their report only if another student reports the same assailant,” Dai said. “Many survivors feel an obligation and/or sense of community with other survivors, and this allows them to, if they feel right doing so, support their community and themselves.”Callisto has been implemented in 13 institutions across the country, such as the University of Denver and Stanford University, according to Dai.According to Callisto’s 2016-2017 report, survivors who visited the platform were five times more likely to report their experience than those who did not.Moreover, the survey reports that 97 percent of sexual assault survivors who visited Callisto would recommend it to a friend who was sexually assaulted.The university is currently deciding whether or not to implement Callisto on campus, and the administration is reaching out to experts to determine the implications of the new system.“UW–Madison has been evaluating the product and seeking feedback from students, survivors of sexual violence and campus staff who work in areas such as Title IX enforcement and student misconduct,” said UW-Madison Spokesperson Meredith McGlone.UW-Madison administration is meeting and will make a decision on whether or not to adopt Callisto within the next few weeks, according to Dai.“Regardless of how they report, or if they choose to report at all, all survivors receive information about support services, protective measures and accommodations that the university can provide. These include changes in academic, living, transportation and working situations,” said McGlone.","UW-Madison considers new, inclusive sexual assault reporting technology",UWM

She focused on the UGotThis! program and an in-person 90-minute dialogue aimed at preventing sexual violence in first-year communities.Along with student-focused initiatives, Johnson said, “we [UHS] do a lot of heavy messaging to parents before students get to campus, providing them information on preventing at-risk drinking, violence, and sexual assault.”Mary Eldridge, UHS victim advocate and survivor services coordinator, explained how students can reach out to UW staff to report sexual assault through both email and appointments.“We try to figure out how they can get their needs met,” Eldridge said.Eldridge also discussed the tools her team provides to sexual assault survivors.“We can reach out to professors and ask for accommodation,”she said, in addition to reporting the assault to police if necessary.Sexual assault survivors can also reach out to the campus’ Title IX coordinator, Lauren Hasselbacher, to get the resources they need. Hasselbacher described the process her team used when a student tells them they were assaulted.“My first step is to reach out to resources, and sometimes that outreach is all that the student is looking for,” she said.In terms of serious sexual assault complaints, the Title IX coordinator can initiate an investigation and provide a no-contact directive.“One of the primary resources my office provides is the no contact directive. We can prohibit unnecessary social contacts and that is requested fairly often from students,” said Hasselbacher.Another prevention service that UW-Madison is considering implementing is Callisto, an online platform that would exist on school websites where students can record the assault for their own needs and report it to a director if necessary.The goal of the website is to empower students to report the assault whenever they feel comfortable, as they can do it at any time of day.“We want to make sure that anyone who is experiencing misconduct is aware of what’s available on campus,” Hasselbacher said.",ASM panel aims to make sexual assault reporting process more transparent,UWM

Scott Walker signed legislation Tuesday prohibiting state health insurance plans’ coverage of abortions, handing state employees an uphill battle in terms of accessing the service.Along with a slew of 64 other measures, Walker privately signed the bill which allows abortion coverage only under cases of rape, incest or medical necessity, clarifying the ambiguity of similar conditions concurrently written in the state’s health insurance plan.Pro-life groups were quick to praise the legislation for further separating taxpayer funds and abortion services.“Government must not force us to participate in the killing of our preborn brothers and sisters with our state tax dollars,” said Dan Miller, the director of Pro-Life Wisconsin.State Sen. David Craig, R-Town of Vernon, a lead sponsor of the bill, noted during legislative debates that the measure would not keep women from getting abortions but merely alter who pays for them.Meanwhile, pro-choice advocates criticized the bill as a means for Republicans to circumnavigate outwardly outlawing abortion by further restricting access financially.“It is designed to steer a patient to continue a pregnancy rather than allowing the pregnant person to make the best health care decision,” said Elizabeth Nash, state policy expert for the Guttmacher Institute.State Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, argued that the measure would harm public workers who are victims of sexual assault and seeking abortion coverage by requiring them to report their assaults to police, a choice which many victims try to avoid.""Leave these decisions to the physicians and families who are suffering,” Taylor said.",Walker nixes abortion coverage for state workers under new law,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/03/uw-madison-womens-health-class-celebrates-50th-birthday-this-semester,"March 22, 2018 | 12:00pm CDT","In 1968, the feminist movement was the leading force in introducing the Gender & Women’s Studies class “Women and Their Bodies in Health and Disease” into UW-Madison’s curriculum. Fifty years later, the class has become imperative to the department, according to Professor Jenny Higgins.The class offers an introduction to health, ill health and the social influences and inequities that mold the female-assigned health systems. It creates a dialogue about contraceptive services, defines consent and provides information on menstruation and pregnancy, according to Kendall Oehler, a UW-Madison student.Oehler said the class taught her things she “deserved to know as a developing young person,” something she did not learn growing up in Stevens Point.“I considered it to be the sex ed I never had,” Oehler said. “It’s incredibly comprehensive in a way that high school sex ed class is not.”The class also offers a discussion on contraception and consent on a campus-wide scale while also giving students the opportunity to decide what that means for them. Oehler said this is essential to navigate the sexual climate on campus.“It really went in [on contraception], in a way that made it much easier to personalize my own healthcare experience for myself and gave me a sense of agency that I don’t think I otherwise would have had,” Oehler said.Higgins addressed the success of the class on campus, saying the internet has played a major role in the increasing number of students enrolled in the class — currently clocking in at 235.""Even with the rise of the internet, students are as hungry as ever for accurate, evidence-based information about their bodies and health,” Higgins said. “Most school-based sexuality education programs leave young people with insufficient information about these topics. Moreover, the field of healthcare changes rapidly, and so students are eager for the latest updates.”While the class is considered fundamental to the UW-Madison campus, current federal legislation is turning away from creating a safe and open environment for sex, consent and menstruation to be discussed, according to Oehler.Oehler said much legislation in the country restricts access to “basic fundamental rights.”“There’s kind of an attack on women and reproductive healthcare,” Oehler said. “Right now the current political climate is very hostile to that kind of empowerment.”The class has changed in the last 50 years to modernize the curriculum and match the current social and moral environments of today. Although she took the class last semester, Oehler believes that the class has changed significantly from the values of the mid-twentieth century.“It probably wouldn’t have taken the angle that it’s taking now, being biological and social and acknowledging all the power structures at play,” she said. “The idea of supremacy or hierarchy is one that might have been more suppressed in the 1950s.”Nina Valeo Cooke, director of Undergraduate & Curricular Services of Gender & Women's Studies and LGBTQ+ Studies, discussed curriculum shifts throughout the past 50 years, highlighting the growing developments in technology and the changing boundaries of sexuality.Cooke said developments in science and technology, as well as policy changes that influence health, have had the largest impact on the course. Cooke emphasized that the way we think of bodies, gender and identity — beyond a male-female binary — has changed dramatically.Gender & Women’s Studies 103 has become more relevant to international movements like Time’s Up and Me Too, responses to sexual harassment and assault in the entertainment industry and to individuals around the world, according to Higgins.""It's been incredible to witness these last couple of years: students have been galvanized, I think, that their voices DO make a difference,” Higgins said in an email. “The GWS 103 framework is aligned with a number of current social movements, from the Me Too movement to the fight for racial justice to immigrants' rights.”Oehler said this knowledge can and should be extended beyond the borders of campus through the use of social media and face-to-face conversation.“If each person has knowledge, they can transfer their knowledge to people that they come in contact with,” Oehler said. “I’ve had so many conversations with friends and family where I’ve been able to come to the table with a more educated perspective, and I think that’s enriched the conversation. It’s transferable, and that’s good for the world.”",UW-Madison women’s health class celebrates 50th birthday this semester,UWM

She has been undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer and has a positive prognosis.In a Wednesday blog post announcing her retirement, Berquam said her experience with cancer has taught her that life is short and the importance of following her dreams. Berquam shared that her cancer treatment will end in April, adding that she plans to visit Peru and climb Machu Picchu in July before heading to Florence, Italy to race a dragon boat with other breast cancer survivors.“The experience has given me so much perspective and I’m grateful for the support and kindness that has helped me persevere,” she said. “What I’ve learned this past year is that there is so much to look forward to and so much life to live and I plan to take full advantage of every opportunity.”Berquam said she has been exploring the fellowship through the American Council on Education for about a year, around the same time she was diagnosed with cancer. She will be assigned to a senior role at a new campus as part of the program’s leadership development component.While Berquam said this move is “a natural next step, both professionally and personally,” she added that it will be hard to leave the UW-Madison community.“My time in the Division of Student Life has been incredibly rewarding,” Berquam said. “Our students are amazing people and I’ve been inspired by them.

However, the rest of Council either is elected or appointed by the Nominations Board, the group that nominates ASM members for leadership positions.When motioning for a postponement, Rep. Ethan Carpenter said he would draft “a comprehensive amendment” that would be written ahead of the next Council meeting to alleviate these issues.Since the legislation looks to amend the Associated Students of Madison bylaws, it requires two votes. With tonight’s postponement, two votes are still needed. But ASM Chair Katrina Morrison pointed out that the measure could still be approved this session, as the committee still has two remaining meetings.As the legislation is written, the first-year liaison could attend meetings, sponsor and amend legislation, but will not be able to vote. Currently, these students can’t sit on Student Council unless they fill a vacancy through Nominations Board.That’s because in September, Student Judiciary — ASM’s judicial branch — made a decision to eliminate the four freshmen representative seats, which were redistributed to the Business, Engineering, Graduate and Special schools. The reapportionment happens every four years and is based on the number of students in each school or college, which can fluctuate.“[Freshmen representatives] were a special status not given to incoming graduate students, transfer students or any other student population that was new to the university,” Chief Justice William Olson said at the time. “We reached the consensus that with reapportionment we should aim to provide equal voice to all students and not create special classes among the student body.”In February, ASM shot down a proposal that called for a reevaluation of Student Judiciary’s decision. The legislation, put together by Reps. Dylan Resch and Mianzhi Huang, “condemns Student Judiciary’s decision to eliminate Freshmen Representative Seats.”Resch said that eliminating first year representative seats could hinder recruitment, as fewer students are able to engage with student government early on in their college careers.In past meetings, Resch has pointed to a big difference in voter turnout for ASM elections. While only nine percent of the entire student body voted in the the spring 2017 elections, 29 percent of the freshman class did in fall 2017.Additionally, he has argued online programs for drinking, sexual assault and diversity turn over quickly, meaning that older students quickly become out of touch with what it’s like to be new to campus.",Student Council seeks clarification on proposal to form first year committee; postpones vote,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/03/the-nightmare-on-devos-street,"March 19, 2018 | 8:00am CDT","Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ recent appearance on 60 Minutes made it hard to distinguish between reality and a Saturday Night Live skit. DeVos seems to be lost throughout the entirety of the interview, continuously stumbling over her words as she desperately attempts to portray herself as knowledgeable about the nation’s school systems, failing miserably and hoping to mask her ignorance with a smile. DeVos’ presence during the 60 minutes is frighteningly similar to how Kate McKinnon of SNL portrayed her, but that imitation was a parody meant solely for entertainment. This, disastrously, is the real Betsy DeVos, the real Secretary of Education, and she is just as embarrassing as her SNL counterpart.Perhaps the most bizzare part of this rollercoaster of an interview is when DeVos outrightly admits her incompetence as a public servant. When asked by 60 Minutes host Lesley Stahl if she had visited the “really bad schools,” DeVos resembles a deer caught in the headlights. Regaining her senses (kind of), DeVos confesses that she has not “intentionally visited the schools that are underperforming.” Most people would correctly assume that a large part of DeVos’ job as Secretary of Education would be to visit underperforming schools, seeing as her department’s official mission is to “improve the quality of education.” Pretty much any other response to Stahl’s question would’ve been better.But of course, DeVos was not hired on the basis of a glowing resume involving extensive expertise in the field of education, mainly because her only notable, education-related accomplishment is her stealthy involvement in an annual $1 billion worth of Michigan taxpayer money being poured into charter schools that lack proper regulations pertaining to education standards. She doesn’t have experience in education, but she does have a lot of money, a decent chunk of which she has donated to conservative organizations. In addition to her less-than-stellar resume, she has demonstrated a yearning to privatize education and implement religion throughout the nation’s school systems, curiously falling in line with the ideology of far-right evangelicals, many of whom are are unable to afford private, religiously-based educations for their own children. But, Christianity is supposedly involved in DeVos’ plan, so they support it blindly, even if it goes against their own interests.It seems there is some sort of sickeningly unjust, psychological cycle in place. The conservative poor are unable to afford adequate educations, and consequently make uninformed decisions. This leaves them to rely solely on their religious values and the empty words of those who claim to uphold them, such as the superficial, misleading rhetoric of Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos. It is clear that DeVos and the rest of the Trump administration want to maintain and protect that cycle, for it provides them with power. “Keep ‘em poor, keep ‘em stupid” seems to be the new Republican motto when it comes to the issue of education. The conservative elites don’t want public education to be, God forbid, actually educational, because they want to remain superior.Another concerning highlight from this interview was DeVos’ lack of incentive to protect students who are at risk of discrimination and abuse due to aspects of race, sexuality and gender. DeVos' responses to questions of sexual assault on school property is especially disturbing. When asked if she thinks the number of sexual assaults is equal to the number of falsely accused individuals, she says “I don’t know. I don’t know.” As Secretary of Education, DeVos should know the statistics pertaining to sexual assault on school properties and should be offering up ideas to solve the problem. Instead, she is inclined to admit that she is oblivious to one of the most significant issues in our nation’s school systems.Though DeVos’ disastrous interview on 60 Minutes is worrisome, it is by no means unexpected, for she has unwittingly displayed her ignorance in the past. In a prior interview, when asked if private schools receiving federal funding should be allowed to discriminate against their students, DeVos said that such decisions are left up to the states, and that parents are “best equipped” to make schooling decisions for their children. Here, it is obvious that DeVos is trying, but failing, to defend her covert support for private schools that have denied admission to students based on their sexuality, like Lighthouse Christian Academy in Indiana, which utilizes state funding.The answer to the failure of school systems is clearly not to entirely privatize education and promote school choice; it is to allocate more of the federal budget to improving public schools. But DeVos is not a fan of nonprofit, non-Christian schools. She never attended public school herself and sent her own children to religious private schools because she had the means to do so. But, most people are not able to afford such educations and unfortunately, school-choice vouchers won’t be able to close the gap between those with and without access to adequate educations. Despite the Department of Education’s alleged focus on bettering the public school system, last week’s interview demonstrates what was already clear: Betsy DeVos is leading the charge in abandoning it.Ashley is a freshman intending on majoring in journalism.

Chris Taylor, D-Madison, and state Sen. Patty Schachtner, D-Somerset, the bill would provide no-cost options for academic, housing and campus escort arrangements to all UW students who are victims of sexual violence, harassment, stalking or domestic abuse.“We must make sure that victims of sexual violence and harassment are in no way penalized and are reasonably accommodated by their campus community,” Taylor said in a press release. “We need to do everything we can to assist survivors in completing their education and pursuing their dreams.”Influenced by a 44 percent increase of on-campus assaults since 2013, the legislation would require UW-System schools to notify all victims of these options upon report of assault regardless of if the student pursues a formal investigation.In 2015, UW-Madison participated in a survey by the Association of American Universities that concluded that one in four women on campus have been victims of sexual violence.""Things we’ve done include hiring a full-time Title IX coordinator, hiring additional victim advocates, improving training for staff who may be contacted by survivors, requiring (sexual assault) education for graduate and professional students, and requiring additional sexual assault education for all incoming undergraduate students,” said UW-Madison spokeswoman Meredith McGlone in an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio.Despite administrative action, including a requirement that first-year students complete an online sexual assault prevention program, there were 325 reports of sexual assault on campus in 2016, marking a continued increase in reported cases.However, Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment communications coordinator, Shay Jens, stated that an increase in reports does not necessarily equate to an increase in assault. Rather, a shift in campus climate has made more students feel comfortable coming forward.“I also believe that the increasing amount of discussions surrounding sexual assault on college campuses is helping individuals to realize that this is a topic that deserves space in conversations and we all need to have a part in preventing and discussing sexual violence,” Jens said. “I think the UW has done a nice job of providing services and resources for survivors of assault and, while there's room for improvement, it’s off to a good start.”According to Jens, while UW-Madison has a growing number of resources for survivors, this bill would especially benefit smaller UW System schools, who historically have less support to offer.""Sexual violence on college campuses has been a serious and pervasive issue,"" Schachtner told The Daily Cardinal.

Castillo requested that UW-Madison make additional efforts to ensure the campus is a more safe and inclusive space for all.“We want police presence on campus to actually protect its women, trans and nonbinary and disabled students,” Castillo said. “We also demand that the university hold known abusers accountable, whether that be faculty or students.”Castillo also demanded UW-Madison expel known racist and white supremacist students, saying there should be repercussions for hate speech against marginalized students.Dombroe said these changes — if implemented — would benefit the educational and social environment of the UW-Madison campus.Dombroe added that they would like to see UW-Madison make more of an effort to create an inclusive classroom environment for underrepresented students on campus, saying that many students feel “an invisibility” in STEM classes dominated by white men.“The university highly favors cisgender men and has no space for transgender people, no space for people of color and no space for queer people,” Dombroe said.Following the rally, leaders of the event held a panel in the Educational Sciences building to continue the conversation of feminism and women's rights on the UW-Madison campus.",Student groups use International Women’s Day to advocate for underrepresented populations,UWM

The #MeToo movement has dominated all discussions regarding entertainment in the past few months thanks to the silence breakers who came forward with assault allegations against Hollywood’s biggest names, including James Franco, Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein. With the political and social nature of awards season in mind, it’s time to figure out who will win the top prizes and the nominees who truly deserve them.Who will win: Guillermo del Toro, “The Shape of Water”Who should win: Christopher Nolan, “Dunkirk”The directing category is filled with the most exciting group of nominees the Academy has to acknowledge. Guillermo del Toro is expected to take the prize having claimed directing honors from the DGA, BAFTAs and Golden Globes. Regardless of the almost certain win for del Toro, first time nominees Jordan Peele and Greta Gerwig certainly put up a fight. Gerwig becomes only the fifth woman ever to receive a nomination in the category for her heartfelt creation, “Lady Bird,” while Jordan Peele’s directorial debut is an excellent and uncommon example of an artist successfully transitioning between genres with “Get Out.” However, Christopher Nolan’s attention to detail and technical mastery displayed in “Dunkirk” — along with a plethora of critically acclaimed films on his résumé — make him the most deserving in the end.Who will win: Allison Janney, “I, Tonya”Who should win: Allison Janney, “I, Tonya”Allison Janney is an excellent example of a character actor who has devoted her career to playing eccentric and unique side characters as opposed to leading roles. She is the definition of a supporting actress, and her short, yet captivating performance as Tonya Harding’s abusive mother in “I, Tonya” will earn her the golden accolade over her fellow nominees. Unfortunately, Mary J. Blige, Lesley Manville and Octavia Spencer are practically throwaway nominations in an uncrowded category. Laurie Metcalf manages to stand out with a beautiful performance alongside Saoirse Ronan in “Lady Bird,” but the Oscar for Janney is a celebration of an impressive résumé and less dependent on one role specifically.Best Supporting ActorWho will win: Sam Rockwell, “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”Who should win: Richard Jenkins, “The Shape of Water”“Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” is this year’s film to beat in the supporting actor category. The film relies heavily on its three main characters, but Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson rarely demand the screen for themselves against Frances McDormand. Rockwell has consistently taken the lead over other nominees, which includes Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer. In my opinion, Richard Jenkins gives a criminally underrated performance as the voice and conscience of Sally Hawkins’ mute character in “The Shape of Water,” but he unfortunately won’t be able to claim his rightful place as an Oscar winner.Best ActressWho will win: Frances McDormand, “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”Who should win: Saoirse Ronan, “Lady Bird”Frances McDormand previously won the Oscar for Best Actress back in 1996 for “Fargo,” but that will not stop her from grabbing another. McDormand has already won the Critics’ Choice, SAG, Golden Globe and BAFTA in this category, making her the one to beat. Margot Robbie, Meryl Streep and Sally Hawkins have been unable to gain momentum for a possible upset, which leaves Saoirse Ronan as the only one who can possibly steal the award. Ronan gives the most nuanced and challenging performance out of the group, and her Golden Globe win for Lead Actress in a Comedy/Musical will hopefully warrant a change of plans for Academy voters.Best ActorWho will win: Gary Oldman, “The Darkest Hour”Who should win: Timothée Chalamet, “Call Me by Your Name”Prior to late-December, James Franco was the man to beat in this category for “The Disaster Artist.” Unfortunately, the mighty must fall when multiple sexual assault allegations found their way toward the actor and snubbed him of a nomination entirely. In his place, Gary Oldman has taken over the mantle as the Oscar favorite — despite also being accused of sexual assault. While his demanding and transformative performance as Winston Churchill will win him the top prize, newcomer Timothée Chalamet deserves to steal it away. “Call Me by Your Name” effortlessly showcased Chalamet as one of the best young stars working today, and I can almost guarantee that he’ll be back to claim an Oscar trophy in the future.Best PictureWho will win: “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri”Who should win: “The Shape of Water”Similar to last year’s close-fought battle between “La La Land” and “Moonlight,” this year’s Best Picture category has two clearly defined frontrunners. “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” is an actor’s showcase that tells the story of a grieving mother’s fight against a negligent police force: It plays like the direct result of a #MeToo Hollywood. “The Shape of Water” contrasts as a product of old Hollywood that manages to depict a romantic relationship between human and creature. Although it’s too close to call a definitive winner, “Three Billboards” has been this year’s award show favorite across the board, ultimately giving it an advantage for the top prize.For the full list of this year’s nominees and their respective categories, click here.",?Who will win (and who should win) at tonight’s Oscars,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/culture-of-hyper-sexualization-leads-to-high-rates-of-sexual-assault-for-native-women,"February 21, 2018 | 8:08am CST","Nearly half of all undergraduate Native American women on the UW-Madison campus have experienced sexual assault, according to a 2015 campus survey on the issue.For Sam Johnson, UHS Violence Prevention Manager, this statistic is startling but not surprising.“Perpetrators of sexual violence, particularly repeat offenders, strategically pick and choose who their victims are going to be,” Johnson said. “And one of the things they look for is, ‘How well connected is this person to the community socially? How likely are they to be believed if they were to report this to the police?’”The UW-Madison campus is home to few Native American students, only 100 students self-identified as Native American on their application, and about 400 identified as Native American and something else. But while Native students have formed communities of support on campus, they still face erasure and isolation on such a large campus, according to Mariah Skenandore, outreach director and co-president of Wunk Sheek, one of UW-Madison’s Native American student groups.Emily Nelis, a recent UW-Madison graduate in social work and resident of the Bad River reservation, has studied the impact and cause of sexual violence against the Native community.“I don’t think anybody would really truly understand why it’s such a high number for Native women specifically,” Nelis said. “I think it stems from the idea that violence against Native women goes without … consequence for these non-Native perpetrators.”Because of policies surrounding tribal sovereignty, when non-Natives commit crimes — including sexual assault — on reservations, the state government is not permitted to intervene. But the tribal government does not have jurisdiction to press charges against non-Natives either. Instead, the federal government is responsible for intervening, but according to Skenandore, there is rarely redress brought against these perpetrators.96 percent of sexual violence against Native women is perpetrated by non-Native men. For Johnson, this statistic is part of the “best evidence” prevention experts have about the victimization of Native women.“Within social groups it’s typically people that are in the same demographic perpetrating crimes because we live as communities and as people we tend to live in segregation based on racial and ethnic lines,” Johnson said.Intergenerational trauma and colonial violence are often overlooked in discussions about the high rates of sexual violence against Native women, according to Nelis. But they also have a huge effect on why Native communities are victimized.“The effects of intergenerational trauma have both psychological and physical effects on Native people and if you look through a timeline of, say, federal Indian policy … [violence] is pretty prevalent in a lot of that history,” Nelis said.Sexual violence and trauma were a common part of many of children’s experiences in federally run Indian boarding schools. Native American children were sent to these schools in an effort to eradicate Native culture.This historical violence against Native children is still not well understood today but plays a role in the continuous sexualization of Native women, according to Skenandore.Many Americans grew up watching the Disney movie “Pocahontas,” but few know the true story of her life, Skenandore said. In real life, Pocahontas was a 14-year-old rape victim who was taken from her family.“Disney’s version of “Pocahontas” is the most problematic thing I’ve ever seen,” Skenandore said. “For people to turn it into some sort of love story or something is really disgusting and I think in doing so people sexualize Pocahontas and then they sexualize Native women.”This hyper-sexualization translates to the everyday experiences of Native women on the UW-Madison campus today, according to Skenandore.“Native women are expected to fit in this sexual box, in a headdress and with dream catchers everywhere,” Skenandore said. “It really stems from appropriation, honestly, because people appropriate our culture and sexualize themselves while wearing things that traditionally indigenous people would wear.”While the UW-Madison campus sits on Ho-Chunk land, indigenous students can’t always feel safe here, Skenandore said.Walking down State Street, she often receives unwarranted and racist attention from men, asking “what are you?” It’s a question Skenandore says stems from their desire to categorize and exoticize non-white women. Then, she says, when men find out she’s Native, they take the exotiziation to a different level.“If I were to try to educate them in that situation or reject them fully, there’s no saying that they won’t become violent, so for my own safety I have to feed into what they’re saying, at least a little bit,” Skenandore said. “I can’t talk away from that situation … and in doing so those men think what they are doing is okay, but there’s no way for me to express that.”This education is a large part of what Johnson does as a violence prevention manager with UHS.“One of our prevention strategies is men’s engagement … certainly not all people who perpetrate sexual assault or sexual harassment are men, but about 95 percent of perpetrators are,”Johnson said.Following the climate survey results, the UHS team worked to educate themselves on how to specifically support the Native women on UW’s campus. Through trainings with the former UW-Madison American Indian Campus and Community Liaison and the Minnesota Indian Women’s Sexual Assault Coalition, the team worked to understand the experiences of Native women on campus, as well as learn about Native culture.“You’re not ready to talk about this intersection of this issue before you even know the 101 information about history and culture,” Johnson said.In the year following the release of the campus climate survey, Johnson said, she made an effort to participate in cultural events in the Native community and inform students about the resources available through UHS.“Even though there are 43,000 students and 63 native students, our job is to prevent violence before first-time incidents,” Johnson said. “Being connected with communities who are most at risk is part of preventing violence.In the months following the survey release, the university also planned a healing circle for Native American survivors of both sexual violence and racism at the Dejope fire circle. A Ho-Chunk elder facilitated the ceremony, but the event was interrupted by two white students yelling stereotypical Native American “war-cries.”“Everybody in our circle was really shocked, but the elder he just kept going, you know he didn’t pay it any attention,” Nelis said. “It was shameful, it really was … we were angry, we were sad.”While the perpetrators of the incident were forced to apologize and punished for their actions, both Skenandore and Nelis don’t feel the university has done enough to support Native American women on campus.Nelis wishes the university did more to incorporate Native cultural practices when addressing issues of sexual violence against native women. These practices include sweat lodges and other traditional healing ceremonies.For Skenandore, the limited spaces meant to support women on the UW campus focus primarily on the experiences of white women and leave out Native voices — which is problematic on a campus that lies on Ho-Chunk land.“[The administration] doesn’t help us at all. We don’t have any real guidance or resources and I think that when I do reach out it really depends on who I am reaching out to whether or not they are responsive or receptive,” Skenandore said. “I think the things that they do for their women, they do for white women.”Meredith McGlone, UW-Madison’s director of communications, stated that the university is continuously working to ensure the voices of all students are heard.“After the 2015 AAU survey highlighted the special needs of certain groups of students, including Native women, we responded with additional efforts targeted to those groups,” McGlone said in a statement.Despite the marginalization of Native women, Skenandore is grateful for the opportunity to study at UW-Madison and hopes to use her privilege to elevate the voices of others who may not feel heard.“We focus too much on our oppression and not enough on our privilege and we sit here feeling sorry for ourselves … yes I’m a woman, but I’m able bodied, I'm light-skinned, I live in an apartment right now, I’m going to school, I’m privileged in all these ways,” Skenandore said. “We need to advocate for folks who don’t have a voice.”",Culture of hyper-sexualization leads to high rates of sexual assault for Native women,UWM

One was a high school student who became incapacitated and was taken to the hospital for alcohol detoxification treatment.The high school student's friends later reported that the drug rohypnol was found in her system, according to the report. The student was accompanied by friends during the incident and there is no indication she was sexually assaulted.On Nov. 18, Madison police shut down a tailgate party at the chapter house after members disregarded warnings that the crowd had grown too large and no more guests should be admitted.The university report said an underage woman was found to be drinking alcohol and reported that hard liquor also was being served.The third violation occurred Nov. 20. It was reported to a Fraternity and Sorority Life staff member that a Theta Chi member sent a text message to a woman asking her to write ""X"" and ""rush"" on her breasts and send him a photograph.According to the report, the chapter is barred from holding events and activities and from operating with the rights and privileges of a registered student organization.Theta Chi will be unable to admit a fall pledge class, and chapter members must also complete workshops on healthy and respectful relationships and sexual consent.After the suspension ends in October 2018, the organization will be placed on probation, and no alcohol will be allowed at events until Nov. 25, 2018.The Theta Chi chapter will then be placed on general probation until Nov. 18, 2019.

However, they do not give free oral contraceptives like Plan B — something that the proposal is looking to change.Reps. Sophia Alzaidi and Jordan Madden, who formed the proposal, argue that IUDs are not cost-efficient and that oral contraceptives would help a larger number of students. In addition, survivors provided with an IUD must go through an invasive surgery soon after experiencing the trauma of being assaulted.Students who are not survivors of sexual assault are not currently given free contraceptives through UHS.Other Big Ten universities have similar approaches to students’ contraceptives. According to David Golden, director of Public Health and Communications at Boynton Health, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities does not currently supply free contraceptives to sexual assault survivors or the general student population.These contraceptives are, however, available at the Boynton Health pharmacy for a fee.The University of Michigan differs from other Big Ten schools in its policy, which is similar to Alzaidi and Madden’s vision.According to Howard Saulles, the interim director of University Health Service at Michigan, Plan B is available for all students.“There is a charge, but we will bill student's insurances, including the Michigan Domestic Student Health Insurance. Some insurances have a co-pay and some do not. For students who are survivors of sexual assault there is no charge,” Saulles said.On a national level, there is a lack of data concerning free contraception provided by UW-Madison’s UHS.University spokesperson Meredith McGlone cited this lack of information, saying there is no data that shows a student demand for oral contraceptives.The student finance committee will vote on the recommendation at their meeting Monday.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/five-themes-to-watch-heading-into-alec-cooks-first-trial,"February 16, 2018 | 7:00am CST","Former UW-Madison student Alec Cook is set to begin his first of seven trials on Feb. 26 in Jefferson County. Cook faces a total of 21 charges, six of which will be covered in the first trial. Before it begins, here are five themes to watch heading into the trial:1. Lack of time behind bars for UW-Madison students heading into this trialA Daily Cardinal report found that between 2011-’17, five UW students found guilty of sexual assault served a combined less than one year in jail. The maximum sentence for the charges could have totaled more than six decades.Following that investigation, Alec Shiva, who was accused of sexually assaulting another student in a dorm room, was sentenced last September to a year and half in prison.Shiva was charged with three felonies, while Alec Cook is currently charged with 16.2. How high profile the case becameDue to the number of women who have come forward against Cook and the number of charges he faces, the case has gained significant national media attention. Outlets like the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN all have spent time covering the case.The amount of coverage was the basis of the defense’s argument as to why the case should be moved from Dane County. The judge granted that motion, hence why the trial will be held in Jefferson County.3. Defense has won significant motionsLeading up to this trial, Cook’s lawyers have filed and been granted three important motions. The first was the severance of charges, which separated the 21 charges into seven different trials. The defense argued that without severance, the jury would be unable to separate to assess each charge individually, hence making the trial unfair for Cook.The second motion was to suppress a notebook found at Cook’s apartment the day after his arrest. Two Dane County circuit judges sided with the defense that because the photos taken at the initial search were not within the scope of the “Consent to Search” agreed to by Cook, they were invalid when used to obtain a second search warrant to receive the physical copies of the notebook.The third motion, as previously mentioned, was to move the trial out of Dane County due to the high media coverage.4. The foundation of the defense’s argumentAs referenced in an article by Vice, Chris Van Wagner, one of Cook’s two lawyers, has honed in on the argument that the court of public opinion takes control before any actual judicial decision is handed down.While that argument may be more applicable in the motions related to the change of venue or severance of charges, it will be interesting to see how the defense counters evidence used by the state.5. Campus impactCook’s case, because of its alleged severity and extensive coverage, has made sexual assault a prevalent issue among students, administrators and city officials. Since his initial arrest, there have been protests dedicated to sexual assault on campus and there has been widespread campus news coverage of the issue. Since the incident, the university has added a centralized sexual assault reporting system for all students and employees.Correction 2/19/18, 12:06 PM: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Cook was charged with 21 felonies. He's charged with 16. ",Five themes to watch heading into Alec Cook’s first trial,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/as-new-bill-attempts-to-overhaul-juvenile-justice-system-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-lincoln-hills-controversy,"February 15, 2018 | 8:00am CST","A new bipartisan bill introduced earlier this week would close down the contentious Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake schools for juvenile detention and open smaller, local facilities in their place.While some see the schools’ shuttering as a long-awaited victory, other advocates believe far too little is being done to ensure the same issues will not arise again.The state’s juvenile detention centers have created significant controversy in recent years, after numerous lawsuits and allegations of violence, inadequate safety, overpopulation and mistreatment towards juvenile inmates as young as 13.New legislation would close the secluded facilities located in northern Wisconsin and instead provide money to county governments to replace the schools with local, secured residential care centers for all nonviolent offenders.A major concern addressed in the new bill was how far facilities are from most of the inmates’ homes, which critics argued damages the feasibility of visitation and disrupts familial rehabilitation.In addition to location issues, the Lincoln Hills Schools caused financial controversy as well. A 2011 study from the Justice Policy Institute quoted the average cost of locking up a juvenile in a Department of Corrections facility nationwide at about $148,767 per year.The upcoming bill hopes to save money, while also providing more personal and effective care to juvenile offenders across the state.""Providing evidenced-based, secure local options for judges was our goal, and this bill uses an existing, but unused, option to accomplish that goal,"" said state Rep. David Bowen, D-Milwaukee, in a statement. ""Allowing counties to run local, secure residential care centers focused on trauma-informed care with a low number of beds and low staff-to-student ratios will transform how we treat young people and deliver improved outcomes in addition to cost savings.”The federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 declared that the main goal of the juvenile justice system was to keep children out of the adult justice system. However, in the 1980s and ‘90s, there was a shift in focus from rehabilitation to punishment, mirroring the types of reforms implemented in criminal justice practices.There are currently about 150 residents at the Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake Schools from across the state. Approximately 100,000 juveniles are currently held in criminal justice facilities nationwide and arrests of suspects under the age of 18 occur over two million times every year, according to the Federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.Entering a juvenile delinquent into a standardized correctional institution can further damage their behavioral rehabilitation because of the lack of structural stability and therapy provided, according to a report by the Society for Research in Child Development.In 2011, the Ethan Allen School in Waukesha County and Southern Oaks Girls School in Racine County closed due to funding issues, causing many inmates to move to the Lincoln Hills School and leading to the opening of the Copper Lake School for girls.However, obtaining the staff necessary to balance the influx of inmates was challenging. In November of 2017, 67 of 313 staff positions were not filled.Since this change, many allegations of abuse and neglect have poured in. The reports were so alarming that former Racine Circuit Court Judge Richard Kreul wrote a letter to Gov. Scott Walker urging him to push for reform after prison staff failed to react to an inmate-on-inmate sexual assault.“I’ll be thinking long and hard before sending another youth to that place!” Kreul said in the letter.Since 2015, the number of inmates at Lincoln Hills has been cut in half, largely due to a downturn in sentencing to the facility after accusations of abuse became public. However, this also means that the current inmates, and any incoming future inmates, are some of the most challenging cases for the state to deal with.“The students we have now are the most dangerous we've ever had. The counties aren't getting any money from the state, so they only send us students they can do nothing else with, the worst of the worst,” said Doug Curtis, a former Lincoln Hills guard of 20 years, in an interview on Wisconsin Public Television.Out of a staff already spread thin, many have quit or been fired due to extenuating circumstances. This includes Dusty Meunier, the lead corrections officer trainer, who was fired in 2016 after investigators found he trained staff to use improper and dangerous techniques when handling juvenile inmates and had violated facility policy 16 times.Besides the allegations of abuse, critics have also raised concerns over the lack of proper education resources at Lincoln Hills.On its website, the school says it offers its residents the opportunity to receive their high school diploma or GED, and resources for reentering the community such as resumes, cover letters, job applications, interview practice and college planning. However, the facility received several accusations that kids were not being sent to class.“To me, it was a complete breach of trust,"" Robin Dorman, a Milwaukee public defender, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “It’s called Lincoln Hills School, and our kids weren’t receiving an education.”Research shows that providing consistent education for at-risk youth, whether in traditional schooling or juvenile detention centers, is instrumental for effective transitions out of prison.Advocate groups also fear the treatment many juveniles faced at the school may fuel recidivistic activity and damage their chances of entering society as a healthy adult.“Approximately 15 to 20 percent of the young residents are confined in seven by ten foot solitary confinement cells for 22 or 23 hours per day,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin said in a statement about their lawsuit against the facility. “These children are often forced to spend their only free hour of time each day outside the cell in handcuffs, chained to tables. Officers also regularly use Bear Mace and other pepper sprays against the youth, which causes them excruciating pain and impairs their breathing.”Advocates say moving towards secured residential care centers, like the new bill proposes, is a step in the right direction. However, some are not convinced closing Lincoln Hills will result in any reforms other than a change of address.“The risk here is that the state will replicate the mistreatment in Lincoln Hills at the new county-level facilities,” said Larry Dupuis, Legal Director at the American Civil Liberties Union in Wisconsin.In order to improve upon past misconduct, state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee, a cosponsor of the new bill, hopes to add a juvenile solitary confinement ban and transfer control of juvenile corrections to the Department of Children and Families. She also has pushed to give Milwaukee County authority to have a juvenile hybrid facility, and institute requirements for medically-trained staff to distribute medication.""I am glad that what I have repeatedly said and advocated for in past years regarding juvenile corrections is finally getting traction from my colleagues,"" Taylor said in a press release. ""However, it is a shame that our kids and corrections staff had to wait for an election year to see the Governor and his fellow Republicans meaningfully acknowledge their safety concerns.""","As new bill attempts to overhaul juvenile justice system, what you need to know about the Lincoln Hills controversy",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/student-finance-committee-representatives-push-for-emergency-oral-contraceptives-instead-of-iud-provision,"February 12, 2018 | 9:41pm CST","Instead of offering copper IUDs to sexual assault survivors, Reps. Sophia Alzaidi and Jordan Madden introduced a proposal Monday that looks to provide oral emergency contraception so more students would have access.UHS’s $4,000 line item, part of their annual budget they presented to the student finance committee, currently is used as emergency contraception only for victims of sexual violence. However, an IUD costs $800 and is fully covered by UHS. With that math, Madden pointed out that this comes out to only five students.However, the proposal — which looks to eliminate the copper IUD and replace it with oral contraceptives — will reach more students, Madden said. In order to make the contraceptives more accessible, Alzaidi and Madden are looking to have UHS provide them at a highly subsidized cost or for free.According to the proposal, roughly 80-200 students could get access to emergency contraceptives if they were bought at a wholesale rate of $20-$50 per unit and students were able to get them for free. 100-800 students on campus could have access under a subsidized rate of $5-$10 per unit sold.“It’s [the proposal] responsibly distributing student fees to benefit the larger population of the student body with the lowest cost to the administration,” Alzaidi said. “A plan that fiscally prioritizes oral emergency contraceptives would benefit a higher proportion of students than the current plan.”The representatives also cited a 2012 study on clinicians taking part in a California State family planning program. 85 percent of them didn’t recommend the IUD for emergency contraception for the following reasons:However, Madden did point out some of the issues with providing oral contraceptives. They include:Though mostly supportive of the proposal, the body pointed out that IUD’s are the most effective form of birth control as they are still effective five to seven days after unprotected sex, whereas oral contraception, such as Plan B, must be taken within 72 hours for the greatest effectiveness.Representatives also toyed with the idea of providing both forms of contraception, as well as whether to restrict the proposal to just sexual assault victims.“It would be able to be utilized by a lot more people on campus than just the ones that are kind of segregated off,” Madden said. “I do like the idea of having it be offered for free for survivors as opposed to a subsidized cost for the general population, but I also see that being potentially difficult to actually implement on an intake level for these specific issues.”This proposal comes after Madden exchanged emails with UHS Director of Administrative Services Arnold Jennerman about possibly providing Plan B in vending machines at UW-Madison earlier in the semester.However, university spokesperson Meredith McGlone told The Daily Cardinal that there isn’t available data that shows a student demand for oral contraceptives.In the end, the committee decided they needed more time to figure out the final wording for UHS’s recommendation.“I think it’s a great start, but I do think it’s [only] a start,” Rules Committee Chair Dylan Resch said. “It’s important to have the full committee discussion and I think it’s gone really well so far, but I think it takes more than 12 minutes to develop those for the final languages.”SSFC postponed the recommendation and vote on UHS’s budget and will take both items up again on Monday, Feb. 19.",Student finance committee representatives push for emergency oral contraceptives instead of IUD provision,UWM

This Valentine’s week Consent Snaps is making a return with hopes of encouraging conversation around healthy relationships within the campus community.The new filter will be made available on Valentine’s Day and the following weekend in a variety of places on campus, including Memorial Union, Union South and Sellery and Witte residence halls.For Ella Sklaw, a UW-Madison senior who started the initiative last year, the project is really about encouraging conversations about safe sex on campus, even for students who wouldn’t normally have those conversations.“When you are in an area that has a sponsored consent snap you don’t choose whether or not you see it,” Sklaw said.Amid national conversations around sexual conduct and consent, student organizers and UHS staff found Valentine’s week an opportune moment to further the conversation on campus.It’s important that growth in the national conversation not stall the conversation on college campuses where 1 in 4 undergraduate women experience sexual assault, according to Sklaw.“As we’ve approached [sexual assault] as a more public conversation I feel like I personally haven’t heard as much about it on college campuses,” Sklaw said.While she recognized that conversations about consent on college campuses have been happening for a long time, Sklaw said the information is always “pushed to the side” or “denied,” and not enough has actually been done to change the conversation about sexual consent on campus.Originally funded by the Dean of Students office, the Consent Snaps program was revitalized this semester with the help of University Health Services Wellness Programming.For Brooke Nelson, a Student Wellness Assistant at UHS, the Consent Snaps initiative was a perfect fit for the UHS-sponsored “Safety Month” this February. This week, the wellness team is focusing on healthy relationships.“[Consent] is all about being explicit and communicative and I think it’s so important in relationships and hookups that people can communicate and express how they feel,” Nelson said.Consent Snaps will only be returning for the week of Valentine’s Day, but Sklaw emphasized the importance of the project and hopes someone will be able to continue following her graduation in May.“The project’s important to me now … more so than ever because it’s time to continue talking about sexual assault and fighting sexual assault on college campuses,” Sklaw said.","Student led, UHS-funded initiative promotes consensual sex on campus",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/uhs-asks-smaller-budget-increase-still-working-to-increase-mental-health-services,"February 5, 2018 | 11:15pm CST","Two years ago University Health Services got a 17.5 percent increase to their budget — a massive jump from their average yearly increase of two to four percent — in order to expand their mental health services.Now, UHS is still struggling to fill all of the new positions in their mental health department that increase provided for but still wants to expand the services offered to students.Over the past five years UHS has seen an 18 percent increase in medical visits and a 21 percent increase in mental health visits, Arnold Jennerman, one of the UHS interim co-directors, told the Student Services Finance Committee Monday night.For the 2018-'19 fiscal year, UHS will need a 7.07 percent increase to their budget to meet students’ needs, and a mandated three percent wage increase for all university staff. However, the segregated fee students pay for UHS would only go up 2.5 percent and the remaining budget increase could be filled by cash reserves.In the past, UHS hasn’t used up the entirety of the budget allocated to them. Jennerman attributes this variability to hiring difficulties. Their budget proposal assumes at least six percent job vacancies, but they ended 2016-'17 with an 8 percent vacancy rate. Jennerman added that in other years it has been as high as 14 percent.He added that UHS has the most difficulty filling positions for mental health providers, especially as they try to ramp up the capacity of their mental health services.“We have a very diverse population. So we’re looking for, sometimes, some very specialized services,” Jennerman added.He added that a shortage of mental health care providers is a national problem, not just for UHS. A few years ago laws changed to require insurance companies to provide as much coverage for mental health services as medical services — but it didn't change the amount of services available.“It's created a bit of a crisis across the country,” Jennerman said. “Demand for mental health services appears to be rising. It's rising at college campuses. Is that a bad news story or a good news story?”For Jennerman, it's a bad news story because the need for these services is rising, but it’s a good news story because students now have access to mental health care they wouldn't have 20 years ago.Over the summer UHS plans to expand their facilities to include more offices for mental health providers and more space for group sessions.UHS will also provide some emergency contraceptives to victims of sexual assault in the 2018-'19 year.Bill Kinsey, the other interim co-director who presented the proposed budget to SSFC, explained that on a trial basis UHS would offer copper IUDs to victims who do not have enough insurance to cover the device, which otherwise costs $800, or who can not use their parents' insurance.SSFC Rep. Sophia Alzaidi pushed back against this proposal, and questioned why the service wouldn’t be available to all students, calling it “exclusionary.”Kinsey said while he agreed they should support access across campus, the $4,000 line item was only meant to serve as a trial program at the suggestion of obstetricians in UHS’ Women’s Clinic. Additionally, Jennerman questioned if UHS would be the best place to distribute emergency contraception because it must be administered within 72 hours and UHS is only during business hours which may not work for some students' schedules.On Thursday SSFC will tour the UHS facilities before making a final decision on their proposed budget.","UHS asks smaller budget increase, still working to increase mental health services",UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/president-trump-should-not-be-immune,"February 6, 2018 | 8:05am CST","Recently, there have been numerous reports of women speaking out about their experiences with sexual misconduct in Hollywood. Due to these accusations, famous men and their reputations have been rightfully destroyed. The Time’s Up campaign has resulted in change in Hollywood, but as a society, we have a long way to go before time is really up. Even the President of the United States has been accused of sexual misconduct.President Trump has a history of engaging in sexual misconduct and blatantly disrespecting women. Time is up for Hollywood men who have committed sexual assault, but time should also be up for Trump. People such as Harvey Weinstein are currently being ruined, but despite his horrific actions, Trump was elected and is still President. Though this may seem baffling, there are simple explanations for the situation we are in: Trump’s supporters continue to blindly support him no matter how awful his actions are, while Hollywood abusers were abandoned immediately.Trump’s loyal supporters simply dismiss his wrongdoings. It seems that some people think “He’s the President, so he couldn’t have done such a thing. And if he did, it wasn’t that bad.” They could not be more wrong. It is because of those people that he was elected in the first place.Trump has been caught on tape admitting that he has committed sexual assault. Proof of Trump using vulgar language to convey how he grabs women by their genitalia was made public but he was still elected to the highest public office possible. Nineteen women came forward and shared their stories of being sexually harassed by Trump, but his supporters did not bat an eye. Not only is it heart-wrenching, disgusting and frustrating, it is despicably hypocritical.On the other hand, the Hollywood community has taken a stance against men who abuse their power to sexually assault and harass. The Time’s Up campaign has resulted in actors, producers and other members of the Hollywood community standing up against sexual predators and boycotting their films.However, some members of the Republican party have not done the same. One of the most disturbing instances in Trump’s presidency is his public expression of support for Roy Moore in the Alabama special Senate election. Following several accusations that Moore sexually assaulted multiple women, at least one of whom was underage at the time, Trump continued to endorse him. The President of the United States purposely endorsed a pedophile.Additionally, Trump has noted that he’s not a feminist and it is important to analyze what this means. He said that doesn’t consider himself a feminist because he’s “for everyone.” But in reality, the definition of a feminist is one who believes in equality of the genders. So in saying that he’s not a feminist, Trump is saying that he does not value gender equality. When it comes to women, the public has learned, Trump knows very little. This is just one of the many examples of the ignorance the president has displayed.So, Trump says he’s not a feminist. This may be one of the few truths he has spoken, one of the first claims he has made that can be backed up with clear evidence. It is ridiculous that the President of the United States continues to hold the highest public office possible when he is known to have committed sexual misconduct, stood by a pedophile and boasted his lack of knowledge regarding women’s health.Ashley is a freshman intending on majoring in journalism.

The warning said the victim and suspect knew each other.UW-Madison Police Department Director of Communications Marc Lovicott said the victim is not interested in formally reporting the incident to police yet. This means there is not an active investigation, and UWPD does not have any further information at this time. If the victim chooses to work with authorities it will be through the Madison Police Department since the assault occurred off-campus.Lovicott said UWPD “stumbled upon” the sexual assault after being involved with an unrelated case — which he could not elaborate on — that lead them to speak to the victim and their friends.Actions taken in response to the crime fall under the Clery Act, a federal laws that requires universities to issue public warnings when incidents such as sexual assaults occur, which resulted in the crime warning email that was issued Sunday.Lovicott said UWPD is working with UW-Madison campus resources to get the victim assistance if they seek “services to work through what happened.”",Sexual assault reportedly occurred in unnamed fraternity,UWM

Blank called on the Division of Student Life and the Office of Human Resources to also strengthen their record-keeping system. She urged them to “accelerate their efforts” and present a plan to her this semester.In the blog post, Blank emphasized the use of trainings to teach faculty how to respond to sexual assault complaints. She said a new training position will be created within the Office of Compliance to meet increased demands for training; since sexual misconduct has gained national attention, there has been an uptick in requests from campus units for additional, customized training.Blank said over 93 percent of campus faculty and staff have completed the bystander training in the year since its creation. They are mandatory for staff to participate in before receiving wage increases and attempt to educate participants on modes of reporting sexual misconduct and how to handle various situations.Black also shed a spotlight on UW-Madison’s Title IX coordinator, who joined the staff in 2015. She said they work to ensure campus responses to sexual assault and harassment complaints align with UW-Madison’s campus-specific Title IX policy. She mentioned “Title IX Responsible Employees,” who are charged with informing the coordinator of all reports of sexual misconduct.Blank also cited the Provost’s Advisory Group on Sexual Assault and Misconduct as another body that is “an important driver of policy and program changes in the area.” The panel was started as part of a series of recommendations from a 2016 Association of American Universities report on sexual assault on campus, with the goal of better coordinating campus response to sexual violence.“The work of building a culture that discourages sexual misconduct and appropriately responds to such allegations cannot be accomplished by people in ‘Title IX Responsible’ roles alone,” Blank said in the post. “With our campus policy now in place, we need better systems and practices to ensure we are listening broadly, identifying trends or patterns that require action, and equipping managers with the training and tools needed to address these issues.”The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Monday about 100 complaints of employee sexual harassment as well as assault have been investigated across the UW System since 2014. Excluding UW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee because those campuses did not disclose details about harassment complaints, over half of the complaints said professors sexually harassed students. Only seven formal investigations took place at UW-Madison between 2015 and 2017.McGlone said UW-Madison’s small number could be due to survivors reporting assaults to informal sources or staff members outside the Office of Compliance. Blank echoed the sentiment in her blog post — she said often times sexual assaults have been reported at “local levels,” typically to supervisors or department chairs. The chancellor said when these cases are not reported to the Office of Compliance, senior staff is not aware of them and cannot identify “troublesome trends.”“In the coming months, I will challenge UW-Madison to ensure that all reports of sexual misconduct, other than those made to people who must hold them in confidence if asked, are reported to the Office of Compliance,” Blank said in the post. “We must provide a straightforward way to make sure that the information about these complaints is sent forward beyond the immediate unit.”",Chancellor reinforces UW’s sexual misconduct response after 100 investigations into UW employee sexual misconduct surface,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/grammys-2018-recap-powerful-performances-are-marred-by-predictability,"February 1, 2018 | 8:00am CST","The 60th Annual Grammy Awards — the self-proclaimed biggest night in music — aired on Sunday. This year, following what is now tradition for the incredibly out-of-touch award show, The Recording Academy and all those who vote for the nominees snubbed some of the most deserving and relevant candidates for several of their coveted awards.While the award show brought tear-jerking, jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring performances from top tier artists like Kendrick Lamar, Kesha, Childish Gambino and Lady Gaga, it failed to take into consideration the importance of their work.The night was filled with countless predictable awards as well as predictable upsets — awards that should have gone to more deserving artists but followed the tradition of staying safe. Kendrick Lamar went undefeated except for the Album of the Year award which he has now been snubbed from three times in a row despite being the most deserving each year. Additionally, Bruno Mars was the night’s big winner after cleaning up every category he was nominated for.These upsets are not the fault of those who won over those more deserving. Instead, the blame lies with The Recording Academy. Its voting system and unbalanced focus on traditionally popular music (rock, country, etc.) have time and time again obstructed their view from awarding the artists who are widely favored not only by critics in the industry, but also by the fans. 2017 was a year loaded with political statements supported by artists and fans alike. Despite that, the Grammys stuck with their formulaic ceremony when there was full opportunity to make a change that would resonate for years to come.In the wake of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, topics of gender equality and sexual conduct were thrown into the spotlight in Hollywood. Despite the prevalence of outcries for change, the artists who used their music to speak out against these injustices through 2017 were pushed aside once The Recording Academy gave them a few minutes to speak or sing. At first, it seems like an admirable move on their behalf — using their massive audience to bring attention to the flaws of the industry they are so heavily entrenched in. However, those artists were pushed aside in favor of safer choices — like Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran — when it came time to distribute the awards. Given the opportunity to show some sort of solidarity with the women who have voiced their sincere qualms with the state of the music industry, The Recording Academy avoided giving a firm condemnation of sexual assault.Again, The Recording Academy took the safe route with its choices of Ed Sheeran over Kesha for Best Pop Solo Performance, The Weeknd over literally any of the other nominations for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Bruno Mars over Kendrick Lamar for Album of the Year.The issues with the Grammys are long standing. Traditionally overflowing with white men, the award show made a few steps toward racial inclusion with several of the nominations, but women were still pushed aside as only about 20% of the nominees were female.Claiming to be the music’s biggest night should require some sort of inclusion that aligns itself with the messages that so many artists share with their music. As a whole, the music industry is undoubtedly flawed, but with such a massive platform, The Recording Academy has a responsibility to use their voice to amplify the voices of the countless artists they profit from and claim to support. Keep the incredible performances. Keep the unity of the artists in attendance. Keep the spectacle of the event. Change the message. Support the artists first and foremost; listen to their messages and make the appropriate changes. Listen to those who make the music when deciding who the accolades should go to. End the politics and revive the celebration of breathtaking music.",Grammys 2018 recap: powerful performances are marred by predictability,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/no-caution-tape-for-women-in-madisons-police-departments,"January 31, 2018 | 8:50pm CST","When it comes to women’s presence in law enforcement, Madison sticks out.While women hold just 15 percent of federal law enforcement jobs across the country, over 30 percent of the staffs of both the University of Wisconsin-Madison Police Department and the Madison Police Department are made up of women.This is no coincidence.With approximately 30 percent of the department’s 471 officers identifying as women, MPD is better able to represent the demographics of the city of Madison. This police-to-citizen demographic mirror builds trust and comfort between the groups, officials said.According to Madison Assistant Chief of Police Susan Williams, having a gender makeup that somewhat resembles that of the city allows law enforcement to break down communication barriers — like relaying detailed information about sexual assault — that exist and show the community that there are police who understand their experiences.“[A diverse staff] is very important,” Williams said. “It is important so that our community, especially women, can feel comfortable with the department that comes when they call.”The University of Wisconsin-Madison Police Department is also well above the national average in terms of female employment. Of its full-time employees, 37 percent are women. Moreover, 29 percent of UWPD’s leadership — which includes Chief of Police Kristen Roman and Assistant Chief Kari Sasso — are women.Chief Roman is one of the few female police chiefs in Wisconsin. According to UWPD Communications Director Marc Lovicott, Roman is “constantly in the minority” when she attends statewide law enforcement events.While ahead of most other departments across the country, both agencies have continued to look for new ways to diversify.In fact, MPD — whose goal is to eventually have an equal number of male and female officers — has been finding ways to recruit women and many other different kinds of non-obvious candidates “for decades,” according to Madison Chief of Police Mike Koval. Rather than look for people with a background in law enforcement, Koval said he looks for people “across the academic spectrum.” Prime candidates are inquisitive, personable and have the ability to multitask.This has led Koval to send out recruitment letters each year to the coaches of women college athletes — a group that has the skills the department is looking for.Williams — who has been with the department for nearly 30 years — said gender diversity has been something MPD has “proven to be successful at.” She said her ability to do her job has never come into question when working.She also said that while she has spoken to women in similar positions who have had difficult experiences, MPD is “genuine” in its attempt to continue to improve and make sure all of its employees feel welcome and equal.“I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to enter this profession with this agency and have always felt that I was an equal contributing member of the department,” she said.Despite success, there is still room for improvement.In an effort to continue to mirror the changing Madison population, Koval said he would like to increase efforts to hire Latinx people.“We have to make an attempt to get people to understand that these are the faces of our community,” Koval said. “And so [they] should be faces of our police department.”",No caution tape for women in Madison’s police departments,UWM

But according to UW System spokesperson Stephanie Marquis, there were “a number of cases” where no violation was found. The UW System and UW-Madison released the records.“With the continued and enhanced outreach and training efforts, it is not surprising that we have seen an increase in reporting numbers – we want an increase in reporting numbers,” Marquis said. “While our goal is certainly to help prevent sexual harassment or assault in the first place, we want any victims to come forward so we can investigate the incident.”In comparison to other UW System campuses, UW-Madison had “a proportionately small number of cases,” the Journal Sentinel reported. According to UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone, from 2015 to 2017, a total of seven formal investigations took place at UW-Madison.“We think it's attributable to the fact that some cases may be resolved at the department or school/college level and therefore may not rise to formal complaints handled centrally,” McGlone told The Daily Cardinal. “Taking into account the complainant's wishes, the university responds either with an informal resolution — when the complainant does not want to be identified or when the informal route is preferred — or with a formal investigation.”In 2015, UW-Madison participated in the Association of American Universities’ nationwide survey on sexual misconduct and assault. The results showed 53 percent of female graduate and professional students reported that they’ve dealt with sexual harassment on campus.“While sexual harassment began getting national attention only this past fall, at UW-Madison, the results of this 2015 survey were a wake-up call to campus on the issue of sexual harassment. The survey made clear that sexual harassment is under-reported here (as it is at other campuses/workplaces),” McGlone said.Since then, the university has taken measures such as creating the full-time Title IX Coordinator position and requiring all employees to take sexual harassment and assault prevention training. Employees who fail to complete the training won’t be eligible for the four percent wage increase that is likely to go into effect at UW-Madison.In November, university officials announced that UW-Madison will be establishing a centralized reporting system to keep track of sexual harassment and assault reports. McGlone said its implementation is “in the early stages.”The university is also working on updating their policy on relationships between faculty and students to be in line with the UW System’s. Under the System's policy, students and faculty can’t have sexual relationships, but UW-Madison’s policy still allows this.“There has been no hold-up; we’ve been working diligently on this,” McGlone told The Cap Times.McGlone told The Daily Cardinal that UW-Madison’s consensual relationship policy is nearly finished and will go to all shared governance groups on campus for feedback and then endorsement. Administration is hoping to have the policy in effect by next fall, she said.",UW-Madison reports “a proportionately small number of cases” out of total UW System sexual harassment cases,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/01/dane-county-elections-forum-major-takeaways-and-impact-for-students,"January 25, 2018 | 11:04pm CST","Sixteen candidates for Dane County’s Board of Supervisors participated in a forum Thursday night hosted by Our Wisconsin Revolution to promote policy priorities and goals for the county.All 37 seats on the board are up for election on April 3 but only five districts have contested races, three of which — Districts 6, 11 and 15 — will have primaries on Feb. 20.Our Revolution, a nationwide organize created to maintain the political momentum established by Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary, works to promote progressive policies through grassroots political campaigns.What was discussed?Candidates promoted their top two policy goals, which by the last candidate established two consistent priorities.The first was racial disparity in Dane County.According to a 2013 baseline report by Race to Equity, the 2011 unemployment rate of African Americans in Dane County was 25.2 percent compared to 4.8 percent of white residents. Additionally, in 2011, more than 50 percent of African-Americans lived below the federal poverty line.Numerous candidates mentioned reforming the local prison and improving affordable housing to improve these disparities, among other solutions.In November, the current board approved a $76 million dollar jail renovation program which was met with significant criticism, namely activists fighting for prison reform.Al Matano, the incumbent for District 11, acknowledged he voted to finance the jail project after originally voting against it.“Sometimes you have to look at some things not from a decision point but as an opportunity not to burn bridges,” he said.The second major issue was climate change and sustainability. Pam Porter, running for District 6, highlighted the abundance of blue-green algae in Madison’s local lakes this past summer, which can produce toxins harmful to fish and humans.“I’m running for the board because we should elect someone who understands the law, understands the science and scope of the problem and someone who has a vision for sustainable agriculture,” she said.Why should students care?David Pelikan, spokesman for UW-Madison College Democrats, believes there are four primary reasons why students should be interested in the county election: innovation, affordable housing, job growth and sexual assault prevention.“The county has a supporting role in helping groups like the rape crisis center so that people in those situations can get the help that they need,” he said.Pelikan added that while the College Democrats do not endorse Our Wisconsin Revolution, they believe that progressive policies are important to the Democratic Party.“I think especially for our age group, and for students and for many people across the country, progressive policies are the way to go,” he said.Which districts matter to students?While UW’s campus doesn’t lie directly on one of the five contested districts, District 6 is the closest, encompassing a majority of the northern border along Lake Monona including the entirety of Williamson Street.The candidates vying for the seat promoted improved transportation and affordable housing as resources they will fight for to better assist students.Britt Cudaback, who herself is finishing her law degree, cited her own student debt and said she knows the obstacles students face.“That’s something I bring to the table insofar as that’s a barrier that students have to overcome,” she said. “We need someone who understands what it means to have to work full-time and go to school.”Another candidate, Yogesh Chawla, added that county supervisors need to make it easier for students to vote.“We need to prioritize student participation in government and one way to do that is by making it easier for students to vote,” he said.",Dane County Elections Forum: Major takeaways and impact for students,UWM

These include one count of second-degree sexual assault and use of force, three counts of third-degree sexual assault, one count of strangulation and suffocation and one count of false imprisonment.The trial is scheduled to last four days.

Before the show even began, stars appeared on the red carpet draped in all black to support the Time’s Up organization. Powered by women, Time's Up addresses the systemic inequality and injustice in the workplace, especially regarding sexual harassment, assault and inequity. Eight actresses — including Amy Poehler, Meryl Streep, Emma Stone and Emma Watson — were accompanied by activists in various fields, from sports to immigration to preventing sexual violence against farmworkers. This was done in hopes of shifting the public’s attention from abusers to survivors and lasting solutions. The sea of black on the red carpet cast a somber, yet striking shadow on the evening and resonated throughout the ceremony.The night’s most memorable moments revolved around powerful women in Hollywood discussing the #MeToo movement and promoting Time’s Up, from Oprah Winfrey’s inspirational speech to Natalie Portman's slight, but powerful jab pointing out the all-male nominees for the “Best Director” category. Portman’s comment was made all the more prevalent after Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” won the award for “Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy.” Barbra Streisand echoed this remark with a comment regarding her win for Best Director in 1984. “I’m the only woman to get the best director award,” Streisand said upon taking the stage. “That was 34 years ago. Folks, time’s up!” Before Streisand announced the last category of the evening, Best Motion Picture — Drama, which went to “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” she stated that more women directors are needed and more need to be nominated. While “Three Billboards” and “Big Little Lies” reaped in numerous awards, Oprah’s speech undoubtedly stole the show.All hail Oprah Winfrey. Her acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille award not only brought the audience to its feet (multiple times), but has everyone hoping for “Oprah 2020.” Winfrey is the first black woman to receive the Cecil B. DeMille award, which is presented for “outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.” Like she has done many times before, Oprah used her prominent platform to call out injustice in Hollywood and beyond, for both women and minorities. It’s difficult to summarize such an emotionally and politically charged speech: My words pale in comparison to hers. You can (and should) read the full transcript of her speech here.Seth Meyers — who admittedly stated he was in a not-so-great position as a straight, white male hosting the awards this year — did what few could’ve done: have an opening monologue that was funny, self-deprecating and poignant. He was also one of the few men in the room to actually speak about women in Hollywood’s struggle for gender equality. Most men sported “Time’s Up” pins but few took the time to address the issue in acceptance speeches or on the red carpet. Meyers stated, “The people in this room worked really hard to get here, but it’s clearer now than ever before that the women had to work even harder. So thank you for all the amazing work that you’ve all done and continue to do. I look forward to you leading us into whatever comes next.” You can read the rest of his opening monologue here.The Golden Globe Awards is widely known as the younger, less distinguished award when compared to the Oscars.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/12/cephus-providing-wisconsin-the-receiving-threat-they-desperately-needed-last-year,"December 5, 2019 | 1:44pm CST","Quintez Cephus made sure to make the most of Axe week and the matchup against rival Minnesota. He had missed the last two games against Minnesota. He missed the 2017 matchup due to a season-ending right leg injury that he suffered early in the season at Indiana. He would miss the entire 2018 season, including the loss at home to Minnesota, amidst a suspension due to charges of sexual assault. “For every player that misses it, you feel for them, and yet ‘Q’ will bounce back. One of the beautiful things about coaching is seeing these guys play and grow and develop, and football is the vehicle we get to use,” head coach Paul Chryst said following the news that the injury would end the season for Cephus. Chryst thought ‘Q’ would bounce back and he has done so in an emphatic way. The junior wide receiver now leads a talented group of receivers on the season with 45 catches for 720 yards and six touchdowns. Cephus leads a group that junior running back Jonathan Taylor labeled as one of the best ever, if not the best. “We haven’t seen a receiving core in Wisconsin like this in a long time, probably ever,” Taylor said. Cephus’s year started with a bang in Week 2 when he torched Central Michigan for six catches, 130 yards, and two touchdowns. Now with the Axe and a Big Ten West title on the line, Cephus had perhaps his best performance of the season considering the snowy, wet conditions the teams were dealing with. “‘Q’ was big. [He] kind of had that look from the beginning that he was going to go attack this one,” Chryst said. He finished off the game with five catches, 114 yards, and a touchdown.“Getting a shot in these types of games, I wasn’t able to be there but now I am here and I have everything in front of me and I want to make the most of the opportunity,” Cephus said following the win. In the days leading up to the game, all of the talk was focused on Minnesota’s talented group of wide receivers that included two 1,000-plus yard receivers, but Cephus was arguably the best receiver on the field and made the biggest plays. Junior quarterback Jack Coan found Cephus open down the middle to open up the scoring in the second half for the Badgers with a 47-yard bomb to put Wisconsin up 17-7. The Gophers defense was getting setup after Mason Stokke motioned out wide, leaving a linebacker Thomas Barber to cover Cephus. “The coverage we were getting, we knew we might have a chance with ‘Q’,” Coan said. “Whenever we have a one-on-one, it’s always a good matchup for us and I just tried to put it in a location where he can get it.“I’m just really lucky to be able to throw to him,” Coan added.Quintez Cephus was reinstated to the university and allowed back on the football team just days before the season opener at USF but has been grateful for ever opportunity. “Quintez has been huge. He’s an unbelievable teammate and brings energy. He cares about this team and his teammates as much as any guy and there is something that’s infectious about that,” Chryst said. “He loves playing the game and appreciates the opportunity to play the game.” Quintez sent the message to the group of receivers: “don’t take anything for granted. You never know. Just go out there and play every play like it’s your last. Just go out there and give everything you can,” junior wide receiver Kendric Pryor said was the message Quintez sent. Cephus has made the most of a second opportunity and now leads a revamped Wisconsin passing attack that is on their way to the Big Ten championship against Ohio State. Cephus missed the 2017 Big Ten title with the game due to injury and will surely be looking to lead an upset bid with the Buckeyes defense locked in on stopping Jonathan Taylor.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/12/native-american-women-more-likely-to-experience-sexual-violence-on-campus-across-country,"December 5, 2019 | 9:27am CST","Twenty percent of women will be sexually assaulted at some point in their lives — but that number jumps to 45 percent when applied to Native American women, according to the National Sexual Violence Research Center.Native American women have been at higher risk for crimes related to sexual violence for decades now, across the country, state and on college campuses.Despite the innate relationship between Wisconsin land and Native American communities, the UW-Madison participated in the Association of American Universities Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct for the first time in 2015. The results showed close to 50 percent of Native American women on campus have experienced some form of sexual violence.UW-Madison took part in the AAU survey for a second time in 2019, releasing its findings in October. The results reflected similarities to 2015 — and even an increase in some percentages related to Native American women.This year, 66 percent of American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander females on campus experienced sexual harassing behaviors; however, not enough women in the category reported sexual assault for a percentage to even be calculated.Barriers in data collectionWhen considering absent percentages, some technical factors come into play, like changes in the survey questions from 2015 and also the sample size of the indigenous population on campus compared to total students. Native American students made up less than one percent — 0.95 percent exactly — of the student body for the fall 2019 semester, according to the Office of the Registrar.Nonetheless, similar findings to the UW-Madison AAU survey highlighting the discrepancy between experiencing and reporting sexual assault parallel other university campuses, reservations, work environments and cities across the country. And these numbers probably aren’t fully representative of the actual rate Native American women experience sexual violence as they often don’t report to authorities, according to Megan Thomas, communications specialist with the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.“What we know is that there are a lot of barriers in place for any survivor of sexual assault to come forward, but there are some that are even more specific to Native American survivors,” Thomas said. “One of the things we hear about is historical trauma: this collective injury on a population that can carry across generations. Those memories, those events, those traumas will be passed down through generations and can lead to distrust of law enforcement.”Even when women do report, Thomas stated that Native American communities can experience geographical barriers, like lack of access to law enforcement or medical care.The university has expanded its resources for students in the past decade. There is now a department in University Health Services dedicated to violence prevention, a designated Title IX coordinator position and new requirements for students.But the rates persisted.Perpetrators and jurisdictionThere are various factors in addition to lack of trust with law enforcement that keep women from reporting their experience. Thomas stated that another hindrance has to do with the perpetrators, who are mainly white. While 35 percent of Native American women experience violence from other Native Americans, that number increases to 97 percent when considering those who experience violence by an interracial perpetrator, according to the National Institute of Justice. “Perpetration by people outside of Native communities against people in Native communities is common, which is the reverse of any other sexual violence,” Thomas said. “That's a whole other element [of] that continued marginalization.”Native women experiencing these crimes at a higher rate than other racial and ethnic groups is not a coincidence, it’s an epidemic, according to Samantha Skenandore, member of the Ho-Chunk Nation and lawyer in service to tribal nations for the past 15 years.Skenandore, who focuses her practice on both federal Indian law and tribal law, has represented 80 sexual assault victims, most of whom were indigenous clients. Of those, 78 were women. “Most cases I've worked on involves a white male on tribal territory assaulting a native woman,” Skenandore stated. “It's almost always that case. And how do you stop it? Well, who are the perpetrators and where are the crime taking place? Because that defines [the] jurisdiction — and then you know what programs and services are needed.”Crimes committed against Native American women on the UW-Madison campus are taking place on land that belongs to the Ho-Chunk Nation. And that’s why jurisdiction matters.Wisconsin is one of six states in the country that allows for state government control over offenses committed against American Indians on tribal land, according to Public Law 280.Not only does this complicate the relationship between tribe and state, which have historically competed for resources within tribal land, but it can also produce unique barriers to Native American women seeking help from a criminal justice authority on tribal lands, Skenandore said.“It's a crazy political game of trying to keep tribal sovereignty as minimal as possible, and also trying to have state law apply in tribal land,” Skenandore said. “In federal Indian law, [a] large premise is that the federal government has a responsibility to take care of tribal nations — states are generally not allowed in that relationship.” When PL 280 was put in place in 1953, it granted states broad criminal jurisdiction. But that control remained concurrent with tribal criminal jurisdiction.While state government and tribes battled for authority, the federal government saw the law as a way to drop financial and technical support for tribal resources in designated states — like on all reservations in Wisconsin, except the Menominee Territory.According to Skenandore, due to lack of federal dollars and a general absence of state support, many tribal court systems have failed to function as well as they could. Many American Indian Nations in Public Law 280 states still do not have functioning criminal justice systems.“If I laid out for you what the sexual assault, domestic violence laws look like in the seven jurisdictions that I'm barred in, you'll see them look pretty different because they're all in different phases of governance,” Skenandore said. “Everybody assumes tribal courts are all the same and they're not. They can be like a baby in diapers or they could be the old wise man.”The power of cultural healingKristin Welch is a community organizer with Menikanaehkem, a nonprofit on the Menominee Reservation, who works on several initiatives: food sovereignty, solar power, language and culture revitalization and with a women’s cohort focused on healing.Welch stated that violence against Native women began with colonization. And while we might not see the repercussions of this in a traditional sense, that oppression hasn't disappeared, it's just integrated into new systems.""It's almost ingrained in every part of our lives, this violence against us,"" Welch said. ""And the jurisdictional issues don’t help, they make us an easy target.”Additionally, she explained other barriers for Native American women, like how seeking help from agencies and institutions remains stigmatized and the minimal policing on tribal land.The Menominee land is the only reservation in Wisconsin not subject to PL 280, meaning the federal government still provides tribal courts with resources, both monetary and occupational. Still, it's difficult to process non-native offenders because they get lost within the system or it takes too long, according to Welch.Welch stated there is a cycle of oppression Native women face that requires a greater fix than jurisdictional correction or an increase in cultural awareness. There is inequality built into the system. When Welch met with other Native women in her community, they realized they all had experienced sexual assault or domestic violence at some point in their lives. From there, they figured out how to move forward together.“We have to first heal ourselves and address our own trauma before we can help other people,” Welch said. “We rely on our culture for that. And that's where the empowerment comes from, understanding we have all the tools to heal, all the tools to organize and empower women in our culture and original language.”Moving forward and shifting responsibilityBoth Welch and Skenandore agreed that it’s important to society — as well as college campuses — to examine how indigenous women have been portrayed over time.“We're hypersexualized, so we have to deconstruct that image and that idea in Western Society because it is dangerous,” Welch said.“The focus should be on educating offenders and holding them accountable, first and foremost. That should be a campus responsibility.”And while UW-Madison and schools across the state have committed to developing more cultural awareness — emphasizing the UW System’s desire to develop relationships with sovereign Nations and acknowledge traditions, beliefs, governance, laws, codes and regulations — Skenandore says it’s not enough. In this year’s AAU survey, indigenous students had the least amount of trust the university would conduct a fair investigation, not even registering a percentage in the final data. Thomas stated that historical trauma could be a potential explanation.Despite this, Skenandore sees an opportunity for institutions to do more.  “We have so much persuasive power with adolescent people to tell them what they are and what they aren't,” Skenandore said. “And it's the same thing with all of these people that can be doing things like the chancellor and the student government. The university is a great place to make a long-standing change because these are all future leaders.” For Welch, the opportunities to fight injustice against Native women are not few and far between; they are powerful reminders of the resilience of indigenous populations and can be carried across college campuses and the nation.“My uncle had always said that we were perceived as remnants of war — and we are,” Welch said. “But we're also incredibly resilient and strong. Every attempt to destroy us failed and that’s incredibly beautiful and empowering.” ","Native American women more likely to experience sexual violence on campus, across country",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/11/the-latest-battle-for-paul-bunyans-axe-set-to-be-the-biggest-in-years,"November 29, 2019 | 10:24pm CST","One game.After months of anticipation, a long summer of training, and 13 weeks of the season, that’s all that remains in deciding the winner of the 2019 Big Ten West: one game.  It just so happens to feature college football’s oldest rivalry, No. 12 Wisconsin (6-2 Big Ten, 9-2 overall) and No. 8 Minnesota (7-1 Big Ten, 10-1 overall) in the 129th battle for Paul Bunyon’s Axe.  “We wouldn’t want this any other way,” said Wisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor last Saturday.  “Big Ten West on the line, rivalry game, The Axe. You come to Wisconsin for these moments. I’m sure we’ll have a great week of preparation in order to bring our A game.”For the Badgers, the odds of even having a chance to play for the division Saturday at Minnesota looked dire following the team’s upset loss at Illinois early in the year.  Yet Wisconsin, which needed to win each of its final four games of the season to head to Indianapolis next Saturday, has put itself back on track with commanding wins against No. 17 Iowa, Nebraska, and Purdue. “We [put] ourselves in a position where our backs were against the wall and we had to win,” said Senior linebacker Zack Baun.  “Playing good November football is what we wanted to do...we wanted to win all four and we’re three-fourths of the way there.”All that stands in their path is a Minnesota team that has exceeded all expectations in 2019.  Despite three underwhelming non-conference performances, the Golden Gophers have dominated Big Ten opponents, compiling a 7-1 record in conference with a dominant plus-151 point differential across the eight games.  Minnesota’s lone loss in Week 12 at Iowa, a 23-19 affair in which Minnesota failed to capitalize on many second-half chances, put Wisconsin back in control of its conference destiny.“They’ve come ready and have performed very well against the teams we’ve seen,” Wisconsin center Tyler Biadasz said of the Minnesota defense.  “We have to attack them.  I don’t think they’ve been tested like we can test them. We’ll be ready for them.”Many scouts see Biadasz, an NFL Draft-eligible junior, as the best center in the country, and he’s played like it the last few weeks.  Since the Wisconsin offensive line’s dismal performance against No. 1 Ohio State in October, the run game has been virtually unstoppable.  The person receiving all the statistical credit for the offensive line’s work, Jonathan Taylor, has put together performances of 250, 204, and 222 rushing yards with three touchdowns over the past three weeks.  Playing in what was likely his final game at Camp Randall last Saturday, Taylor was honored on the final drive with a standing ovation from the home crowd following a curtain call by head coach Paul Chryst.  Among a long list of standout ball carriers at Wisconsin, Taylor was arguably the best of them all.“It was definitely an honor,” Biadasz said of playing in front of Taylor.  “You can’t say enough about him as a player and a person. He has made so much history here. It was kind of emotional because of everything we’ve gone through.”Yet it wasn’t just Taylor carrying the ball last Saturday for the Badgers; the team broke out the wildcat formation five times, converting four first downs and two touchdowns.  Backup running back Garrett Groshek and the Badger’s secret offensive weapon Aron Cruickshank each took direct snaps from Biadasz to the endzone for scores, doing their part in Wisconsin’s eight scoring drives.  Wisconsin didn’t punt a single time all afternoon, crossing into Purdue territory on each of their 12 drives. “Everybody had a chance and opportunity to touch the ball and do what they can do,” Cruickshank said of Wisconsin’s diverse offensive gameplan last weekend.  “Finally I got to go on the field...and show what I can do...it’s important to show that I’m more than just a jet runner.”When asked if we should expect to see that offensive creativity continue into Wisconsin’s crucial battle against Minnesota Saturday, coaches and players declined to tip their hand.  Yet the success of the jet sweeps and wildcat plays should make them appealing against a Golden Gopher defense that has held strong against the run this year. “It gives you one more gap to have to defend,” Chryst said of the challenges of defending the wildcat package.  “If you start cheating a little bit, we’ve got a chance for some [conversions]...it was helpful.”Although Wisconsin’s offensive gameplan usually downplays the importance of the quarterback position, junior Jack Coan has done everything asked of him through 11 games this season. The passing game has remained mostly short and conventional, and Coan has limited his turnovers (15/4 TD/INT ratio this year), and has developed a great deep threat with wide receiver Quintez Cephus during the second half of the season. Should Minnesota manage to slow down Jonathan Taylor early, expect Coan to look for Cephus in big third down spots.“I had chances to make plays and do some great things for the team this year,” Cephus said Saturday.  “I’m not done doing what I want to do here yet...It has been great to make plays when my number’s called.”Cephus, who missed all of last season due to sexual assault allegations, was found not guilty of both counts this August and allowed to rejoin the team.  The missed time was noticeable early on in non-conference play, but Cephus has found his stride as of late, with 21 receptions and two touchdowns over the last six games.  He managed to get open twice in four plays during the second half against Iowa, accounting for 74 yards of Wisconsin’s 86-yard touchdown drive that put them ahead of the Hawkeyes for good. “It’s been a great year...We wanted to make sure that we didn’t lose at Camp Randall,” said Cephus in reflection.  “I wasn’t here with the guys building the foundation in the winter and spring, but I was able to fit in by continuing to work hard and build on what we had already.”Whether it’s Cephus, Taylor or Coan, the Badgers are going to need to play sound offensively if they hope to advance to the Big Ten Championship game next weekend.  In what seems like the biggest battle for the Axe in quite some time, Wisconsin understands the challenge ahead of them. “There are no second chances when you get out on the field,” Biadasz said.  “It’s the biggest rivalry in college football. That’s enough said.”",The latest battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe set to be the biggest in years,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/11/cardinal-picks-five-books-to-read-this-november,"November 7, 2019 | 8:00am CST","It’s officially November, and autumn is quickly transitioning into the frigid Wisconsin winter that we all know and love. Students are starting another round of midterms, and many are preparing to go home for the holidays. Holiday breaks are a great time to catch up on all the things that have gotten pushed to the side during the busy semester, including books you’ve been meaning to read but just haven’t gotten around to yet. You might want to pick up a book on a niche topic that a professor mentioned during a lecture, a book recommendation from a friend or maybe your favorite author just published a novel. However, if you are at a loss for leisure reading material, I’ve compiled a list of some distinctive November reads to fill your holiday break. “Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood” — Trevor NoahTrevor Noah — host of The Daily Show — chronicles his unconventional childhood growing up during aparthied in South Africa while being mixed race. This novel consists of 18 stories, all told with the unshakable sincerity and lively humor that characterizes Trevor Noah’s narrative style. This book tackles themes that are present in most coming-of-age memoirs but complicates them by placing them in a tumultuous environment ripe with political instability and inequality. This is a strikingly relevant novel for many reasons, one of which is that Nov. 6 is the day that the United Nations first condemned the apartheid regime in 1962 — it would take nearly 31 years for apartheid in South Africa to officially end in 1993.  “The Red Fast Road: A Plainsong” — Stephen Graham JonesThanksgiving is a holiday that has traditionally, and problematically, been associated with a celebratory feast between the Pilgrims and Native Americans. In recent years there has been a lot more discussion about the injustices that Indigenous people have faced, and continue to face, in this country. However, current Native American cultural contributions are still often overlooked. “The Red Fast Road: A Plainsong” draws heavily on Native American culture and juxtaposes it against a very modern setting. If you’re looking for a fiction novel with a lot of action and a bit of surrealism, then this is definitely a book you should consider reading. Stephen Graham Jones masterfully crafts a novel that feels like a post-apocalyptic imitation of the western genre, while still remaining culturally relevant. “Know My Name: A Memoir” — Chanel MillerOne of the most anticipated memoirs of 2019, “Know My Name” is a touching story of pain, reclamation and hope. This novel is written by Chanel Miller, whose anonymous victim statement regarding her sexual assault by Brock Turner went viral in 2016. Miller is an extraordinary writer who intertwines her own story with the broader failings of the justice system when dealing with sexual assaults“Eat Joy”This book is a collection of essays, drawings and recipes, from 31 acclaimed writers. It examines how food shapes our lives and relationships, and does that through personal anecdotes from talented literary figures. The novel includes stories from very diverse writers, ranging from stories of family dinners in Persia, to learning to feed yourself as a single 20 year old in America. The recipes reflect this diversity, they include everything from a recipe for brownies that involves sitting on the floor and eating the brownie mix out of the bag, to a long, detailed recipe for Tahdig — a traditional Persian dish. A perfect book for the food-centered Thanksgiving holiday, this novel will give you plenty to talk about, and cook, when with family. “The Yellow House” — Sarah M. BroomSarah M. Broom chronicles the nearly 100-year history of her family in East New Orleans; this novel is, in a sense, the historical memoir of a home. Broom tackles the historical struggles of wealth and power divisions in New Orleans, then moving to the present and dealing with her own relationship to her family home. This book is a wonderful analysis of family and tradition within the culture of New Orleans, making it a captivating read for the Thanksgiving holiday.Raynee Hamilton is a literature columnist for The Daily Cardinal.

Consequently, there will be a significant decrease in the amount of police oversight on Langdon Street.Figueroa held the position for the past two years, serving as a liaison between UW-Madison’s Greek office and various parties like MPD, private security firms, property management companies, as well as students living Langdon Street. The Madison Police and Fire Commission, who supervises hiring processes within the police department, refused to comment on the change. MPD was unavailable to comment.Officer Figueroa will also work with the new UW-Madison Downtown Liaison Officer to provide information on the neighborhood and what current safety concerns look like — this year alone has seen cases of residential burglary, battery and sexual assault, according to MPD.Langdon Street houses the majority of UW-Madison’s fraternities and sororities and is a well-known hub for parties and drinking culture on campus. Officer Figueroa has worked closely with greek life — they even inform him of all registered parties and tailgates. “Police [presence] is very important because when we know where people are going, we can provide safety for that area,” Figueroa said. “It provides us the information of where things are happening so we can provide maybe an extra eye or some resources within that area.”Many sororities and fraternities fear potential consequences of the change, mainly regarding students’ safety, Gamma Phi Beta President Lily Warner said.“Everyone’s concerned given that there has been serious incidents that have resulted in truly near-death experiences,” Warner said. “The only reason that people in those situations were able to receive help so quickly is because there was an officer who was stationed on Langdon.”Fraternities and sororities on campus said they felt “blindsided” by the news, according to Warner.“The school didn't take the time to reach out to let us know the areas we are operating in were going to [have] less police presence,” Warner said. “I can't communicate to chapter members to be more aware on Langdon if I don't know that there's something wrong.” Officer Figueroa’s last day as regional officer will be Jan. 26. He said students who are upset about the change should reach out to Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway and UW-Madison.“We knew that Officer Figueroa was always dedicated to the issues pertaining to our neighborhood, which always was a comfort,” Warner said. “Without that, it feels like we're being left behind in the safety narrative.”[Editor’s Note: 10/30/2019, 8:00 a.m.] An earlier version of this story had information from Jordan Parsbrig, Chair of the Student Services Finance Committee of Associated Students of Madison, which he has since retracted.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/10/doc-seeks-media-coverage-of-home-visits-to-registered-sex-offenders-on-halloween,"October 31, 2019 | 9:00am CDT","“Would you normally let your six-year old walk outside by themselves in the dark?” Wisconsin Department of Corrections Sex Offender Registration Program Director Grace Knutson asked. “No, so let’s use this as an opportunity. When we can all as adults keep kids safe, that lessens the opportunity of a sex offender having an opportunity to reoffend.” Knutson acknowledged there is no other time of year children are out in the streets at night, often alone, going to strangers’ houses asking for candy. To mitigate potential threats, the DOC increases their street presence on Halloween, and ensures the lack of presence of formerly incarcerated sexual offenders. However, there is not an increase in sexual crimes on Halloween. In fact, Knutson said they decrease, while crimes like pedestrian-involved car accidents are more prevalent.“A majority of the time there are very few sex offenses that happen as a result of trick-or-treating or as a result of Halloween,” Knutson said. Despite this, registered offenders on community supervision across the state must abide by a set of rules inhibiting them from participating in trick-or-treating activities. They are mandated to turn their porch lights off, have no decorations or candy both inside or outside the house, as well as not wear costumes. In addition to the restrictions, the DOC conducts home visits along with local law enforcement and parole agents to ensure the parolees’ are following protocol. Last Halloween, more than 2,200 visits occurred with 43 sex offenders taken into custody for violating supervision requirements. “There are 31 offenses that require registration, we do not differentiate between somebody who has a hands-on offense versus a hands-off offense,” Knutson said. “If the statute says they are required to register, they are required and that is what we are driven by.” Despite the wide-range of offenses one can be added to the registry for, the DOC determines which offenders to visit based on their proximity to other offenders and high density trick-or-treating zones — not their original crime.Halloween is the only time the state agency administers this concentrated level of home visits, which have been mandated for the last 10 years.This year, the DOC invited media outlets to participate on the trick-or-treat walk-alongs with agents. Deputy Communications Director for the DOC Clare Hendricks believes this is an opportunity for members of the media to see law enforcement operations firsthand and subsequently generate awareness about safety precautions to the public. “There can be a lot of anxiety around Halloween because you do not know who is out there and sometimes people might be so-to-speak afraid or worried, but reminding folks that our probation and parole agents are out there and what we do on a regular basis –– let alone on Halloween –– can be reassuring,” Hendricks said.However, City News Editor at The Cap Times Jason Joyce said the newspaper will not be sending any reporters to the walk-along with parole agents because these experiences are often skewed to show a specific part of an operation. “While we certainly cover these topics –– corrections, sexual harassment and assault, how formerly incarcerated individuals adapt to lives after prison –– this pitch qualifies as being a little too packaged for our style of enterprise reporting,” Joyce explained. The backlash the DOC receives from communities containing formerly incarcerated individuals on the sexual offender registry — especially communities with children — may be another reason for their increased publicity efforts this year.“My first thought is: this is the Department of Corrections concerned about its image and concerned about controversy that comes up with placing sex offenders back into communities,” UW-Madison Journalism and Mass Communication Professor Robert Dreschel said. “They are using this as a strategy. They hope to make people more comfortable and give people more confidence that they really are keeping an eye out.” However, it is unclear whether this additional protection is necessary beyond ensuring the public and creating awareness.  Data from the DOC shows low rates of recidivism –– the rate at which those formerly incarcerated commit crimes again –– for sexual offenders in comparison to other offenders. In 2010, sexual offenders acquired a recidivism rate of 16.8 percent compared to 31.6 percent of general offenders three years after release from prison. At this time, 46.7 percent of recidivism crimes for sexual offenders were violations of public orders –– like failure to provide registry information or obstructing a parole agent –– which includes disobeying Halloween restrictions. This number highlights sexual offenders low risk to engage in the same criminal behavior for which they were originally incarcerated –– only 4.9 percent of sexual offenders released from prison between 1992 and 2010 were convicted for a sexual offense again. For some, this creates disputes about how the DOC treats sexual offenders after being released from custody.“It is a very controversial issue this issue of registration,” Dreschel said. “Whether somebody who serves their specified sentence for committing their crime, nevertheless, continues to be under supervision even beyond that date.”However, Knutson called Wisconsin's protocols balanced in comparison to other states with more radical Halloween requirements. A federal judge in Georgia ruled a local sheriff violated the constitutional rights of registered sexual offenders by placing a sign reading: ""WARNING! NO TRICK-OR-TREAT AT THIS ADDRESS!!"" in front of their homes Tuesday. “Whether the media does stories on this or not –– whether people are paying attention or not –– we are always going to do our jobs, and that is making sure the registrants are telling us where they live, work and go to school, making sure they are abiding by their rules of supervision and getting the treatment they need,” Knutson said.

For the safety of myself and all of the other students and Madison residents that live in the Central District area of the city, I believe it is utterly irresponsible of the Madison Police Department to remove this critical position that fosters trust between Langdon residents and the police department itself. Just in the last week there was a shooting on Langdon Street, just a few hundred feet from where Greek life students were running a late-night grilled cheese philanthropy event, while multiple other Greek organizations held social events nearby. While the altercation occurred and nobody was fatally injured, this event makes it blatantly clear to Langdon residents and those in the surrounding area that violent crimes are still occurring on Langdon, endangering the lives of all that live nearby. Katie Hise, a member of the Gamma Phi Beta Sorority on campus who was at the fundraiser, recalls the events as they transpired. “I heard and saw the whole shooting situation happen. I was terrified and was wondering why no one was doing anything,” Hise stated. “When I saw the police cars I felt an immediate sense of relief and safety, the Langdon police officers have always been so protective of us and wouldn’t let us be in harm’s way.”Students on Langdon love Officer Figueroa, the Madison Police Department neighborhood police officer in charge of Langdon Street and trusted resource for the entirety of the UW-Madison Greek community, and his team. We trust that he is there to protect us, and bring every student living on Langdon a sense of peace knowing that it is his sole job to be there if any risky situation should occur.While gun violence is a larger issue in itself in Madison, sexual harassment, dating violence, sexual assault, groping and stalking frequently occur in the Langdon neighborhood. As reported from the Madison Police Department’s 2018 Annual Report, the Central District — which covers both State Street and Langdon —shows that in addition to having the highest number of Drug/Narcotic Offenses and Forcible Sex Offenses, Central District has the second highest number of Assault Offenses, Burglary,Damage to Property and Weapon Law Violation Offenses. These are not numbers to be taken lightly. In 2018 alone, when only considering the reported Forcible Sex Offenses, there were 55. That is 16 above the second highest District (East District at 39 offenses reported). 55 people were violated, and 55 people’s lives changed forever.As found from the newly released Association of American Universities Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, a survey filled out by nearly 20 percent of the undergraduate and graduate students in February of 2019, one in four women on the UW-Madison campus have personally experienced sexual assault. Nearly 26.1 percent of undergraduate women respondents reported having experienced a sexual assault since entering college.This number is appalling, and it doesn’t make any of our students safer to remove a police officer from an area that is one of the most densely populated hubs on campus for social events and potentially risky situations.I am not the only one that feels this way. Maya Parks, a sophomore in Alpha Epsilon Phi also shares feelings of fear, anxiety and unease with this decision.“With the removal of the Langdon officer position I am feeling mostly fear and anger. I am fearful of what that means for my safety. I am the type of person that has people walk me places at night, doesn’t use headphones when walking alone and texts to make sure my friends got home safely. Having an officer specifically for Langdon helped me feel safer,” Parks said. “I am also angry because I can’t grasp the justification behind the removal of the position. The amount of people that live on Langdon, especially the amount of female students, makes me question if the police actually have our best interests at heart.”Another student, Katie Keith, a sophomore in Alpha Epsilon Phi who will be living on Langdon for a second year in a row, shares the same concerns. She is scared because she knows that she will not feel nearly as safe as she does this year, stating that “it is imperative we have extra security on a street so highly targeted and populated.”While it is the Madison Police Department that ultimately made the decision to reallocate their resources, this is largely due to budget cuts determined by the Mayor’s Office in the 2019 City of Madison budget to make room for different, city-wide projects.While we are not trying to discredit the importance of completing these city-wide projects, it is crucial to also consider the safety of the residents of one of the most highly populated neighborhoods in Madison. If Langdon residents aren’t here to walk on improved roads, what good do these roads do?As Officer Damion Figueroa so eloquently reminds all students on Langdon, if we ever need anything, if we ever are a victim of a burglary or an assault, or we see anything that makes us feel unsafe in the area, he is there for us.We already have a resource that is dedicated to the highly student-populated area that is Langdon Street. We already have someone whose sole job is to facilitate relationships with students, and maintain a safe atmosphere for us to get the best education from a highly regarded institution like UW-Madison. We already have an official protecting us so we can socialize with our fellow peers in a casual setting, to enjoy the campus culture, and ultimately to explore and grow as young adults. We already have somebody that has our back — always.The students of UW-Madison that live on Langdon are still here, and we are important. Our safety and sense of comfort in our homes is being toyed with by the mayor’s budget and Madison Police Department as if our concerns are nonissues. Our concerns are important and valid. Nobody on Langdon wants to be another name in a report or another number on the Police Department’s 2019 Annual Report.Our experiences and our fears are valid, and as one of the most highly populated neighborhoods in Madison, our voices deserve to be heard. The City of Madison and the Madison Police Department work for us. Students will continue to fight this, and we will win, for our safety and the safety of the students after us.Brooke has since called and emailed the Mayor and her staff and has yet to hear back about an official meeting time. Any students with further concerns should continue to call the Mayor’s office and make their voices heard.Brooke is a sophomore majoring in sociology and gender and women’s studies, with a certificate in global health.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/10/wiscard-changes-aids-crises-support,"October 18, 2019 | 2:19pm CDT","The Wiscard we all have grown accustomed to is facing some potential changes for the upcoming freshman class. The Associated Students of Madison proposed on October 2 to add crisis hotline numbers on the back of incoming freshmen’s Wiscards. The numbers that are planned to be added are the UW Police Department phone number, University Health Services Mental Health Crisis Line and Rape Crisis Line. California has already implemented legislation that requires middle, high school, and college student IDs to include the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. This change was prompted four years ago when Palo Alto High implemented this hotline on ID cards after a student at the school took their own life. The idea behind the law is to give students a clear understanding that immediate help is readily available — the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a network of local crisis centers, provides free and confidential support on a 24/7 basis. As someone who went to high school in California, I have experienced first hand having student IDs with such hotline numbers present. I personally felt a sense of progress that our government and political leaders are taking into account the lives and wellbeing of students, as this addition to ID cards can be a lifesaver for many students. At first glance of the ID card, most of my friends and classmates did not even notice it. After students began to recognize the addition of the hotline number, no one seemed to have any complaints either. Most students at my school were in fact appreciative of the number being present, for it gave them hope that progress is being made to encourage and normalize the act of reaching out for help. Mental health issues and sexual assault incidents are known to be prevalent in the UW-Madison community. In 2017, UHS provided 2,432 individual counseling sessions, 137 accompaniments or advocacy appointments, 102 unique students by providing confidential, trauma-informed services (individual counseling, group counseling, advocacy, or information about rights and resources), and provided other resources to 237 individuals. Also, 126,757 students had patient/client visits for mental health and sexual assault. Students are certainly using UW-Madison’s resources, but it is not necessarily enough. Last year, 300 cases of sexual assault were reported. And these are only reported cases — who knows what the amount of unreported sexual assaults was. In 2015, UW-Madison was one of the 27 institutions to participate in the Association of American Universities (AAU), Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Assult Climate Survey. Nearly 9,000 UW-Madison students were surveyed, uncovering that one in four women and one in 18 men were sexually assaulted as undergraduate students. Of those reported assaults, 12.6 percent were females experiencing “nonconsensual penetration by force or incapacitation” — and most assaults were reported to have happened during the victims’ freshman or sophomore years. Of these assaults, most took place in residence halls, and most were committed by attackers who were known to the victims. Of these students who experienced penetration by force, only 26.1 percent reported the incidents. This study is based upon 2015 data but does give a baseline of the magnitude of unreported sexual assault instances at UW-Madison. For many students, it is difficult to reach out for help. Students struggle, from the stress of class, pressures of personal life, to extracurriculars like clubs and sports. It becomes even more of an obstacle when attempting to reach out to a loved one, TA, or counselor on top of everything else. Especially for incoming freshmen, most of whom have never lived on their own, and no longer have anyone forcing them to go to class or complete homework, this can be quite challenging. It is even harder for students to reach out about their mental health and sexual assault on top of adjusting to the responsibilities and the new elements of college life. The implementation of these hotline numbers on the Wiscards will not only make these numbers easily available, but can also offer a sense of community acceptance around reaching out. Every UW-Madison student has their Wiscard on them at all times. We use it throughout the day, so having these hotline numbers on the card will make these services apparent and present in our everyday lives. Hopefully, this provides a sense of acceptance within the community and those seeking help do not feel ashamed for using UHS services or calling these hotline numbers. Diminishing the negative stigma around using these services through a widespread acceptance of these hotline numbers will also make students feel more comfortable to reach out for help on behalf of another student. Some might propose that having these numbers displayed on the Wiscards will shock and potentially trigger students who have been assaulted. An important part of accepting the use of these resources is perceiving the accessibility of these numbers in a positive manner. These hotline numbers should be accepted —the use of them should not be met with shame, but with acceptance and support. Although adding these hotline numbers is a step in the right direction, it is not everything. Making the call is the first step, but supporting students who seek out these services is necessary for an inclusive student body. Anthony is a Freshman studying Journalism. How do you feel about potentially adding crises numbers to all Wiscards? Do you think this could decrease stigma regarding mental health and survivor services?

The Association of American Universities released the second Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct Tuesday. The report compares data collected from the 2015 survey and data from 33 schools nationwide to data from the 2019 survey. Undergraduate women reported the highest rate of sexual assault at 26.1 percent, which is about one in four. Blank expressed that the stats collected from the survey were distressing and this issue needs cooperation of both staff and students. “Anything I do on Monday in Bascom Hill ends up having limited effects on Friday and Saturday night on campus,” Blank said. “This is something we have to work together on.”Blank also addressed the reported relationship between alcohol consumption and sexual assault. “I am generally concerned about the level of binge drinking on this campus — it’s implicated in sexual assault issues, it’s implicated in crime, it’s implicated in health issues and academic success,” Blank said. “This is what we have to work across the board.” Improvements since 2015 include an increase in understanding of sexual assault, where to report and who to go to for help following a sexual assault incident. UW-Madison students had higher averages for all three categories compared to all other institutions surveyed. Blank emphasized integrating students in the decision-making process, especially in combating sexual assault on campus. “We want students to be engaged in the conversation of what should we do next,” Blank said. “There are forums and dates that have been announced where we hope to have conversations with you.”Along with expanding resources for sexual assault and misconduct surviors, Blank also addressed mental health resources through University Health Services. Through increased funding, UHS has expanded mental health services through the addition of 13 new counselors. The second recent report Blank discussed was the STARS report — the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System that scores institutions using various categories: academics, engagement, operations and planning and administration with additional points awarded for innovation and leadership. The compilation of the STARS report took more than 150 members working eight months. UW-Madison received a silver ranking, which is typical for first-time participants.  Blank is optimistic about collaboration between staff and students to improve UW Madison’s STARS ranking. “We will have to put in time, energy and resources into in order to move this forward,” Blank said.

Undergraduate women reported the highest rate of sexual assault at 26.1 percent, but this was a statistically insignificant change from the 2015 survey’s report of 27.6 percent.Chancellor Rebecca Blank called these numbers “distressingly high — and even a single incidence of sexual assault is too many.” Twenty percent of campus participated in the AAU Campus Climate Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, in line with 2015’s response rate of 22.2 percent. Four years ago, 60.5 percent of respondents were female, versus 64.7 percent this year. The report weighted the responses based on the demographics of UW-Madison’s total student population. Among other gender groups, 6.8 percent of undergraduate men, 13.1 percent of female graduate or professional students and 3.8 percent of male graduate or professional students reported experiencing sexual assault. For TGQN students — transgender, genderqueer or nonbinary, questioning or not listed — the survey found 28.4 percent reported experiencing an assault. LGBTQ+ students at UW-Madison experience sexual assault at a higher rate, a statistic that has remained steady from 2015 to 2019. This year’s survey found that 22.5 percent of LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing sexual assault since starting college, compared to an overall rate of 13.7 percent for heterosexual students. The report also found alcohol to be a common factor in the sexual assaults of women, as 78.8 percent of respondents reported that someone involved in the assault was drinking prior to the incident. Just over 90 percent of respondents said they were drinking prior to the assault, a number on par with AAU’s national average.  However, something that has improved from 2015 is the percentage of students with knowledge of UW-Madison’s resources for sexual assault victims. Just over a third — 34.6 percent — of students knew where to go for help at the university in 2015, and this year the number increased to 45.8 percent of students who claim to know this information. After the release of the 2015 AAU survey, UW-Madison instituted new programming as a response, Blank wrote in the report. The university hired more staff in the Title IX Office and University Health Services and mandated prevention training for all faculty, staff and graduate students, along with adding a required in-person training for undergraduates. UW-Madison will use the new survey results to change campus programs and policies again, Blank said. The university will be hosting campus forums in November to hear feedback from the public. UW-Madison’s summary of the survey results list several next steps: hiring an additional counselor in UHS Survivor Services, adding a case manager position in the Title IX Program, supporting a trauma-informed care initiative at UHS and using the clinical data from Survivor Services to look for areas of need for students on campus. The university also plans to apply for membership in the National Association of Student Personnel Administrators’ Culture of Respect Collective, which helps participating institutions with self-assessment and organizational change to address sexual violence on campus. “Reducing sexual violence at UW will require changes in behavior and culture as well as in resources and the campus environment,” Blank wrote. “We are committed to doing all we can to ensure a safe living and learning environment for all of our students.”",New Campus Climate Survey reports 26 percent of UW-Madison undergraduate women experience sexual assault,UWM

Some students participated in the “You Are Not Alone” 2019 event last week, which was started to show support for people dealing with the trauma of sexual harassment and assault. One student, however, has been standing daily at the center of campus. For the past five weeks, UW-La Crosse senior Kendra Whelan has been out in front of the Hoeschler Tower around noon, holding a sign that reads “UWL protects predatory professors,” WIZM News Talk reported. Whelan told WIZM she found the university’s response to the allegations to be lacking.“When I realized [the chancellor] wasn’t going to turn this into an open conversation about how we can make our policies better and stronger and protect students, I just couldn’t take it anymore,” she said.Whelan started a petition for UW-La Crosse Chancellor Joe Gow to host an open forum for students to ask questions and “begin healing the broken trust between the administration and the student body.”However, Gow is hesitant to schedule an open forum because of the ongoing investigation into the recent allegations, according to the La Crosse Tribune.“[T]he challenge is you would have to talk without referring to specific cases, and that would be risky,” Gow told the Tribune. “There’s just too much at stake with that.”The university is working on adding information about UW-La Crosse’s commitments to Title IX and the Clery Act to its website to help inform students another way, Gow told WIZM. Whelan told the Tribune she’s received lots of support for her protest, and other students have joined in, including Bailey Click, who participated in the “You Are Not Alone” event. “It’s been really eye-opening,” Click said of protesting with Whelan, according to The Racquet Press. “What I can say to people is if you believe what we believe, please help us and join us.”Whalen plans to deliver the petition to Gow on Oct. 14, according to a post on the petition’s change.org page.

The legislation — introduced by Rep. Yogev Ben-Yitschak and co-sponsored by eight other representatives and one committee chair — intends to add the UW Police Department phone number, University Health Services Mental Health Crisis Line and Rape Crisis Line on Wiscards before the start of the next academic year.Over 200 universities around the country have added emergency service contact information on their university-issued student IDs. In fact, the state of California passed a law requiring institutions to have the National Suicide Prevention Hotline on IDs for middle school, high school and college students. According to UHS, one out of five students at UW-Madison consider suicide at some point, and more than 300 cases of sexual assault were reported during last year. The emergency services contact information is only the beginning of the student health, safety and wellbeing conversation that ASM is initiating with the university staff. Many of the student representatives pointed out that mental health issues and sexual assault incidents are a real concern for UW-Madison students.“Freshman are adults, and we have other resources they are required to go through to prepare them for drinking on college campuses, sexual assaults on college campuses,” said Rep. Dylan Resch. “We get Wisc Alerts of active shooter and attacks by College Library.”One concern raised by representatives was whether having emergency numbers visible at all times would be disturbing or triggering for students. However, Ben-Yitschak said there is not evidence to support that.“The institutions that have the Suicide Hotline and the Crisis Text Line on their student IDs don't see the research that more people have triggering feelings from seeing the number,” Ben-Yitschak said. “That’s something that the State of California did research on before passing the state bylaw about this, and their committee did not find that having the number would cause people to feel more suicidal.” ASM chose to postpone voting on the issue until the next meeting to give representatives more time to do research and “have a more informed discussion next week,” ASM Chair Laura Downer said. Adding the three emergency numbers would not create additional costs for the university, according to discussions with university staff. However, some representatives were still reluctant to greenlight any changes. “Given that students can save these emergency numbers to their phones and just call 911, what does adding these numbers address?” Outreach Director Aerin Leigh Lammers asked.This question prompted many co-sponsors to share personal anecdotes. Rep. Ben-Yitschak shared his experience as a house fellow and how the SOAR presentations include UWPD numbers but not crisis hotline numbers. “There is a reason we do not add the Rape Crisis Line and Mental Health Crisis Line numbers to those presentations,” Rep. Ben-Yitschak said. “That’s mainly because students would feel uncomfortable if in their first conversation someone would have said, ‘Put these numbers in your phone in case you get sexually assaulted or consider suicide.’”Update 10/4/19 3 p.m.: This story has been updated to more accurately reflect the California law requiring crisis numbers on student IDs.

Quarterback Alex Hornibrook couldn’t make simple plays and his receivers couldn’t find any separation. Running back Jonathan Taylor still had success but faced defenses that knew the Badgers would only throw out of necessity.This year – specifically last Saturday against Michigan – it’s been a completely different story. Quarterback Jack Coan, unlike Hornibrook, is delivering accurate balls and has zero interceptions through three games while receiver Quintez Cephus has added a new element to the Badger offense with his ability to stretch the field.Whether or not you agree with UW’s decision to reinstate him after being found not guilty of sexual assault in August, Cephus’ impact has been undeniable through three games. He has 205 receiving yards and two touchdowns--no other Badger receiver has caught a touchdown this year. Cephus’ game also has an indirect impact on how opposing defenses defend the Badger offense which has allowed Taylor to have a dominant start to the season. Because Wisconsin has an elite running back in Jonathan Taylor, with extra tight-ends and has a stellar offensive line, teams have to stack the box with more linebackers and defensive backs. This means receivers are mostly facing man coverage, which means if Badger receivers can beat their man one-on-one, Jack Coan can make simple throws and reads for big plays. Last season, the Badgers didn’t have a clear X receiver--a tall athlete flexed out wide who’s typically the team’s top receiver. Cephus has been able to get seperation on both short and deep passes this season the Badgers struggled with last year. Against Michigan, Cephus only had two catches but both altered how Michigan approached the Wisconsin offense. Take Cephus’ 28 yard reception on 4 and 2. After a rub play by A.J. Taylor blocked the Michigan cornerback, Cephus blew by the Michigan cornerback and gave Jack Coan an easy throw. Against Central Michigan, Cephus had a 38-yard touchdown catch in which he beat his man one-on-one on a fade. These plays force opposing teams to respect Wisconsin’s deep-passing game. While Cephus has played well, Coan and Taylor’s consistent play has provided Wisconsin’s offense and defense with a needed lift. Because Coan has been accurate on simple completions and his receivers are getting separation, teams can’t crowd the line of scrimmage and dare the Badgers to pass. This means Wisconsin’s already dangerous rushing attack has fewer players to block than it normally would have to. Jonathan Taylor then only has to make a few defenders miss and he can run at the secondary at full speed. This season, Coan has zero interceptions and Taylor has zero fumbles. Too often last season, Hornibrook and Taylor gifted the opposition field position deep in their own territory. This made it much harder on UW’s defense to get stops and shifted momentum away from the Badgers. In the first half of Saturday’s game, the Wolverines started every drive at the 25-yard line or worse. Because of this, a struggling Michigan offense would have to go 75-yards to score which ensured momentum stayed on the Wisconsin’s side.The Badger offense is just different this year, it’s balanced and much more unique than in previous years. Disciplined players along with improved playcalling has led to a dominant start to the year.

The university made this decision to increase financial stability, Fox11 News reported. Since Reach Counseling’s partnership with UW-Oshkosh was funded through grants, re-applying for this grant money each year isn’t something the university can depend on, Associate Vice Chancellor and Dean of Students Art Munin said.“This position needed to be something that we could absolutely know would have ongoing funding,” Munin told Fox11 News. Without Reach Counseling, UW-Oshkosh will have a university employee advising victims of sexual assault and violence. The switch from an external organization to an internal employee is troubling for Reach Counseling Advocacy Director Marianne Radley.“We weren't tied to the university, so we weren't biased in protecting an institution or an organization,"" Radley told Fox11 News. ""And … we weren't mandated reporters. So that’s what students told us, we didn't have to report to the dean or any other entities on campus.”However, UW-Oshkosh said the new counseling employee is not a mandated reporter, so students won’t have to worry about their experiences being shared without consent. The majority of UW System schools handle sexual violence and assault counseling through their universities’ health centers, whose websites also include information about external resources, such as RAINN or a local support service. UW-Oshkosh’s Campus Victim Prevention Program website also lists community resources for survivors of sexual assault, which is where information about Reach Counseling has been moved. The one remaining UW System campus still collaborating with an outside provider of sexual assault and violence counseling is UW-Superior, which uses CASDA — the Center Against Sexual and Domestic Abuse — in partnership with its Gender Equity Resource Center.

The majority of the goals discussed during the meeting Tuesday night zeroed in on the different trainings students and other members of the campus community have to complete for activities like university jobs, Greek life and registered student organizations.ASM Outreach Director Aerin Leigh Lammers, said the training for house fellows at UW-Madison could be improved by encouraging constructive conversations about implicit biases. The EIC also wants to look into the required bias training for Greek life participants and Badgers Step Up!, the required training for RSOs — which ASM Press Office Director Matthew Mittnick, said prioritized alcohol policy, not inclusivity. Another program the EIC is interested in improving is the joint U Got This! training and GetWIse workshop — introduced to prevent sexual assault and dating violence — which incoming freshmen and transfer students have to complete. Although the Gender and Sexuality Campus Center has hosted its own versions of the GetWIse workshop, the EIC discussed how conversations in these programs aren’t always LGBTQ+ inclusive. The EIC would also like to standardize policies of gender inclusivity at campus jobs. At certain customer service jobs, one EIC member reported being encouraged to address customers as “sir” and “ma’am,” requiring employees to make snap judgments about patrons’ gender identities without an option for gender non-conforming people. EIC Chair Adrian Lampron said they are excited to begin work on UW-Madison’s bias training programs. “There's a lot of different areas — including student employment, housing, Greek life, student organizations — where there's training happening already, and we'd just like to see ways that that can be expanded or improved upon,” Lampron said. They also mentioned that these bias training projects could potentially gain momentum with a new Campus Climate Survey coming out in a few months. The results of the previous Campus Climate Survey released in 2017 showed divisions in which groups of students felt accepted on campus. The EIC plans to meet with the people responsible for creating and maintaining each of the training programs, such as Greek life councils and University Health Services.Beginning talks to get these in motion should happen within a few weeks, but it’s hard to know how long it’ll be before measurable change is made, Lampron said. However, they believe improving RSO and Greek life training can be accomplished by this semester or the next. “Some of these ideas and concepts are things that take years to come to fruition, and some of them are things we get done this semester,” Lampron said. “We never really know because it's kind of dependent on other folks, but it's always really exciting to see what incremental change we can do and then what really great things we can make happen in relatively short amounts of time.”Update 9/25/19 4:36 p.m.: This story has been updated to more accurately reflect that these goals were brainstormed, not permanently set.",ASM Equity & Inclusion Committee frames goals to improve training inclusiveness,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/09/as-quintez-cephus-returns-to-the-field-uw-madison-faces-potential-lawsuit,"September 8, 2019 | 7:40pm CDT","Quintez Cephus returned to Camp Randall for the first time since October 2017 on Saturday, leading UW to a 61-0 win over Central Michigan. But, with the player’s homecoming comes increased legal pressure on UW-Madison.Cephus was expelled last spring after two female UW-Madison students accused him of sexual assault in 2018. The University’s process found that Cephus “more likely than not” violated the nonacademic misconduct code under Title IX, a federal law mandating universities to quickly respond to students and staff who report sexual harassment and violence.Cephus was found not guilty on both counts of second and third-degree sexual assault after a four-day trial in early August. UW-Madison reinstated and reduced sanctions for Cephus following his acquittal. Cephus’ readmission to the university seemed unlikely. Three expelled students requested re-entry between 2014 and 2018 and none were granted permission, according to university spokesman John Lucas.“My decision is based on the availability of substantial new information that wasn’t made available to us during the earlier process,” Chancellor Rebecca Blank said in a statement. “I recognize that some will disagree with this decision.”And many people did. Most recently, and notably, is attorney John Clune with Hutchinson Black and Cook LLC.As the university faces more questioning from local lawyers on its decision to readmit Cephus, it now has a new opponent: Mr. Clune.While reinstating Cephus may have allowed UW-Madison to avoid a lawsuit threatened by his team of lawyers last October, the university could now face civil action from the women Clune represents — the two UW-Madison students who charged Cephus last year.Clune represented a variety of women in high-profile sexual misconduct cases, such as MBA basketball player Kobe Bryant, MLB baseball player Johan Santana and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. He told the Wisconsin State Journal that UW-Madison did not involve his clients in the process of determining whether to readmit Cephus. In failing to do so, he added, the university “denied them their due process rights under Title IX.”“[The university has] done either a horrible job at explaining their decision-making or they did something illegal,” Clune said. “Right now it looks like both, but that’s what we’ve been hired to find out.”Additionally, Clune said that the university breached the Clery Act, which instructs colleges to do two things:The two female students who indicted Cephus received notification of Blank’s decision to readmit him only moments before the public did, Clune said. By shutting the women out from the reinstatement process, they could now bring a Title IX and negligence lawsuit against the school. The likelihood of legal action from the women depends on how cooperative the university will be in explaining its decision to let Cephus back as a student and athlete. For now, Cephus’ Saturday victory remains applauded by many of his teammates and gameday onlookers.“It was amazing,” Cephus said following the game. “Just getting back to playing at Camp Randall was a special moment.”","As Quintez Cephus returns to the field, UW-Madison faces potential lawsuit",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/08/russell-crowe-gives-the-best-performance-of-his-career-in-the-loudest-voice,"August 29, 2019 | 9:00am CDT","Fox News is one of the most successful media networks in the world. Heavily criticized for featuring controversial commentators such as Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, Fox News has been and remains the most watched news channel in America.The mastermind behind the success of Fox News is none other that Roger Ailes, the polarizing figure who built Fox News from the ground and targeted the conservative base of America for its viewership. Ailes was without question a power-hungry, controlling influencer who had a staunch determination in not only becoming one of the most powerful individuals in the entire media industry, but by channeling his conservative views to the world.Ailes was voted by the executive board of Fox in 2016 to step down from the role of CEO due to a large number of sexual assault and harassment allegations that dated back to the very beginning of his time with Fox. He later died a few months afterwards from a brain injury. Showtime adapts the New York Times reports on Ailes and Gabriel Shermann’s bestselling book “The Loudest Voice in the Room’ about how Ailes built Fox News and influenced American politics heavily in doing so in the mini-series “The Loudest Voice.”Leading the series is the masterful Russell Crowe, who portrays Ailes with such ferocity and vigor that it becomes intoxicating to witness. Crowe gives the absolute best performance of his career, demonstrating the versatile abilities he has as an actor. There are a few scenes throughout the seven-part series where Crowe delivers a line so perfectly, shouts so fiercely and commands the attention of the audience so strongly that we feel as if we’re watching the resurrected Roger Ailes himself. This is a show that belongs to Crowe and who carries every episode and every scene beautifully. He is absolutely flawless and unfiltered in his performance and depicts such a controversial figure with raging confidence. The fact that the same actor who played Maximus in “Gladiator” nearly twenty years ago can play an overweight, old-aged businessman is a testament to the talent of Russell Crowe. The series not only depicts how brilliant Ailes was in his creation of Fox News, but also how manipulative and controlling he was of his employees and the psychological abuse he caused to his female employees, many of which he sexually assaulted and harassed. Most notably is Gretchen Carlson, whose brave legal takedown of Ailes sparked the modern “Me Too” movement and forever changed the environment surrounding the workplace. The outstandingly talented and beautiful Naomi Watts gives yet another terrific performance as Gretchen Carlson. While her character is underused for most of the series, Watts is able to bring a dominating force to her role that is impossible to turn away from. Given that Watts is terrific in every role she plays and is able to generate so much raw emotion effortlessly, the series is misguided in limiting how much we get to see of her.Sienna Miller also does fantastic work in portraying Roger Ailes’ naive and fiercely loyal wife Beth. The marriage between these two had a lot of potential to be further explored, but for the most part Beth is seen as Roger’s toy, another woman he has complete dominance over, yet one who doesn’t seem to have any issues with it. “The Loudest Voice” struggles with its style. Virtually whenever anyone is introduced we get a freeze-frame with the title and brief bio of the real-life figure being introduced, which after episode one feels corny. The editing is very strong in that its able to bring scenes together very neatly and orderly, but every episode feels too much like a depiction of real-life events, taking us away from any authenticity of storytelling.Despite the errors, “The Loudest Voice” is a fascinating piece of television. Roger Ailes is portrayed honestly through his words and actions, a man who, while arguably one of the most brilliant businessmen and influencers in modern history, was undeniably sexist, manipulative, racist and dishonest. Whether that be the infamous abuses he committed towards women, his fear-mongering tactics that made Fox News so addicting to watch or his bias media strategies that favored conservatives, Ailes was a morally-flawed, yet widely successful mastermind whose legacy will no doubt live on forever. Shining on how Ailes influenced the Trump victory through his coverage on Fox, “The Loudest Voice” connects the past to the present and honestly admits how successful Ailes was in achieving his goals. The series knows exactly what it wants to say about Ailes and has a cast that is completely on board with the visions of their characters, an arrangement that allows this show to not only be superbly entertaining, but vitally important.

In a statement from university officials, UW-Madison emphasized their intention to follow proper guidelines while coming to their decision. Chancellor Rebbecca Blank noted in the statement the university recently received new information regarding the case that helped inform their decision. “All three of the primary participants in this case are our students, and I know the past year has been painful for everyone involved,” Blank said. Blank emphasized in her statements the university received previously undisclosed information following the criminal procedures that aided in their decision-making process.  “My decision is based on the availability of substantial new information that wasn’t made available to us during the earlier process.

Despite public dismay regarding the make-up of the jury — eight white women and six white men — the defense team was able to successfully tell Cephus’ story. During his testimony, Cephus argued that the women had engaged in consensual sex due to a number of factors, like making plans to hang out after they left the bar, taking off their own clothing once getting to his apartment and asking to have a sleepover. Cephus faced backlash in trial regarding a photo taken during the threesome by his teammate, Danny Davis, who was called to testify by the prosecution. He said that since he had never been in a threesome before and wanted Davis to see, Davis took a photo of one of the girls who was naked.Cephus initially told police that he was the one who took the photo to protect his teammate. Davis was suspended for the first two games of this football season.  However, Cephus further justified his overall participation in the incident by stating he drove one of the women home to Sellery Residence Hall after they had sex to ensure her safety. The two 18-year-old women involved initially told the police that on the night of the incident on April 22, 2018, they were both too intoxicated to consent to sex after leaving the Double U bar. One mentioned that she did not know how she got back to her dorm room that night.

The dismissed charges can still be considered by the court until Sept. 4.Winslow, 22, pleaded not guilty to five felonies in February after being arrested in connection to a violent attack on a 19-year-old UW-Madison student.Police chief Mike Koval called the case “egregious.” Koval further expressed his disappointment that Winslow was released back into the community with so many previous charges.""This person has had opportunities. No more. No more,"" Koval told the press in February.Police believe Winslow lunged at the victim, punched her and dragged her away from the road, according to the criminal complaint.

But the System’s move to join a national coalition of colleges fighting these issues sparked both praise and criticism from faculty and students alike.In an effort to lower rates of sexual assault and harassment on campuses and provide students with more accessible resources, the UW System joined the Action Collaborative on Preventing Sexual Harassment in Higher Education last week. The initiative’s goals are to raise awareness against and prevent sexual harassment, share and assess current institutional policies, provide research results across institutions and develop a way to measure progress made toward reducing sexual harassment. Being the first statewide school system to join the project, the hope is that UW System’s decision will encourage more action on sexual assault and harassment prevention across the country.“I think that when you have institutions of esteem like UW System who are joining this, it definitely is a statement in terms of how serious these institutions take the review of sexual assault on campus,” UW-Green Bay Title IX Coordinator Christopher Paquet said.Though joining this initiative is a positive step, System employees believe there are still many other factors that must be addressed to prevent these issues.“I’m aware that every campus is doing a lot, but it’s a bigger societal issue, and we have a long ways to go in getting everyone more educated in terms of what is sexual assault, what consent means, what is the role of bystanders,”  UW-La Crosse Violence Prevention Specialist Ingrid Peterson said.Concerns about the effectiveness of the coalition stem from a need to cover a wide variety of different needs across System campuses and other universities across the country. “Every campus is different and has different needs and different rates of sexual assault.  Broadening it takes away from what this campus needs to focus on in terms of minimizing sexual assault,” said Saja Abu HakMeh, the incoming chair of Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment at UW- Madison. “Putting it out there that the System is doing this on a national level is important, it just shouldn’t to a point where they’re not actually taking action, just saying they are.”Others believe the coalition has the potential to make a positive change, but the expectations and aims of the project are still unclear.“I think if coalition has more expectations and clear roles that universities that join it have to maintain then it could be a good thing in terms of making the System as a whole move forward with actions to prevent sexual assault and support survivors who have already experienced it,” said current PAVE Chair Ciara Michel.One outcome the System hopes from joining the coalition is an increase in resource sharing research across campuses, as well as giving a voice to all campuses when discussing ways to address these issues.Campuses will hopefully now have more access to data to know how effective their sexual assault and harassment prevention measures are, as well as increased education on training and tracking resources, Paquet said.With national changes to Title IX legislation currently discussed by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, there is hope this coalition will protect universities from having to conform to these modifications. “This will allow us to not be so beholden to those regulations and actually have some uniform best practices that the system adheres to as opposed to waiting around for any administrative changes to happen,” Paquet said. While there are some concerns from student groups about the changes that may result from joining the initiative, the decision seems to be a step in the right direction in terms of limiting sexual assault and harassment on college campuses. “It is important to have prevention and action taken on all levels, including collaboration between UW System schools and campuses across the nation,” Michel said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/05/freedom-of-choice-brings-abortion-advocates-to-capitol,"May 25, 2019 | 9:18pm CDT","When Mara Jarvis from the National Organization for Women’s Madison chapter heard about Alabama’s new law banning most abortions, she felt the need to act. After sending out a message to a handful of her friends and fellow organizers, Jarvis pulled together a Madison rally in about a week, she said. Protests of abortion bans and restrictions happening across the country drew hundreds of participants of all ages on May 23. Jarvis and other organizers picked the date and time before the nationwide #StopTheBans rallies were announced two days earlier, but she said she was still impressed with the turnout on the steps of the Capitol.“I wanted to empower people and to show people that they're not alone in this fight,” Jarvis said. “I wanted to show the Capitol or show people there that we're not going anywhere. We're still here; we're still fighting.”A large number of men also showed their support at the rally, including 67-year-old Al Hutton. He said he attended because he believes politicians should stay out of women’s medical decisions. “I have a sister and an ex-wife and a daughter and a granddaughter, and decisions that need to be made about their health care, I want [them] and their doctor to make,” Hutton said. “I don't want Senator Johnson or [Assembly Speaker] Robin Vos or anybody like that making decisions.”Many of the speakers at the protest emphasized that abortion is also more than just a women’s issue, as some transgender and non-binary individuals can also become pregnant. “I wanted to make it very clear that this is not just a women's issue, that it's a trans person's issue, that it's a non-binary person's issue. It's an everyone issue,” Jarvis said. “Abortion is for everyone because if a person doesn't get an abortion, that affects everyone, how their family is.”Abortion is an issue of health care, according to rally attendee Michelle Lemech, a 47-year-old nurse and genetic counselor. She spoke of her concerns about the maternal mortality rate in the United States, which is the worst in the developed world and disproportionately affects women of color.The Alabama ban is poised to challenge Roe v. Wade — the 1973 case legalizing abortion across the nation — in the Supreme Court, and Jarvis said risks to pregnant individuals will only increase if the landmark case is overturned. This is because people seeking to end a pregnancy will just do so illegally and unsafely, she said. “The thing about abortion is it's not going anywhere. It was there long before Roe v. Wade, and it'll be here for the rest of time,” Jarvis said. “Whether it is safe and legal is the issue, so we need to push our representatives to make sure that it is.”Several local representatives were in attendance, including Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, and Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison. Jarvis also read a statement from Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway, who wasn’t able to be at the rally. “I will fight with my colleagues at every level of the government to support, protect and expand reproductive rights, including access to comprehensive and safe and legal abortions,” Rhodes-Conway’s statement said.Sargent said standing up for reproductive rights is “morally imperative” because the decision belongs to the individual. “We know that people must be able to make their own health care decisions, including decisions about whether and when to become a parent,” Sargent said. “We know that each person has their own individual story ... we need to honor that people are going to make the best decision for themselves.”During Taylor’s speech, she referenced a group of bills passed by the state Assembly last week aiming to limit abortion access. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Gov. Tony Evers plans to veto all of these bills. Taylor referred to the proposed legislation as “bogus, BS bills that did nothing to enhance women's health” and expressed her frustration with her colleagues on the other side of the aisle. “We will never take direction from these guys in the Republican party,” she said. “They are the last people on earth who should tell us what we can and cannot do with our bodies.”Republicans who were called out by name at the rally included Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau. Vos, while he has not said if he supports other states’ abortion bans at six weeks into a pregnancy, said he does believe “once there’s a detectable heartbeat, it’s a baby” — which is the basis for such bans. Fitzgerald had previously told WKOW 27 News he did not support overturning Roe v. Wade, but he later changed his position in a Thursday thread of tweets. “Overturning Roe would be a monumental moment for the pro-life movement that I’m proud to be a part of — I want to see that happen,” Fitzgerald tweeted. “I’m looking forward to standing up for life once again by sending the pro-life bills recently passed by the Assembly to the governor’s desk after the Senate passes them in June.”If Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion will become illegal in Wisconsin — even in cases of rape, incest and when the health of the parent is in jeopardy — due to an 1849 law that is still on the books.The reality that this 170-year-old law could soon prohibit Wisconsinites from getting abortions reminds protester David Williams, 69, of a time before Roe v. Wade protected access to the procedure. “I was involved in the pro-reproductive rights struggle back in the late '60s and early '70s, before Roe,” Williams said. “So here, this is like 'Back to the Future.'”For the second half of the rally, protesters participated in a die-in, where they lay on the ground as if dead to represent those who have passed away due to lack of abortion access. During the die-in, attendees had the chance to speak, often sharing their own experiences with abortion, parenthood or sexual assault. Partners of the event — including NOW, Women’s March WI, Madison Abortion Defense and #Fight4Her — helped collect donations for Women’s Medical Fund Wisconsin and the Yellowhammer Fund in Alabama, which provide financial assistance to people wanting abortions who can’t cover the cost. The two-hour rally raised more than $1,500 for the two organizations, according to Women’s Medical Fund Wisconsin. Organizers were pleased with the results of the event, including 22-year-old K.C. Cayo, the western regional director for Women's March WI. However, Cayo still recognized the reality that Wisconsin could pass its own version of an abortion ban.“I know that eventually Alabama and [other states] are going to have to do some reckoning with Roe vs. Wade and the legality or lack thereof of their decision, but I would hate to see Wisconsin follow suit,” Cayo said. “Although it would be really hard with Tony Evers in charge, it would not be impossible.”After a governor vetoes a bill, it requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the Senate and the House to overturn the veto and make the bill a law. Evers’ planned vetoes could theoretically be overturned, but the GOP does not have a two-thirds majority in either chamber.However, the future of abortion laws across the nation is still uncertain for Williams.“It's going to be a historic fight,” he said. “Just like the American Civil War.”",Freedom of choice brings abortion advocates to Capitol,UWM

The incident took place during Professor Ralph Grunewald’s class, “Criminal Justice in America” — an introductory class for mostly freshmen and sophomores majoring in Legal Studies — when a guest speaker walked into the class and spoke on his incarceration as a convicted rapist. According to UW-Madison News and Media Relations Director Meredith McGlone, the guest speaker was an ex-felon who now works for re-entry programs at non-profit organizations and was invited to the class for educational purpose.A student who attended the lecture said, without knowing the speaker’s specific offenses prior to the lecture, it could threaten a number of students’ feelings of inclusiveness and safety on campus. “I felt completely outraged that without any trigger warnings [prior to the lecture] somebody who is a convicted rapist was going to come in to speak to our class,” an anonymous student who attended the lecture said, “And [he] has the opportunity to be around girls at the same age as the girl whom he has assaulted.”According to university officials, Grunewald sent out general alerts on potentially sensitive content in class, but not a specific warning on the guest speakers’ offenses. “In this particular case, the professor was not aware of the specific offenses that this speaker had been convicted of. He also did not know that the speaker planned to share that to the class,” McGlone said. “The instructor will stress in the future that alerts on potentially distressing content will pertain to guest speakers as well.”After leaving class early, the student met with UW-Madison Assistant Dean of Students Kathy Kruse to express their disappointment, while also searching for a better sense of safeness in class. “I need an apology from him for making people feel victimized again, and I don’t think there should ever be a platform for a rapist to be in a class especially without an explicit warning,” the student said. “I want to make the noise about not having sexual predators allowed in classrooms as guest speakers.”Further meetings between university officials and the student have been scheduled next Wednesday to continue discussing solutions that advance UW-Madison academic inclusivity. “Any time a concern arises, we encourage students to reach out,” McGlone said. “Discussing the intent and impact of situations like this is an opportunity for both parties to learn and helps improve the overall educational experience at UW-Madison.”Editor's Update: [4/27/19, 10:41 a.m.]: This article previously didn't state the reason the convicted felon was invited to campus, as well as no secondhand quote stated by Kruse from the conversation with the student.

Now, the county is preparing for another summer of floods.Unprecedented late summer rains led to record-high lake levels, flooded homes and more than $154 million in damage county-wide. Following the floods, county officials announced plans to fund more than $18 million in recovery initiatives and studies to prevent future flooding impacts. One of the key takeaways from the fall was that managing water flow in the Yahara Lakes is more important than managing levels of the lakes themselves when it comes to preventing future flooding. Among the strategies, one report identified sediment and weed removal and dam infrastructure improvements. A multi-year dredging campaign, which one common county official estimates will cost around $2 million, is a top priority for the city and will commence in select locations this summer.-Sydney Widell, News Manager2.  UW-Whitewater leadership thrown into question When former UW-Whitewater Chancellor Beverly Kopper stepped down from her post, she recognized the predicament she was in: Allegations of sexual harassment against her husband, accusations of a hostile work environment under her leadership, a community demanding her resignation. The question is, was it fair?On September 14, former UW-Whitewater Chancellor Beverly Kopper’s husband, Pete “Alan” Hill, was revealed to have sexually harassed faculty and students at the university since 2017 — potentially up to 10 women in total. In the days following, Kopper was hit with backlash from the local community, including faculty who said she created a “hostile workplace environment.” Often, staff reported feeling like they couldn’t bring their concerns forward. She sent her single sentence resignation to UW System President Ray Cross, effective Dec. 31. The investigative report found Kopper may have known about his behavior, however she said that it was “rampant with speculation.” - Robyn Cawley, College News Editor3. Badgers wide receiver charged with sexual assault, awaiting trialAfter being expelled and dismissed from the university football team due to sexual assault allegations, receiver Quintez Cephus is found not guilty. Quintez Cephus, a wide receiver for Wisconsin’s football team, was suspended in August after two women accused him of sexually assaulting them while drunk in April 2018. Cephus and his lawyers denied any wrongdoing and unsuccessfully moved to have one of the charges against him dropped. He has pleaded not guilty to the two counts of felony sexual assault, which carry a maximum combined penalty of 30 years in prison. The trial was scheduled to begin Feb. 11, but was delayed after the judge determined it was “not ripe for trial.” The trial is currently scheduled to begin July 29.- Jon Brockman, City News Editor4. Campus, community confronts gun violenceCommunity members from across Madison came together to mourn those killed in Saturday's mass shooting.Campus and the community were rattled after a gunman opened fire in a Middleton office building in early September. Students responded to the violence through protest and activism, and called for tighter gun laws. Building on the youth activism that emerged in the wake of the 2018 Parkland High School shooting, UW-Madison student-led group “Our Lives Our Vote” registered more than 50,000 young voters nationally by mid-October, in an effort to represent young voters and hold elected officials accountable for what they view as lax gun laws. Later on in the fall, mass shootings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Thousand Oaks, California, sent shockwaves through campus, and students assembled in prayer and reflection to mourn the victims of those violent incidents several times throughout the semester. -Jenna Walters, Campus News Editor5. Evers lead blue wave overtaking WalkerThe new evers administration is reintroducing sustainability and climate change measures to Wisconsin policy, signifying a return to the state's historic environmental legacy. In a nail-biting election, Gov. Tony Evers triumphed over incumbent Scott Walker. The former state superintendent garnered large swaths of support from Democratic strongholds in Madison and Milwaukee. Dubbing himself the “education governor,” Evers advocated for an expansion of social programs throughout his campaign. Evers named Mandela Barnes his lieutenant governor, making him the first African-American to hold the position in Wisconsin’s history. These elections contributed to the national “blue wave,” which swept the November midterm elections. More locally, Wisconsin saw an additional unexpected power shift in the office of the Attorney General, where Josh Kaul narrowly beat out incumbent Brad Schimel. Since taking office, the three executive powers have attempted to move Wisconsin toward a more sustainable future, deeming 2019 “The Year of Clean Drinking Water.” However, tensions between Evers and the Legislature have halted communication across partisan lines and complicated efforts to pass the biennial budget. -William Husted, Associated News Editor6. Lame duck laws set tone for Evers' AdministrationAfter lame duck legislative bills are deemed unconstitutional in Dane County court, Gov. Tony Evers rescinded 82 appointments made by former Gov. Scott Walker last year. Leading up to Gov. Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul’s Democratic takeover of the executive office, former Gov. Scott Walker called for an overnight extraordinary session, in which he and the Republican-held Legislature passed bills to limit the power of the executive branch before Inauguration Day. Their agenda included blocking the incoming governor’s ability to pull out of state lawsuits without first gaining the approval of the Legislature –– a tactic Walker employed to ensure Wisconsin's continued involvement in the multi-state suit against the Affordable Care Act. Many called the lame duck sessions a GOP power grab, and critics initiated multiple lawsuits to challenge the constitutionality of those bills. In March, a Court of Appeals judge granted injunctions to remove the lame duck laws, but this was swiftly followed by an appeal of the appeal from Republicans. Currently, some of the initial laws have been upheld, but others have been thrown out. The conflict reflects the intensely split government currently serving Wisconsin.-Jessica Lipaz, State News Editor7. UW-Stevens Point saves humanities majorsFive months after introducing proposal to cut six humanities majors, UW-Stevens Point announced plans to keep all degrees intact Wednesday. In Spring 2018, UW-Stevens Point developed its Point Forward proposal — a plan that would eliminate 13 humanities majors due to low enrollment and a focus towards STEM programs. Within days of hearing of the potential major eliminations, students and community members joined forces with the Reclaim the UW protests to combat the cuts and the ideology behind them. Despite calls from activists to fire Chancellor Bernie Patterson, the administration — backed by the Board of Regents — stood by their decision. In October 2019, they salvaged six of the 12 programs, and in April announced that the plan would be scrapped all together. However, the majors could only be saved by a reduction in faculty, along with alterations to the structure of the programs. -Robyn Cawley, College News Editor 8.  Rhodes-Conway defeats Soglin, women win big in city electionsSatya Rhodes-Conway is Madison's next mayor after defeating incumbent Mayor Paul Soglin with a landslide vote. Former Madison mayor Paul Soglin lost his first election as an incumbent, falling in a landslide vote to former alder Satya Rhodes-Conway in April. Rhodes-Conway, the first openly gay mayor in Madison history, beat Soglin by more than 20 percent of the votes. Soglin and Rhodes-Conway emerged as the two candidates after they placed first and second in the crowded mayoral primary election in February. In a city council race between two UW-Madison freshmen, Avra Reddy defeated Matthew Mitnick to take over the seat covering the university’s campus and nearby neighborhoods. Nearly half of the members of the city council opted not to run for re-election, leading to a multitude of new faces in Madison city government. Women also won big in the Madison Metropolitan School Board elections and now hold all seven seats.-Jon Brockman, City News Editor9. #MeTooSexual assault is still a prevalent issue on campus as reported by 1 in 4 women. “We believe Christine Ford. We believe Anita Hill.” These words rang out from a crowd on Langdon Street on Oct. 4, 2018, in protest of Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court and in solidarity with Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against him for sexually assaulting her when the two were in college. Students were divided when Kavanaugh was sworn in to the Supreme Court in early October 2018. Sexual assault continues to be a widespread problem on college campuses nationwide, but the power of the MeToo Movement has forced higher education to find its place in the movement since it went viral in 2017. The MeToo Movement, however, actually began in 2006, founded by Tarana Burke who spoke on campus in March, calling for an increased “commitment to making this community less vulnerable to sexual violence.”     -Gracie Wallner, Features Editor10. After 50 years, Lecrone takes his final bowDirector of Bands Mike Leckrone stands in front of his marching band for the last time after a career that has lasted half a century. At the beginning of the 2018-’19 school year, UW-Madison band director Michael Leckrone announced he would retire at the end of the spring season. He left behind a 50-year legacy at the university. Over the course of his career, Leckrone received various awards for his excellence, including the “Outstanding Bandmaster Award” by the Wisconsin Chapter of Phi Beta Mu and the “Distinguished Faculty Award” by the UW Alumni Club. He has also been inducted into the Wisconsin Hockey Hall of Fame as well as the Wisconsin Football Hall of Fame. He mentored and inspired roughly 15,000 band members over the course of his career. Those students said they wanted his final show to be the best it could be. The UW-Madison community said it will miss his charisma. Corey Pompey will replace Leckrone as the UW-Madison Band Director in Summer 2019.  -Jenna Walters, Campus News Editor",News Editors' most noteworthy picks of 2018-2019,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/04/uw-system-faculty-students-show-hesitant-support-for-sexual-harassment-prevention-collaborative,"April 24, 2019 | 7:38pm CDT","Like many other schools, the UW System has recently installed more measures to prevent sexual assault and harassment. But the System’s move to join a national coalition of colleges fighting these issues sparked both praise and criticism from faculty and students alike.In an effort to lower rates of sexual assault and harassment on campuses and provide students with more accessible resources, the UW System joined the Action Collaborative on Preventing Sexual Harassment in Higher Education last week. The initiative’s goals are to raise awareness against and prevent sexual harassment, share and assess current institutional policies, provide research results across institutions and develop a way to measure progress made toward reducing sexual harassment. Being the first statewide school system to join the project, the hope is that UW System’s decision will encourage more action on sexual assault and harassment prevention across the country.“I think that when you have institutions of esteem like UW System who are joining this, it definitely is a statement in terms of how serious these institutions take the review of sexual assault on campus,” UW-Green Bay Title IX Coordinator Christopher Paquet said.Though joining this initiative is a positive step, System employees believe there are still many other factors that must be addressed to prevent these issues.“I’m aware that every campus is doing a lot, but it’s a bigger societal issue, and we have a long ways to go in getting everyone more educated in terms of what is sexual assault, what consent means, what is the role of bystanders,” UW-La Crosse Violence Prevention Specialist Ingrid Peterson said.Concerns about the effectiveness of the coalition stem from a need to cover a wide variety of different needs across System campuses and other universities across the country. “Every campus is different and has different needs and different rates of sexual assault. Broadening it takes away from what this campus needs to focus on in terms of minimizing sexual assault,” said Saja Abu HakMeh, the incoming chair of Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment (PAVE) at UW- Madison. “Putting it out there that the System is doing this on a national level is important, it just shouldn’t to a point where they’re not actually taking action, just saying they are.”Others believe the coalition has the potential to make a positive change, but the expectations and aims of the project are still unclear.“I think if coalition has more expectations and clear roles that universities that join it have to maintain then it could be a good thing in terms of making the System as a whole move forward with actions to prevent sexual assault and support survivors who have already experienced it,” said current PAVE Chair Ciara Michel.One outcome the System hopes for from joining the coalition is an increase in resource sharing research across campuses, as well as giving a voice to all campuses when discussing ways to address these issues.Campuses will hopefully now have more access to data to know how effective their sexual assault and harassment prevention measures are, as well as increased education on training and tracking resources, Paquet said.With national changes to Title IX legislation currently discussed by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, there is hope this coalition will protect universities from having to conform to these modifications. “This will allow us to not be so beholden to those regulations and actually have some uniform best practices that the system adheres to as opposed to waiting around for any administrative changes to happen,” Paquet said. While there are some concerns from student groups about the changes that may result from joining the initiative, the decision seems to be a step in the right direction in terms of limiting sexual assault and harassment on college campuses. “It is important to have prevention and action taken on all levels, including collaboration between UW System schools and campuses across the nation,” Michel said.

The incident occurred on April 10 when a 15-year-old female student at Madison’s East High School told the School Resource Officer she had been sexually assaulted in a bathroom by two male students. The two students, both age 15, were arrested for second degree sexual assault of a child, a felony carrying a maximum sentence of 60 years.Following the assault, Madison Metropolitan School District safety and security coordinator Joe Balles came under fire after comments he made were deemed inappropriate.“Our buildings are full of kids, and kids will be kids,” Balles told Channel 3000. “As terrible and tragic as that incident sounds, I would just ask that people just be patient. Our schools are very safe but there are incidents that are going to happen from time to time.”Balles’ comments were widely criticized, including by the Madison-based Rape Crisis Center, which called the statement “deeply troubling.”“Statements like the one Balles made to Channel 3000, including the phrase ‘kids will be kids,’ perpetuate a culture that facilitates violence, particularly sexual violence, in our communities,” the RCC said in a statement. “It is never acceptable to minimize any form of sexual assault.”The backlash to Balles’ remarks prompted East High School principal Michael Hernandez to send an apology letter to families of East High students. “I apologize about the statements that were made by the Head of Security last night in the news,” Hernandez said. “We are working with the Rape Crisis Center to problem solve together next steps to provide a safe space for all in our community. There is no excuse for this type of behavior and we will do everything we can to provide it.”Balles also offered his apologies and said in a statement he made “an extremely poor word choice.”“It is never ok to rationalize, minimize or excuse sexual assault, and there is no excuse for my words, which did not recognize the profoundly deep impact that sexual violence has,” he said. “It is my job to ensure schools are physically, mentally and emotionally safe spaces for all. I recognize the deep impact my words had, and I will do better for our students.” ","Madison high school’s response to sexual assault prompts backlash, apologies",UWM

In 2017, within the span of a week, Chung attempted to abduct a woman from the UW-Madison campus, sexually assaulted an unconscious UW-Madison student and attacked another woman while trying to rob her. Chung was sentenced to 22.5 years in federal prison with 15 years of extended supervision after his release, which Dane County Circuit Judge Ellen Berz said may not come if the state decides to confine Chung permanently under Wisconsin’s sexual predator law. “The rest of Mr. Chung’s life will be defined by what he did to you,” Dane County Circuit Judge Ellen Berz told Chung’s victims. One of the victims in the case, who remains unnamed, is currently a sophomore at UW-Madison. When Chung found her passed out near Gordon Dining and Event Center he removed her clothing and recorded himself inappropriately touching her with his iPod.The victim did not know of the assault until police found the videos during an investigation of the other charges and tracked her down. The UW-Madison student said Chung is “everything that is evil and wrong in the world.” She told Berz the incident has taken away her ability to feel safe at school. Just three days after assaulting the unconscious victim, Chung attempted to abduct a different student on Observatory Drive. He grabbed the student, put duct tape over her mouth and tried to force her into his car, but the student was able to escape him. The victim, who also remains unnamed, later told Berz that while she condemns Chung’s actions, she wants to “thank him for making her throw away her fearlessness.” Chung made a statement apologizing to the women. None of his victims had to testify against him in court. ","Man sentenced to prison for assault of two local women, UW-Madison student",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/04/uw-system-joins-national-collective-to-combat-sexual-harassment,"April 14, 2019 | 9:24pm CDT","To prevent sexual harassment, the UW System joined a nationwide initiative alongside 30 campuses Wednesday.The Action Collaborative on Preventing Sexual Harassment in Higher Education is a partnership with National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine compiling evidence-based research and current policies to reduce and prevent sexual harassment on campuses. All 13 System campuses signed separate letters in joining a collective of founding institutions — Harvard University, Northwestern University, the University of Michigan and Yale University.The UW System is the only statewide system working in the collaborative. ""This has affected our faculty, our staff and our students for way too long,"" UW System President Ray Cross said. ""We have to step up our efforts to raise awareness in the workplace and in the classroom.""The goals surrounding the reduction and prevention of sexual harassment from the Action Collaborative are to: raise awareness, boost recognition of evidence-based institutional policies and strategies, compile locations where assault occurs and develop a standard for measuring process. In 2014, Cross created the Task Force on Sexual Violence and Harassment, which centered its attention on current and best practices of sexual harassment prevention over two years. Based on what the task force found, the Board of Regents created a new sexual assault and harassment policy in 2016, mandating sexual violence prevention training for all UW System employees and students. Additionally, they developed a new reference check policy and sharing personnel filed geared toward preventing “pass the harasser” practices. “Ensuring the safety of our students and our employees at every institution is one of the most important responsibilities of the Board of Regents,” said Regent Vice President Drew Petersen. “We strongly support the efforts of the Action Collaborative to help reduce and prevent sexual harassment in higher education.”One of the first topics the coalition aims to tackle is how Title IX looks on college campuses. For example, UW-Milwaukee currently pairs their Title IX coordinator with the campus’ survivor support advocator, resulting in person-to-person training sessions within the university’s Greek Life community. Currently, they have held 15 training sessions, according to Jamie Cimpl-Wiemer, director of equity and diversity services at UW-Milwaukee.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/04/crime-survivors-feel-re-victimized-by-the-wisconsin-justice-system,"April 11, 2019 | 9:00am CDT","""There is no better thing to talk about this week than Marsy's Law,"" Todd Novak, R-Dodgeville, said during a National Crime Victims’ Rights week press conference in the Senate Chambers Tuesday. With increased state recognition after Gov. Tony Evers proclaimed April as Sexual Assault Awareness month –– noting one in three women and one in six men will experience sexual assault –– crime survivors worked with grassroots organizations to urge legislators to constitutionally ensure greater protections and a more victim-centric approach to the justice system.Marsy’s Law for Wisconsin organizers, authors of Assembly Joint Resolution 1 and Senate Joint Resolution 2, the Wisconsin Court Appointed Special Advocates and Attorney General Josh Kaul spoke out in support of survivors to help push the bills onto the legislative floor during Tuesday’s press conference. The proposed legislation would protect crime victims by keeping information like their names, phone numbers and addresses private, as well as improving transparency about their perpetrators’ sentencing status and allowing them to refuse interview requests by the accused. “At Marsy's Law what we are trying to do is even the playing ground –– we are not looking for any special treatment. We are just looking for equal treatment for victims,” Marsy’s Law chair and survivor Teri Jendusa Nicolai said. “Our rights right now are statutory, we need to make them constitutional.”Marsy’s Law is a coalition that builds communities for crime victims and legislators alike, aiming to give survivors equal rights as the ones accused throughout the justice system process.Survivors shared their stories and explained how current laws made them feel victimized by the justice system for allowing the accused to have power over them once again.“I was granted a no contact order, but to get it I had to give the man that had violated me all of my personal information. He had everything,” Gabrielle Stathus said about her sexual assault trial against her 8th grade teacher. “When I was hospitalized with a chronic illness, his defense attorney would call to check on my status.” Gabrielle’s perpetrator was given a plea deal, lowering his initial sentencing from 40 years to six months. In the end, without the say of Gabrielle who was only allowed to speak in the courtroom on one occasion, the the trial never happened. He served only 90 days in prison.  “I started this journey as a powerless child and it ended in being a powerless adult with nowhere left to turn,” Gabrielle said. “Victimized and forgotten by the justice system.” Survivors like Gabrielle are connected to Marsy’s Law through various outreach programs and events. Survivor and advocate Christina Traub said that organizing for Marsy’s Law can help victims get on the path to become survivors. “Giving victims a voice seemed like some insurmountable task when we started,” Traub said. “In the two years that I’ve been involved, any time that I share my story, along the way someone stops me and says, ‘Thank you. Thank you for speaking up when we couldn’t.’”Affiliates of Marsy’s Law expressed the difficulties about coming forward after any kind of assault, highlighting the constant presence of sexual assault victims due to the widespread occurrence. Kate Thalacker, victim and witness coordinator at Marsy’s Law, said that support for advocacy efforts has increased since the rise of the #MeToo movement, allowing victims within the organization to find solidarity.Although she says sexual assault rates have not necessarily gone up, the movement has helped decrease the stigma surrounding coming forward –– no matter how long after the assault the victim chooses to.“I think that with the safety and the safe space that everyone is creating through the #MeToo movement gives people the chance to say, ‘Hey, that's something that happened to me and I want support with it,’” Thalacker said.Although Sexual Assault Awareness month makes now a great time to advocate for crime victims’ rights, Kaul said it is also important to work towards a victim-centric approach to the justice system year-round and with a wider scope –– alluding to a necessary increase of funding. Kaul believes the addition of a state-funded prosecutor dedicated to prosecuting in sexual assault cases, and also assisting with investigations and training, would support this initiative. Evers proposed this position in his biennial budget. “Justice isn't just about punishing people who break the law. It’s also about making sure that we're doing what we can to help make victims and their families whole,” Kaul said. “I think it’s important that we move forward with this and I am hopeful that this will have broad support from both chambers of the legislature.”",Crime survivors feel re-victimized by the Wisconsin justice system,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/03/administration-rejects-proposal-to-implement-sexual-assault-reporting-software,"March 28, 2019 | 11:31am CDT","After UW-Madison’s decision to reject a fully-funded proposal to implement Callisto campus, a software that allows students to report a sexually assault, the Student Title IX Advisory Committee posted their response Tuesday.The Committee became aware of the administration’s decision to reject the proposal in October, but decided to wait until now to issue a statement to ensure they had all the accurate and relevant information and could decide what goals they wanted to reach through their statement, said Manasi Mohan, the chair of STIXA. The committee voiced their concerns, saying their software would help reach their goals of “streamlining the reporting process, supporting and empowering survivors and making our campus safer” in their letter. Callisto allows victims to give a time-strapped record of their assault, identify their victim, and submit a report to administration if, and when, they feel comfortable. According to STIXA’s response letter, the only report form found online is the general Clergy act form, which is buried in the UW Police Department website and inaccessible via the UW-Madison Title IX webpage. “We at STIXA find the current reporting options confusing and fragmented,” the letter states. The Dean of Students cited three main concerns with the Callisto system last April: focuses solely on sexual assault, as opposed to all kinds of sexual misconduct; that it is made for especially for undergraduates; and that it is minimally useful if the victim cannot identify their attacker via Facebook. STIXA addressed and refuted these claims in their letter. According to STIXA members Dom Maderal and Petra Dai Walech, a three-year report from Callisto shows campuses using Callisto have students reporting sexual assaults an average of four months after the incident — as opposed to 11 months after the incident for campuses that do not use the software.Additionally, students who accessed Callisto were six times more likely to report an assault that those who did not. STIXA will continue to use the programs currently in place to provide support to sexual assault survivors and invite administrators to work with the organization to consult with students and discuss what can be done to improve the process of reporting an assault. “Our campus needs to change not only how we talk about consent and assault, but also how we process and support survivors of violence,” Maderal and Dai Walech said in an interview. The Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment group believes the Callisto program would have been beneficial to survivors and was disappointed with the University's decision. ""We support STIXA’s letter and as as organization are disappointed that the university has chosen to not implement a fully funded program to help combat sexual assault and streamline the process of reporting,” said PAVE Communications Coordinator Alex Hader and PAVE Chair Ciara Michel. “This is just another way in which the university has demonstrated their lack of commitment to trauma-informed and survivor-centered programs surrounding sexual violence.” The university has been developing new reporting tools to meet the needs of students and faculty, Director of University News and Communications Meredith McGlone said in a statement. “After several months of additional work, UW is now preparing to roll out a tool called i-Sight this spring, which will help us enhance our oversight of reports from students as well as employees,” she said. They have also created a campus resource guide, updated the Title IX website, as well as streamlined outreach and support options, according to McGlone. While administration appreciated the donor's offer to fund the Callisto system, they did not believe it was the best program for the university. Still, the STIXA feels the university “missed an opportunity to streamline reporting mechanisms” by failing to install Callisto, the letter states. “There is no excuse for an institution like UW- Madison...to not do what is in its power to support survivors,” Maderal and Dai Walech said. “Callisto, or a program like it, is not a leap, it is the next logical step. How long it takes for UW-Madison to take that next step is up to the administration. Students have made their voices heard and we hope the university will listen.”Editor Update [March 29, 2019; 9:10 a.m.]: This article did not previously include quotes from UW-Madison Communications Director Meredith McGlone and did not feature the reasoning why the university passed on the software.",Administration rejects proposal to implement sexual assault reporting software,UWM

The class-action suit by Dr. Maria Fabbrocini against Dr. Robert Pearce and the Regents is on behalf of all female doctors in UW Health’s anesthesiology department since 2013. There are currently 32 female doctors in the department. Fabbrocini’s legal action follows a 2017 university report on the anesthesiology department, which found they need to recruit more female residents, examine gender equity of salaries and identify ways to combat a “male-centric” culture. The report, which was based on a rare “climate review” conducted between February and August 2016, revealed that although the department provides high quality medical care, it is a “good old boy network.” Although Pearce remains a faculty member, he resigned from his post after 10 years in July 2016. The environment is difficult for women, since there are twice as many male faculty as female among the 80 faculty members — and a large portion of the women are part-time, the Wisconsin State Journal found. Female residents are told not to “rock the boat,” pregnant women experience humiliation and the female-dominated American Family Children’s Hospital anesthesiology team are “infantilized” when said to work at “the crying hospital” or “candyland,” the report found. Fabbrocini, who went to medical school and completed her residency at UW-Madison, began working at the hospital in 2008. She alleged she was paid less than her male counterparts, despite having similar skills and workload. She was among the part-time doctors in the department, which are generally female, according to the suit. While in his position, Pearce instituted a policy that ended considering part-time doctors pursuing leadership roles, which stops them from additional administrative pay. He also has a history of not disciplining for ongoing questionable behaviors that “resulted in the serial sexual assault of a multitude of anesthetized female patients by a male physician,” the suit claimed. For example, a male doctor who physically abused women in the department — and attacked Fabbrocini by grabbing her by the throat, shaking her and shouting in her face in 2010 — was not disciplined by Pearce.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/03/students-uw-police-chief-discuss-campus-safety-issues,"March 14, 2019 | 9:39pm CDT","The Wisconsin Union Directorate Society and Politics Committee hosted a roundtable discussion to address campus safety initiatives Wednesday evening.UW-Madison Police Department Chief of Police Kristen Roman discussed with students at Memorial Union various safety topics both on- and off-campus.The event addressed the recent visit to campus by Me Too founder Tarana Burke. In her talk, she emphasized the university’s role in making tangible changes to campus safety, specifically in the case of sexual assault. WUD SoPo Committee Chair Tanvi Tilloo guided the group through a series of open-ended questions about their experiences on campus. Students brought up concerns about rape culture on campus and the challenges that accompany keeping students safe in off-campus areas, where the university may have a lack of discretion. Tilloo said she and other organizers intended for the discussion to foster constructive communication about the issue. “We didn’t want this to be about blaming the university,” Tilloo said. Roman said she wants to do what she can to take an active role in engaging with students about their safety concerns in the future. She also responded to concerns about the lack of reports of abuse from victims, which some students at the discussion said could be due to negative stigma around reporting to police.“I want to send a message that encourages victims to be comfortable reporting to us,” Roman said. “Our role is one of support, providing information, advocacy, prevention and awareness.”Roman said it is important to have discussions about these issues with different members of the campus community because “no entity can do it alone.”“We are a community and in order for us to really promote safety and do the best that we can to ensure safety, we all have to come together,” Roman said. “It’s about empowering students to expect more and to actively roll up their sleeves and make things better.”","Students, UW police chief discuss campus safety issues",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/03/activism-is-a-form-of-survival-a-feminist-conversation-with-amber-tamblyn,"March 13, 2019 | 10:00am CDT","Amber Tamblyn — actress, director and most recently author of “Era of Ignition” — spoke with editors of the Daily Cardinal about her experience in the film industry, developing the Time’s Up movement, and seeking allyship and inclusivity in mainstream feminism. She discusses the importance of coming to the table and having accountability in this ignited era. This is not a choice for women, but a means of survival. When did you decide to write this book? And how long has the topic been on your mind? I started thinking about the book maybe like a year and a half ago. I had wanted to do a collection of essays that really talked about my trajectory in my work, but also didn’t completely focus on that. I kind of feel like anything pertaining to the entertainment business, for me anyway, gets a little boring and monotonous. I knew that there was so much that I wanted to talk about pertaining to my experience as a woman in that business, but then the larger experience of women in any business. And I thought that would make a pretty compelling book in this wild world that we live in right now. When did you first identify as a feminist?I don’t remember, which is a good thing. I grew up around a lot of women who identified as that, and so it’s sort of ingrained in who I am, in my culture and in my life, so it was not something that felt separate for me. It’s taken time to fully recognize what kind of feminist that I was, what kind of person and what that value meant. I think it’s one thing to say that you are that, I think it’s another thing to truly act that out and live the words of the idea of having equality for all women. So I think I definitely always identified with it, I don’t think I fully knew the total impact of what the idea meant up until maybe like several years ago. I think most women come into it in that way. How do you go about avoiding creating this universal definition for feminism, because that happens a lot in the media. How do you go about making sure there’s not this one label of feminism?I think it’s very hard not to, but I believe that to be true of any movement or ideal or belief. Then, I think that, at some point, there is always somebody that is going to say that it’s wrong or it’s not conducive and that it has problems. And, you know what, all of those things are true, especially in feminism. It’s true of everything. It’s true of the civil rights movement, it’s true of religion, it’s true of everything. And that’s okay for those things to be true, I think that’s why Roxane Gay’s “Bad Feminist” was truly revolutionary, because it gave us permission to be flawed. It gave us permission to say that you don’t have everything figured out, you don’t have all these answers. There is no perfect wave. Every wave of feminism is important, has been important, has something to offer. And that we all have, at one point or another, failed and probably hurt somebody in the process of trying to be part of that change. I think owning those mistakes and failures — the blind spots — in places in which is has not been, is the most important thing we can do in changing things going forward, to be really honest. What does intersectionality mean to you and why is this important to movements like Time’s Up and Me Too?Intersectionality is the sub-equality conversation. So while we’re having conversations about equality of men and women on their treatment and how their paid, there’s also the sub-conversation, and there are many versions of that, which is equality within the equality conversation. And so, it’s predominantly white women or affluent women of a higher stature or class where dictating social justice has changed and [are] trying to change the world, but that’s not necessarily the right thing. And so, I think one of the important things that we have to remember is that is not just that we have felt marginalized, it’s not just that we have felt left out of the conversation. There are always other women that feel that moreso. And those women we have to lift up and make sure that their voices are heard. It’s the same thing I would say about, like we can’t have feminism without men. We can’t have it. It should be for for cisgendered women. It should be for non-binary people. It should be for queer men. It should be straight men. It should be for everybody. Like the “bell hooks” books, feminism is for everybody and she meant it. And she was right. I would take it one step further and say that it has to be everybody, because we can’t succeed in any sense of equality unless you have everyone trying to understand the things that they value. Because in the news, it tends to focus more on this idea of mainstream feminism or even just white feminism, how do you work, personally, to make it more inclusive?I think the most important thing we can do is have personal responsibility and personal accountability, so forget what everyone else is doing, right? Forget that. I don’t believe that spending our time policing online and policing on Twitter is necessarily the way to go. I think it’s really important for us to converse and be aware of the ways in which we are failing other people, but then there’s this whole thing of: who do we have access to? Is it our other white girlfriends? Do we have access to them if they are good friends of ours to help them see when they have failed and they have done something racist or when they are just not really getting it. I know I am the person I am today because of my close girlfriends who were not white. These women who loved me enough to pull me aside and say let me help, this is how we do it. And I love that as a way to pass it on to other women so that we’re all doing it. And also passing it onto men so that their doing it too. But I think remembering that we can hold people accountable without cruelty. This idea of mentorship is incredibly important, so to see it more as mentoring our sisters, as blind as they might be, so that we are all uplifting each other at the end of the day. How are you and other members of the Time’s Up movement working to enact change in the film industry, specifically? We’ve been working on that, as you know, Time’s Up is over one year old. And we have been working very hard to make sure that women’s voices are being heard in film and television and not just the stories that are told onscreen, but the people that are creating those stories: the writers, the directors, the women behind the camera, the women working in different departments that create those creative endeavors. So we’ve been working on that for some time and I think also making sure that there is a very safe environment for those experiences to happen. It’s the simple things, like never in our existence as an industry has there been somebody present to coordinate scenes that are intimacy related, so like sex scenes or things like that, if they were making out, or whatever those things might be. And it was just in the last year that they developed this term called an intimacy coordinator. Because when you are doing those scenes, it’s not just less to the devices of the male actor who you’re acting across, and predominantly the male director and the male producers. It always a very uncomfortable situation. And now when you have someone there, it feels so much safer in a lot of ways. I would say that’s one of the really big things. What are some ways to combat the self-doubt women face when going into leadership roles? And fighting the oppressive systems that create the gender roles and positions that are traditionally fulfilled by men?I talk a lot in the book about that and the idea of how do we go from being held in one particular place and boxed into a certain archetype or role and how we can change that. How we can push through the greater oppression whether that’s in the workplace or even personally in our own lives and come out on the other side changed and feeling more powerful about that. I keep going back to this idea of allyship and mentorship and it’s so important for each of us to find those people in the workplace and in our personal lives — we really have to push through the idea that we have to stay where we are at and that we can’t grow or go past anything further from that. One of the best ways to do that is to find people who are like-minded and believe the same things we believe because if we find those people and we create groups or movements or organizations with those people, whatever that is, we can affect a lot of positive change. I think even in schools or universities some much can be changed just by women and getting together with like-minded men and asking them to come support them. Be there with them whether it’s that they want equality, they want there to be less sexual harassment and sexual assault on campus — these are huge issues always for any university or college. That is just not a battle that can be done alone. One of the most powerful things about Time’s Up is that it was exactly that, it was this idea that we realized on our own and it didn’t matter how famous the person was, how powerful the executive was, how much clout the distributor had, as women that we were not going to be enough by ourselves. We had to get together, we had to work to fight for each other and that we were much stronger in numbers. So, I think that’s one of the really great ways that anyone can push through that, any marginalized voice whether that’s again a women, a non-binary person, someone with disability, anyone that has felt boxed or left out of the room. Really work hard to find who your allies are.What is an ally to you? Do you consider it an action or an identity?  I think it can only be an action. I think even in our words, the words can support an action. Right, so it doesn't necessarily mean you have to go and physically show up for something. Some people that’s just not in their nature, they don’t feel comfortable with it and I get that, I think those that want to physically show up for something should and they have to stick their necks out on the line to do that, but I think for other people sometimes it can be just communicating through a friend, it can be saying something with words. Haha, it’s one of the things that I remember when Donald Trump when he was talking about words and how we lost the way to talk. I just shook my head and was like that’s not true. Words are especially tied to action, they are actions. Speaking bigotry, speaking racism, speaking sexism, those affect people, they affect what jobs they get, work they get, their self-esteem. These words can literally manifest and turn into somebody’s suicidal ideation, the power of words is innumerable and we have to take that seriously. And, we have to remember that is so much a part of the action of allyship. So, we should definitely consider that as one of our strongest tools. That’s what we have best to offer.What is your relationship with identifying as a feminist and traditional societal norms that revolve around marriage and family?Well to me, everything is intertwined and deeply rooted in feminism no matter what it is. So any of the work will always come from that whether it is the work I do in my own marriage or whether it is the work I do as a mother or a writer — everything comes from that place. I think it’s so interesting, I’ve always felt like for women activism is not a choice, so, when people always ask me, ‘like how old were you when you got into activism?’ And I’m like I don’t remember. I am deeply tied to it, it’s been a part of who I am forever. I don’t think that women have that choice, I think that for women activism is a form of survival. And that is with any given activism that things are just not there, someone is getting paid more, I’m being abused, I’m being talked down to, whatever the form of it is we react and we act in an activist way. By being a part of that and making sure that we are doing the most that we can and not by choice but either we do that or we are harmed or cease to exist in a certain capacity. I’m constantly reminded of that as an idea. So, I think it’s deeply tied to everything I am. It’s not like I choose it, for this one part of my life and then I don’t for another part. It is everything that I am and everything that I am not. And, that’s just the way that it is.How does your discussions with David and other men work to combat these gender barriers and systemic privilege?Again, I go back to this idea of having these conversations and it’s on each of us do to our part and to know that we are all human beings at the end of the day. The problem is not failing, the problem is not any given man or person failing in their attempt to be better and to no harm people, [but] to see them for who they are to support them. Failure is not the problem, the problem is in not trying, it’s in being this [person] in the stands who is going like ‘well this doesn’t affect me so I don’t have to worry about it’ or it upset me so I am not going to push through and work harder at it. It’s uncomfortable, we always hear about this word, I think being uncomfortable in these capacities — it’s supposed to be uncomfortable. These conversations are type of change in ourselves, again, going back to the accountability model. It’s uncomfortable, you never have a breakthrough where you’re like ‘ah that was really easy, like it didn’t leave me emotionally gasping for air at all.’ It does. It’s supposed to be that way, but even the best of us — I hate the word woke‚ but even the most woke of us have that and have to go through it and comes out on the other side like ‘oh what I did is really shitty and blind.’ And it’s the learning, it’s the trying and learning that is the most powerful thing we have to offer as human beings. But, the not trying is unacceptable, especially in this time. That’s what I believe so much so I always just encourage men to not be afraid to fail with this particular movement and topic and seeing things now, but to know that to not come and meet us at the table, to not try is where the problem is. And that’s when things get difficult and messy. What was the inspiration for ‘Era of Ignition?’ How did you come up with this? And lastly, why did you choose to end with a letter to your daughter?I was trying to find a way to describe what this world is that we are living in right now, which just really feels like a condense, age of change. Radical change and things that feel very chaotic, a world that feels like we don’t know where it’s going to land once it has landed. After this huge detonation that we’ve all felt in the last two years and describing what we do after the chaos, what we do after the palpable rage, which is I believe this ignited era that were in right now. I mean I don’t know a woman whether it’s my sister or my mom or my friends in the entertainment business who are not feeling to some capacity more powerful than they ever felt before whether or not that’s literally true or not. They are feeling very engaged and they are feeling very much like they would do anything they can to change their own lives and see through what they need to see through without asking for permission. So, that’s sort of where the title came from and again, this idea of mentorship and passing on what we most hope for ourselves. Someday if you decide as women to have kids, you don’t have to either is fine, but you’ll feel the same way. You will feel this need to pass on everything that you have learned, the good and bad, most importantly the bad. Learning from the bad is so important for each and every one of us and I really wanted to end the book by gifting that to her. And by hoping that letter to her will resonate with so many women and fathers too, this idea of the gift that we give to our children, which is not all their hopes and dreams and filling them with them with those types of things, but filling them with truth. And, then talking about truth of the world that we live in because with that knowledge and intelligence we come armed to the table. We come armed to the conversation, to any conversation.

Another student said the College of Health Sciences professor, Anthony Azenabor, increased levels of physical contact prior to sexual assault. She feared exposing him would impact her work in her graduate program. After the student was accepted into her Ph.D. program by Azenabor, they began to meet consistently for her research in September 2017, she told the UW-Milwaukee police. He began making sexual comments, initially claiming they were “research-related,” when they would meet in Azenabor’s office or his academic laboratory. The comments led to inappropriate touching and hugs, groping and eventually forced intercourse by May 2018.   The professor grabbed the survivor, “forced her onto his lap and began to rub and touch her inappropriately,” the crime report said. She also spoke of another time when he pushed her onto a bench and raped her. Another student disclosed a “substantially similar conduct” to UW-Milwaukee police, saying he implanted mistrust and anxiety of other faculty members. She said she did not immediately report the misconduct for fear she would not obtain her graduate degree, according to the complaint. Azenabor was charged with two counts of second-degree sexual assault, use of force and one count of fourth-degree sexual assault in offenses that occurred in March, April and May of 2018, as stated in circuit court records. He pleaded not guilty to the fourth-degree charge and was held in custody Monday with bail set at $7,500, as stated in the court records. The records did not include pleas for the second-degree counts. ",Survivors of alleged sexual assault feared repercussions from UW-Milwaukee professor,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/03/me-too-founder-tarana-burke-uw-community-demand-broader-conversations-surrounding-sexual-violence,"March 7, 2019 | 10:46am CST","UW-Madison’s Memorial Union auditorium buzzed with hundreds of students, faculty and community members who awaited Tarana Burke, the founder of the Me Too movement, to speak.Sexual violence is not a new issue on college campuses, but the power of Me Too has forced higher education to find its place in the movement.Burke said in order for students to have conversations about sexual violence in the outside world they should be able to have them within their campus community.“There should be an inherent commitment in this school to provide [safety and protection] for you,” Burke said.  “There should be an inherent commitment to make this community less vulnerable to sexual violence and based upon the conversations I had today, there is not.”The history of Me TooGrappling with her own history of sexual violence, Burke founded the Me Too movement in 2006 as a way to give young people a platform to talk about sexual violence and a space to heal.“We were just giving language and basic organizing skills, because we believed people with the lived experiences should be at the forefront,” she said.The hashtag began in 2017 when actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, “If all the women and men who have been sexually harassed, assaulted or abused wrote ‘me too’ as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem. #metoo.”One year later, 19 million people had posted #MeToo, according to a Pew Research study.  While the hashtag increased public awareness of the movement, Burke emphasized Me Too is more than just a hashtag.  She said her work began by and continues to provide healing and advocacy for all survivors, especially for historically marginalized people.  Burke recognized that conversations about sexual violence have never occurred in the same manner they are now and encouraged the audience to “not waste this moment.”She said Me Too would not be where it is today without individuals making a decision to speak up about being “in a number no one wants to be a part of.”  Me Too going viral has brought more people into the movement to end sexual violence — higher education heavily felt its impact. Me Too at UW-Madison: In class and on campusWhile the hashtag has thrown the entertainment industry and businesses into the limelight, UW-Madison PhD candidate and business ethics lecturer Aaron Yarmel said students can gain tools to address sexual violence by studying Me Too and related topics from a variety of fields’ perspectives.“You’re making a mistake if you don’t [address Me Too in class],” he said.Other educators, like Center of Journalism Ethics Director Kathleen Bartzen Culver agreed Me Too has an important place in curricula.  “Me Too is the mother of all case studies for crisis management — it’s something that’s going to be on syllabi for years,” she said. However, Culver mentioned she aided a former student in securing an internship, who later experienced sexual assault on the job. When the student was hesitant to ask for help, Culver recognized the university has a role beyond coursework — faculty and staff need to be an accessible resource for students.“I feel that I am absolutely a resource for students who have been put in a position like that, but if students don’t feel that you are someone they can come to, if you’re just sort of reinforcing the power structure, that’s something we have to solve,” she said.Jenna Herr, a graduate student in the UW-Madison School of Business, said even after serving as co-president of Women in Business — where she would encourage any woman to feel comfortable stepping forward and being supported — she’s been in a situation where she felt support might not be available. “It’s a difficult time to navigate for sure,” she said. “I think that professors and other mentors and advisors within the school definitely have a role [in supporting students].” Culver said UW-Madison’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication aims to inform students of avenues they can follow to report sexual violence and get help from professors and advisors. The process professors follow upon receiving this information should be scrutinized to ensure situations don’t get overlooked, she added.Yarmel said he tries to provide students tools to think critically about instances of sexual harassment and encourage students to work collectively in class so they develop an ability to discuss difficult topics.  The business ethics course Yarmel teaches has a full unit on sexual harassment, as well as a space for allowing conversations on related topics to emerge naturally so students have an opportunity to discuss what is meaningful to them, he said.Herr said she likes the dialogue with her peers that occurs in class regarding current social movements like Me Too and is proud that she has never had a professor “shy away” from those conversations.The future of campus saying Me Too Burke said much of the buzz generated by #MeToo centers on the workplace, but she was clear it is about the “entire spectrum” of sexual violence, including college campuses. Higher education should “help students realize you deserve respect: this is how you can expect to be treated and if you’re not, these are the skills that you need to be able to communicate that,” Herr said.Students should be treated with dignity and respect on campus, Burke said. How students expect to be treated on campus should mirror how they expect to be treated in the real world.Student experiences with sexual violence on campus is different from the workplace because campus is an “all-encompassing environment” and the workplace often isn’t, Yarmel said. However, he emphasized that addressing both forms of sexual violence requires improving communication.“We have a general problem in our society where people don’t talk to each other, people don’t have these really difficult, deep conversations about social problems in a civil and reasonable way,” he said.Burke urged students to talk with each other to build inclusivity on campus. “There’s a group of people on this campus that has never spoken to another group of people on this campus. And I guarantee you probably have very similar experience,” she said. “Freak them out, ‘why are those two groups together?’ Get people whispering, ‘Did you see the Black Student Union and Delta Delta Delta.’’’Burke praised UW-Madison’s mission statement, which seeks to “help students to develop an understanding and appreciation for the complex cultural and physical worlds in which they live and to realize their highest potential of intellectual, physical and human development.” She said the university’s work on sexual and racial violence can help achieve this mission, but questioned its commitment to making tangible changes.  Burke parted with a message to the university: “Don’t invite me to your school and think you’re checking a box. Y’all haven’t done anything yet.” ","Me Too founder Tarana Burke, UW community demand broader conversations surrounding sexual violence",UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/03/matthew-mitnick-prioritizing-safety-on-campus,N/A,"**TRIGGER WARNING: This article contains sensitive information regarding sexual assault that may be difficult and upsetting to read for some audiences.**Two years ago, I was serially raped. I was seventeen at the time — a junior in high school. I had never experienced such terror, shame, and humiliation in my entire life; I felt as though it was my fault. Inevitably, this brutal and traumatic event reshaped how I viewed every aspect of the world.Going to a relatively small school, I timed my route to class meticulously so I would not have to run into my rapist. I was always worried I would see him in public, and sometimes I did. He would blackmail my brother and I to get what he wanted. I had nightmares, frequent panic attacks, and episodes of PTSD. Before my first semester in college, I attended a SOAR workshop that talked about sexual assault and the importance of consent before engaging in any sexual activity. As I sat through this workshop, I silently panicked. What if this happens to me again? I thought. I worried about the possibility of being raped again, but this time on campus. I worried about the possibility of my body and my mind being taken advantage of again. According to University Health Services, one in four females on this campus will experience sexual assault, and I am still not safe from that statistic. I hoped that my college experience wouldn’t be a repeat of highschool.In November, I was asked to work with Matthew Mitnick on his District 8 Alder campaign. My good friend had mentioned that one of the main policies on his platform was safety. This immediately gave me a feeling of relief. It felt refreshing to have someone running for office, especially a student like me, addressing the issue of campus safety openly. As I have worked with him through past months, we have gotten to know each other well and have become great friends. Eventually, I opened up to him about why campus safety is so important to me. I shared my story of sexual assault with Matthew and he validated my trauma, whereas some of my peers in the past did not. What had happened to me has happened to countless other individuals at UW-Madison. As students, we must work to create a safe campus so no one has to live in fear. When we talk about campus safety, it is not a matter of what gender you identify with. It is about the collective effort to strive for progressive change on campus in order to reduce assault of any kind. We cannot afford to exclude people from having a seat at the table when talking about campus safety. Rather, we should welcome all perspectives. As a survivor of sexual assault, I invite advocates like Matthew Mitnick to the table for conversations about safety on and off campus. From ideas like lighting the Lakeshore Path to a late-night free ride program for students, I truly believe that Matthew is the positive change UW-Madison students need.

Burke, a Bronx, New York native, is a social activist and community organizer who founded the Me Too Movement in 2006. Through her work in social justice, she has shared her lived experience with sexual violence for decades. The movement recently went viral and gained mass attention in the media and popularity on social media platforms in 2017. However, despite this national attention, Burke said the movement is meant to do one thing: help survivors of sexual violence with individual healing. Being a survivor of sexual violence herself, Burke said she didn’t want young people growing up thinking they were alone in something that happens so frequently but is rarely discussed. “When Me Too started, it was literally a way to give these young people language and to give them space to process and understand what sexual violence was,” Burke said.Sexual violence affects all populations, she said, but especially harms marginalized communities. She also stressed that while sexual violence expands beyond the university setting, having a safe environment on campus is something that must be prioritized. Burke said based on the conversations she had with students on campus, she does not think UW-Madison is fully committed to keeping its students safe. “There should be a commitment to make this community less inherent to sexual violence. Late alerts and pacifying emails don’t make a campus safe,” Burke said. “Do you have consistent, sustainable policies and practices in place that actively work to meet the needs of this student body?” In 2017, 318 students reported being sexually assaulted at UW-Madison. More recently, acts of sexual violence raised concern among students, causing many to protest. Burke said she hopes university officials and students alike can take accountability for their actions and move toward making the campus safer for all. She said allowing people to abuse their power and avoid accountability is something that contributes to the cycle of sexual violence.By getting involved on campus, Burke said UW-Madison students can play a role in their own safety and the safety of their peers.“Whether it’s a change in behavior, a conversation with your family, a policy check or holding your school accountable, get involved,” Burke said.  She reminded the crowd that sexual violence is real, it’s happening now and it’s an urgent issue to be taken seriously.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/03/a-conversation-with-an-early-female-cardinal-leader,N/A,"The Daily Cardinal's editorial staff over the past year was comprised of mostly women, an image uncommon for the majority of newsrooms across the country. 1944's staff looked similar — when the men left to fight in World War II, women took over. It's because of them the paper is still around today, with women at its helm. Our female news editors and management team spoke with Eileen Martinson Lavine, who served as the Cardinal's editor-in-chief during this time, the first woman to serve a full year's term. She touched on her memories of the Cardinal, and the legacy she left that sticks with us today: women can do whatever the men can do.What is the mark you think you left on the Cardinal?I was there during World War II. I was the first woman to hold the job for a full year. There were three other women who had it for three months at a time. The history book, the University of Wisconsin history, there's a volume three, and what they say then is that ""... although the Cardinal was very liberal in its views, the paper had been very much a bastion of male supremacy."" Even when I was there as a freshman in 1941... all the officers and editors were men. But then the war started, so the men left, and the women showed that women could do the job. We had a terrific newspaper, we published four days a week, we had problems with not having any advertising so the university agreed to put a daily calendar every day and pay us for it, so that helped. There were a few men, but it was a very different kind of a paper at that time — we covered world news, we had a special page in the Cardinal of the Navy. My main legacy was that we could show women could do the job as well as the men.What were some challenges you faced as a woman leader on campus during your time as editor-in-chief?The primary challenge was we had been so used to this kind of newspaper that had gone out before the war and we weren't sure how to go about it at first. We had to get cooperation from other students, we were actively working with the student government for example. In that day, it was a women's self-governance organization, everything was departmentalized. We published dating lists — before the war, sororities and fraternities would print in the Cardinal who was going to the prom with whom. Looking at it now, it's so ludicrous. We we cannot fail the future, that was a symbol we picked up. There were new buildings that were going to be needed after the war, new kinds of departments that were going to be developed. The challenge was looking ahead to the future and hoping we were going to get women in leadership positions. I finished as the editor, I was hoping my managing editor would become editor after me, but we had someone who was there my freshman year, John McNally, who was in the service and came back as a veteran with white hair! Who could compete with that? At the end of the war, women were not in top positions, but I think that over the years women did come back. Can you tell us what a typical day was like for you?I went to classes — I pride myself on never having an eight o'clock class. I was in a sorority, but I didn't spend much time there because I spent all my time at the Cardinal. They used to have 10-cent taxis then, so I would take a taxi to up to Bascom Hill for my classes. After my classes I never went home, I went to the Cardinal, and sometimes I would go back to my sorority house for dinner, then back to the Cardinal. In those days, we didn't have the technology we have today. We were in a print shop on University Avenue, and the print shop was in the back office and our office was in the front of the storefront. We had to write our articles and then give them to the ___ type guy would set them. Then we would have them set and at 11 o'clock at night we would be in back with them making up the page. I work at a magazine now and the design is all on a computer. That was one of the biggest challenges was we needed to get the paper out late at night and then in one day you had to set the type which is very different from the way you do. I had homework to do, I had papers to write, I wrote all my papers in my office. I would shut my door and do homework in between. The business manager and the editor each had separate offices. What sorority were you in?The Jewish Sorority, Alpha Epsilon Phi. Actually, my second year, when I moved into the sorority house, next door, the fraternity house, turned over to the Army, and a lot of the other fraternity houses became turned over to the army, or to military students there on campus. And the Navy was there as well, and the Air Force. Our sorority had a very big house, all the sororities up and down Langdon, were all these sorority houses. I didn’t spend much time in the house because I was always in the Cardinal. Tell us a little bit more about the Cardinal then. When I was a freshman, several of the people were men. If you look at our picture in the 1941-'42 Badger, there are a couple of women scattered around, but there are a lot of men. The next year, it was all women. There were a few men we had, but it was mostly all women. It was a great opportunity for us. In 1942, we had our first female editor, but she graduated two months later, and then we had another woman, and she graduated two months later, and then another one, who got sick, so she turned it over to me. So, I actually served longer than the regular period. I started in January of ‘44 and continued until March of ‘45. What was the Cardinal Election process like?The cardinal board, which was an elected group and we had two or three professors as advisors, elected the chief positions. I did not major in journalism. At that point, I decided I wanted to be a foreign correspondent or something so I majored in American Institutions. I decided it was a good bit of background. In those courses I was doing all the work and learning how to be a journalist on the Cardinal. Do you remember any Cardinal traditions?I can’t think of any. We were in the office every night, and we did have a final dinner at the end of the term in March. And also, the Cardinal Editors spoke to incoming freshmen when they came. All the heads of the student organizations that they might be interested in. My freshman year, our biggest source of revenue was cigarette ads, and of course once the war starts, they couldn't get cigarettes, and that’s when we lost a whole bunch of our revenue. From time to time, the department stores would run adds. We were a very liberal paper. We wrote about the war, we wrote about social issues like discrimination. I wrote a column — a lot of people wrote columns — about things both national and international and local. What stories do you remember best from your time as EIC?We didn’t do any really big research stories. There were a lot of stories about people who were elected to office and that type of thing. We didn’t do anything by way of big investigations. We had people collecting stamps for the war effort and once in a while we’d write stories about things happening in the war. So, I don't think we had anything in the way of that actually. We did not think in terms of doing some sort of intensive sort of story. We didn’t have that type of thing and we didn’t write those kinds of stories. It’s wonderful that you’re doing that. How else has journalism and the Cardinal evolved since you were editor?I thought it was very interesting the way you’ve looked into issues like housing and food. Those are issues that we didn’t look into during our day. We were mostly concerned with news about student stuff and writing about what was happening on campus. That was the main consideration. I do not think we were sensitive to those things during those days to those types of issues. During the war, it was a very different situation. The whole atmosphere was very different. A number of people accelerated and got out in three years, instead of four — and some of friends did, that I remember. It was the whole atmosphere, the whole social atmosphere had all changed by then. An article came out recently questioning people who were on scholarships and can’t afford something, I didn’t realize such a large portion of students lived off-campus. In my day, you all lived on campus or out in one of these special homes, houses that they had. Now I counted, there were far enough dorms for everybody since freshman year. We were always on campus. It was more about getting the news and sharing it with campus — there were speakers, there were government issues, but we were mostly interested in that type of thing. Concerns like sexual assault — were those prevalent on campus? No, not at all. The campus was very small, I think about 5,000 civilian students. The campus was small at the borders and that was it. Any kinds of issues like that, you never knew about. I never knew about it. When I came to school in Wisconsin, I had came from an all-girls public school. And I was only 16 years old, I had never had much contact with boys. Classes were full of them. It was no serious feat, but the Cardinal really brought me out. I really developed much more at the Cardinal. Could you describe the climate on campus?I think students just want to get through school. It wasn’t so much going into bars at night or drinking. The Rathskeller was a big center of life and the Union, all these sororities that help run social events. That was a big thing. We still had proms. The concern with most of us was get out of school, get it over. It changed so much my freshman year to my sophomore year, it was a really different in atmosphere. We spent so much time working on the Cardinal. We had to find women to work on the Cardinal and on the business staff, it was a very different kind of an attitude I think, but it was a great experience, I loved it. It’s been what, seventy years and I remember it to this day. What moments made you feel most proud of your staff?When Roosevelt died, we sponsored a forum on the radio. Of course when the war ended it was my graduation year. We had to understand the war and what it meant for us and for our future. We thought about what the university was going be like after the war. That was our big challenge at that point.Can you describe gender dynamics on campus or in the newsroom?There weren’t that many men. Our sports editor was a man, but the women really ruled the newsroom. I think we got along well together pretty much. We would train first years and they learned very quickly. We would publish four times a week. We needed to train ourselves and learn the technicalities ourselves, but we learned. And I look back on the papers now and I think we did a good job writing the stories. Of course they were somewhat narrow stories about the university and what we were doing on campus. A lot of young people wanted to write columns. I remember I once wrote a column saying how could we imagine what it was like to be fighting a war and how could we imagine what the problems were. And I got a letter back from a soldier. Those were the moments I really enjoyed.What is your advice for young journalists?You have to be hard hitting. You have to keep at it. You have to really persist. It’s pretty hard today, I think because journalism is changing as a field. You have to look for new opportunities and new ideas. I just, you know, keep at it. Do you currently have female journalism role models?In my day, I wanted to be a foreign correspondent. I’m ninety-four, and I’m still volunteering as a senior editor of Moment Magazine, centered on Jewish thought, but also I deal with politics, I deal with so much. But we have so many young people on staff, and I love watching them. They are enthusiastic and they think up these big stories and then they go and interview people. I’m so inspired by all of them and I’m so inspired by all of you. I think it’s wonderful what you’re doing. I wish you the very best now and in the future.

SBF also funds Emotional Support Animal registration for adopted pets across the country in order to support survivors.Michaels, a survivor of sexual assault, was the first person to adopt a rescue dog with the financial support of the national organization. Michaels’ own experience connected her to the mission of the organization. Michaels was assaulted when she was a freshman in college. She is a junior now, and says her dog, Mac, has helped her recover.“After I got Mac, I became responsible for another living thing,” Michaels said. “I can look forward to coming home at the end of the day, and if my roommates aren’t there I won’t be alone, which is one of the hardest parts for me.”Michaels hopes to raise enough money this semester to sponsor at least one adoption, which can cost around $500. The organization also focuses on raising awareness about mental health and sexual assault, two topics which go hand in hand. According to Michaels, the goal of SBF is rooted in a strong community support system.“I want everyone to feel comfortable in the org,” Michaels said. “I want it to be a community where everyone can bring their ideas to the table and feel completely accepted.”Michaels hopes that she can help to grow the UW-Madison SBF chapter so that it can continue after she graduates next year.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/02/medical-amnesty-associated-students-of-madison-campaigns-to-save-student-lives,"February 26, 2019 | 2:23am CST","Stemming from last semester, the Associate Students of Madison is campaigning to increase the protection of students from legal and academic sanctions in alcohol-related incidents. Their ultimate goal is to produce a statewide policy that would shield both the individual in need of medical attention and the individual seeking help from legal citations and academic punishment — whether they are on or off-campus. “With a bill like this you’re encouraging people to be safe … and to not think of whether or not you are getting your friend in trouble, but whether or not you are saving your friend's life,” said Legislative Affairs Chair Laura Downer. Currently, the Responsible Actions Guidelines at UW-Madison provides amnesty only for sexual assault victims and the caller. The exclusion of individuals in need of medical attention from amnesty discourages students from seeking help due to the possibility of getting their friends in trouble, according to Downer. The current state law provides amnesty from certain underage drinking citations and UW System Schools disciplinary actions only in the case of sexual assault.The Responsible Actions Guidelines is a campus policy, which means two things: It is only applicable to incidents taking place on campus grounds, and it is not binding for the university or law enforcement in any way. ASM hopes to extend medical amnesty to the caller and the individual in need of medical attention on a statewide level, meaning that “it wouldn’t matter if it was in the dorm, a house party, or at a bar … people shouldn’t have to question whether or not it applies depending on where in the city they are,” Downer said.  UW-Madison Administration and UWPD will keep most of the authority they possess today, meaning they may require students to take an educational course and meet with the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards. The university will also be able to exercise discretionary judgment based on situations where a student exhibits patterns of problematic behavior. ASM is striving for a medical amnesty policy very similar to current Pennsylvania State policy. The General Assembly of Pennsylvania passed a bill that provides amnesty for the caller, as long as they remain cooperative, and the individual in need at the state level. Two routes are being considered for obtaining amnesty for the students of Wisconsin: amending an already existing law or proposing an entirely new one. They are looking to amend the bill that shields sexual crime victims for being issued a citation or being subject to disciplinary measures by the UW System. The amendment offered would increase the amnesty provided by also shielding students in need of medical attention. A new bill that is solely concerned with medical amnesty has been introduced in the past, however was not passed. ASM is actively reaching out to the state legislature to strengthen the coalition supporting the bill. “We are getting a relatively positive response from the legislature, especially from people who have supported the sexual assault amnesty bill. Essentially they are saying, ‘Yes, we agree, but we have to have UW administration, the city of Madison Police, and UW-Madison Police on board,’” Downer said. “Once you have that coalition, you are well-prepared to have something passed.”",Medical Amnesty: Associated Students of Madison campaigns to save student lives,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/02/vznid63xlgwk3nh,"February 21, 2019 | 8:56pm CST","In a small, brightly lit room at one end of a long table, I sat with Alex Nelson, a UW-Madison violence prevention specialist. We discussed the fluidity of gender, the challenges that queer and transgender people face and the multitude of ways LGBTQ+ communities have been at the forefront not only of women’s movements, but social justice movements that are distinctly their own. During my conversation with Nelson, they brought up the idea that “it’s not just women,” meaning the women’s movement should never be exclusively made of people who identify as female, rather it should center on the needs of other gender minorities as well. Others — like Sylvia Johnson, an activist and musician, and Alex Little, a graduate student staff member at the Gender and Sexuality Campus Center — echoed the idea that movements championed and formed by trans people, women of color and queer people have supported and shaped modern women movements. Indeed, many people at UW-Madison and around the world do not conform to a gender or sexual binary and may face oppression due to societal backlash.For example, at UW-Madison, 69 percent of LGBQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and questioning) students felt safe or welcomed on campus, and 50 percent of transgender and non-binary students felt the same way, compared to 81 percent of cisgender students and 83 percent of heterosexual students, according to the 2016 Campus Climate Survey. Similarly, 51 percent of LGBQ and 35 percent of trans and non binary students felt like they belonged on campus, compared to 71 percent of heterosexual students and 69 percent of cisgender students. The survey was completed by 21 percent of the student population. “The campus climate survey is not particularly surprising, given the rise of the far right, the attacks on trans and gender non-conforming people,” said Johnson, an alumni of UW-Madison and an advocate for trans and queer rights. Little said they were not surprised by the results either. They also brought up wariness about an article exploring queer justice being couched within a Women’s Issue. “As important as it is to elevate marginalized voices, it’s important to analyze how we frame those discussions and break up how we’ve normally presented it,” Little cautioned. Nelson explained that it is crucial to remember and honor how queer and trans people have been at the forefront of gender and women’s movements.Queerness: A historical perspective The word “queer,” which had derogatory connotations in the past, is now used as a more inclusive, positive term. Similarly, pronouns other than “she” and “he,” such as “they,” are being used more and more by trans and non-binary people who might not feel that male or female best describes who they are. The concepts behind these words aren’t new, although Little says they have heard some people called “transtrender,” implying they identify as queer just to be cool. On the contrary, queer and trans people dot the pages of history, from Shakespeare’s gender bending sprite Ariel in The Tempest to Sappho, a greek poet who lived around 600 B.C.E. and wrote about her love for women.The prefixes “cis,” meaning someone whose gender identity matches the sex that they were assigned at birth, and “trans,” meaning someone whose gender identity is different than the sex they were assigned at birth, are actually Latin words originating around 80 B.C.E.In the United States in 1884, C.C. Converse made headlines for an invented pronoun, “thon,” which was meant to describe a third gender. And singular uses of the pronoun “they” date back to the 1300s, according to the Merriam Webster Dictionary. “It’s not quite as newfangled as it seems: we have evidence in our files of the non-binary they dating back to 1950, and it’s likely that there are earlier uses of the non-binary pronoun they out there,” explains the dictionary’s website. Merriam Webster also states that it might be confusing for some people to use non-binary pronouns, however it’s important to do so and includes resources to learn more. “This might sound intuitive, but a good rule of thumb is that when somebody tells you who they are, we believe them,” said Little. Johnson commented on how heralding back to social justice movements in the past can help people organize in the present. “I think a great point of entry is through anti racism,” Johnson said. “We need to see the radical histories that fused the struggles of black and indigenous women with black and indigenous trans women. I always tell people to educate themselves on radical history.”  Similarly, Nelson mentioned how the anti-rape and #MeToo movements were formed and sustained by black women. They also described how the queer movement was led by trans women of color, including Latinx trans woman Sylvia Rivera, who was a founder of the Gay Liberation Front and the Gay Activists Alliance.At UW-Madison, there are many organizations focusing on queer justice and inclusion, including the Gender and Sexuality Campus Center. The center was formed in 1991 by Alnisa Allgood. “There weren’t a lot resources for lesbian and gay students of color,” Allgood said. “We wanted to make sure that the campus center was not just increasing LGBT visibility, but also [supporting] ethnic minorities and other disenfranchised communities within the LGBT community.”Being Queer on campus Seeing data like the Campus Climate Survey, and seeing what changes need to be made, is helpful said Little. Despite knowing changes that need to be made, there are ways in which queer and trans students’ lives are made difficult on campus. For example, queer people are twice as likely to experience sexual assault, according to Nelson.And, though UW-Madison is unique in that it offers transition health care to students, it is sometimes a difficult process to go through, said Johnson.Johnson also described how different it was to be a cisgender man on campus than it is now to be trans on campus. “When I look back on how I was treated, it’s very different. Back then, I could just do whatever, I didn’t really think that much of how I came across. I didn’t catch a lot of stares, I didn’t catch a lot of people exhibiting hostility towards me,” Johnson said. “But, I feel a lot more powerful and able to do things now that I’m transgender. Which is not what a lot of people’s conception of what that narrative can look like.” Johnson noted that every trans and queer person has a different experience. They also brought up the ways in which the women’s movement does and should include queer and trans people. “I know a lot of cisgender women who, when they say women’s movement that includes trans women, that includes non-binary people,” Johnson said. “Lots of people have settled on the gender justice movement, which I think is great.” Johnson also stressed that if someone isn’t “woke” or well-versed in gender issues, it’s not helpful to isolate them, but rather to help them find ways to get there. There are many resources on campus to learn about gender and sexuality, to feel included, and to even become active in social justice movements. The GSCC offers a space for queer and trans people and their allies, as well as programs and workshops year round, said Little. Nelson mentioned that UHS tries hard to offer counselors who can reflect students’ identities, as well as offering GetWise workshops on sex, dating and sexual violence prevention and advocacy. These workshops include iterations that are community specific, so that students can learn in an environment where they are represented and listened to.“Listening to someone is so powerful … it’s vulnerability and connection and that will enhance any relationship,” Nelson said. Johnson stressed that community is key, and can give queer and trans students a sense of safety and belonging on campus. To queer and trans students, Little would say this: “You deserve to feel safe. There are pockets of community and they are supportive and loving and you’re deserving and worthy of feeling connected to that support.” ",Gender justice: a fluid movement,UWM

Nearly 50 years later, two women are at the helm of the paper, leading a predominantly female staff. With that, and in the wake of 2018’s Year of the Woman and the ongoing prominence of the Women’s March, there’s no better time for us to revive the issue with a modern take.To do that, we talked with some women who paved the way for current female editors. Eileen Martinson Lavine served as the Cardinal’s first year-long female editor, holding the position in 1944 to 1945. At 94 years old, she still edits a magazine. Allison Hantschel carried the Cardinal into post-grad years, where she wrote a book about the paper’s 100-year history, detailing the months during her tenure that the Cardinal ceased production. Of course, we brought Rena back to rewrite an editorial published in the 1970 issue, but with a 2019 lens. We wouldn’t be writing these words if it weren’t for these women, and the many other female Cardinalistas, that came before us. While women are triumphing — running major universities including ours, heading police departments like UW-Madison’s police, leading STEM research, thriving in athletic departments, advocating for social justice — 2019 is also a difficult time to be a woman. Lavine said when she attended UW-Madison, sexual assault didn’t happen, or at least wasn’t discussed and certainly not reported on. Now, it’s alarmingly common to hear stories of assault typically against college-aged women. Women’s rights, ranging reproductive health and pay rates, still fall short and are a highly politicized issue rather than a human one. Though the climate for women has drastically improved in the past 50 years since the original women’s issue published, there are still many hardships and circumstances that haven’t evolved with the times that we want to acknowledge. We recognize that the issues facing women spike for our LGBTQ+ peers, particularly those falling along or outside the gender spectrum. That’s why we recognize the “women’s movement” is not just for cisgender women. Gender as a concept is shifting and the fight for equal rights is fought by all historically marginalized identities. This issue — the strength and struggles we share — is for all of you. Enjoy words from women who’ve seen it all, and young women emerging in society as equal footing gets closer. Read about the strong women leading our world, and the issues persisting since 1970. Women are powerful; we’ve persisted throughout centuries.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/02/domestic-violence-survivors-can-seek-refuge-at-new-on-campus-clinic,"February 21, 2019 | 3:27pm CST","Domestic violence affects women around the world everyday, and Madison is no exception. One in four undergraduate female students reported experiencing sexual assault and 50 percent of these students were dating or intimate with their attacker, according to the 2015 AAU Sexual Assault Climate Survey. The World Health Organization also found that nearly 30 percent of women experience intimate partner violence in the Region of the Americas.The University of Wisconsin Law School aims to provide legal aid to women who experience domestic violence with the opening of the Victims of Crime Act Restraining Order Clinic this past January. Restraining orders are typically the first line of defense for domestic violence survivors seeking protection from an abusive relationship, but not all women can access or afford services to get them. The new clinic hopes to address the gap in legal aid, employing UW-Madison law students to help.Plans are underway to provide restraining order services in Dane County, as well as Jefferson, Rock and Sauk counties, according to Marsha Mansfield, a family law professor and the director of UW Law’s Economic Justice Institute. She says that UW-Madison is “partnering with domestic abuse agencies in each of these counties,” and that these agencies will refer most of their clients to VOCA.The clinic and the services it provides is funded by a grant from the Department of Justice, Ryan Poe-Gavlinski, the clinic’s new director, explained. The Victims of Crime Act of 1984 is the federal government's means of providing support for programs that serve victims of all types of crime. Each year, federal criminal fines, forfeitures and special assessments are deposited into the government Crime Victims Fund.The clinic’s primary goal is to provide direct services to people who need restraining orders — to whomever is a victim or survivor.“Our students here at the law school are able to represent the victims and survivors in court at proceedings when they are attempting to get restraining orders,” Gavlinski added. She views the opening of the clinic as an opportunity for law students to learn about trauma-informed advocacy and the dynamics of intimate violence. There are no class prerequisites for law students to serve in the program, however, they need to be able to be certified as a law student who can practice in court. The students will work directly with clients and become the main point of contact for victims.“We will help them do what they’re supposed to do for their clients, but we also want them to be able to rationalize why they think they should do something,” Gavlinski  said in reference to the participating law students. “This will give them real life experience of what practicing in court will be like under an educational setting.”Despite the prevalence of domestic abuse, there are a lot of reasons as to why victims or survivors may not report their experiences, with access to services being one of them. The addition of another resource is a huge benefit to the community of Madison, Gavlinski said. As the number of victims of domestic violence increases, the VOCA clinic embodies how universities across the country are evolving their plans of action to counteract abuse within their community.People of any gender are able to access the VOCA Clinic services by being witness advocates in a prosecutor’s office, as well as referral through counseling, safety planning and support groups. Anyone can be directly referred to the clinic after reaching out to a local agency or agency in a nearby county. Gavlinski emphasized that the direct phone number to the clinic does not require any referral and that individuals can leave a message and will receive a callback.The clinic, which is located at the Equal Justice Institute within the Law School, plans on reaching out to campus organizations to make their services more known and accessible to all. Carrie Sperling, the Law School’s associate dean for experiential learning and education innovation, said she is eager to partner with other state agencies as a means of providing a resource accessible to survivors specifically to campus. “This partnership is a great example of the university collaborating with the legislature and other state agencies for the benefit of Wisconsinites,” Sperling said. “Survivors of trauma will receive legal services they might not have been able to access or afford and our law students get a transformative educational experience that prepares them to better serve the needs of crime victims.”",Domestic violence survivors can seek refuge at new on-campus clinic,UWM

Even if we are not the majority, there is definitely a balance of women and men in ASM,” Equity & Inclusion Committee Chair Agalia Ardyasa said. “[Men] listen to us, they respect us as much as they respect themselves. In legislations and meetings, they see us as leaders.”The shift towards increasing female members of ASM has caused the organization to put more of an emphasis on women’s issues — like contraceptive services, free menstrual products and sexual assault support. “I have always known ASM to be a place where women are valued and elevated, so definitely in recent years we have focused on more women-centered issues and more and more women are starting to take leadership roles in ASM,” former ASM chair of the 24th session Katrina Morrison said. One of the major programs ASM established to help increase resources available to women was putting free menstrual products inside bathrooms around campus. In 2017, the pilot program began when products were placed in three female bathrooms around campus. Because of its success, facilities and ASM have now made free menstrual products available in around 200 bathrooms on campus, said former ASM member and PAVE Communications Coordinator Alex Hader. Select buildings, such as the Red Gym, have also placed products in the gender-neutral and male bathrooms. The next goal of the program is to have the products placed in all gender-neutral restrooms on campus, Legislative Affairs Chair Laura Downer said, in an effort to provide resources for everyone who needs them, not just binary women. “There’s a lot the university could be doing not just to support women, but also to support women who are non-binary,” Hader said. While the free menstrual product campaign was largely successful, Hader said other measures  should be taken to promote non binary women’s health,  including increasing the number of gender neutral bathrooms and ensuring that university healthcare covers trans issues. There has also been a recent push to make more lactation rooms available around campus, especially for female staff.ASM also endorsed a generic version of the Plan B emergency contraceptive pill, EContra EZ, available in both student unions for just $13.“I think that having the product be available has lessened the potential negative feelings of having to spend so much money on something that should be freely and readily available to people all the time,” former SSFC representative Sophia Alzaidi said. “Also, it is more anonymous this way in that there are so many things being sold at the markets within the unions.”Though many issues arose — funding, legal problems and pushback from administration — after nearly a semester, Alzaidi saw the program finally launch in October. “There was a lot of pushback at first from administration for myriad reasons, but in the end we all had the same goal of helping students on campus, and we ended up doing just that,” she said.The Student Services Finance Committee is integral to deciding what funds are allocated towards mandatory segregated fees are spent on, including the Rape Crisis Center and Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment. ASM doesn’t give programmatic support to the Rape Crisis Center, but it provides them with the financial means to offer their services to students and maintain the 24/7 rape crisis hotline. Though ASM does not work directly with survivors, Ardyasa hopes that they can be a liaison between student organizations and the administration to aid survivors, as well as provide more inclusive services.“We are concerned with mental health services that UHS has right now, more counselors would allow more survivors, especially women of color to get help they need,” Adryssa said.  “A lot of efforts this year are geared towards mental health, especially women of color and sexual assault survivors.”In light of the Department of Education’s recent changes to Title IX that aimed to “clarify and modify” requirements for reviewing violations of gender-based discrimination and acts of sexual violence across campuses, ASM has pushed back.Along with UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank, ASM submitted a letter expressing their concern about the changes, stating that the “changes to the Title IX rules serve only to restrict the rights of students.” “ASM submitted a comment opposing the proposed new regulations and signed on to a nation-wide campus opposition letter,” Downer said. “This will likely be an ongoing campaign which could lead to more discussion about our Title IX practices at UW.”The cited apprehension centers around the changes that would take away protections from students living off campus or studying abroad, as well as prevent campus officials from submitting official reports of sexual assault.UW-Madison, along with countless other schools around the country that left approximately 100,000 comments are currently waiting for a response from Washington about the proposed legislation.This spring, ASM representative attended the annual Association of Big Ten Students leadership conference, where further action about the Title IX legislation was discussed. For now, ASM is continuing their work with Title IX coordinator Lauren Hasselbacher to ensure that UW policies are what they should be in terms of protecting sexual violence victims, Downer said. Over the past few years, ASM has become much more involved with women’s health and safety issues, but there are still many steps to be taken, especially to ensure intersectionality in the office.“It would be really cool if ASM focused more on in the future how women’s issues differ depending on other factors such as race, gender identity, and if we took an intersectional approach to women’s issues,” Morrison said. While there is still plenty of work to be done throughout the country, ASM has become a place where women are accepted and valued — and women’s issues are being addressed more frequently not only by the organization, but throughout the university as a whole. “Moving forward, I hope that gender will no longer be an issues for someone to get involved, Ardyasa said. “I love how the culture in ASM is trying to be inclusive with everyone.”","Women of Associated Students of Madison fight for intersectional female health resources, sexual assault support on campus",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/02/nighttime-campus-safety-needs-attention,"February 21, 2019 | 12:00am CST","What time are you going to leave? Do you want to walk home together? Should we just call an Uber? Text me when you get into your car. Let me know when you get home. Call me if you don’t feel safe. Women say these things to each other all the time without a second thought. These are sayings, and associated fears, that have been passed down by generations of women. When we say these things, we also mean “walk as fast as you can,” “don’t wear headphones at night” and “don’t walk on the Lakeshore Path after sunset.” But why? In the daytime, men and women are peers; they walk with smiles on their faces as the sun shines down on the UW-Madison campus. However, at night their roles drastically change. Suddenly, women face dangers incomprehensible to most men. As soon as the dim glow of street lights and brisk nightly chills hit, women are encapsulated by an instant sense of fear. Avoid eye contact, take your hands out of your pockets, keep your head up.What it’s like to walk alone on the UW-Madison campus at night is an experience that cannot be fully understood if one has never lived it for themselves. At night, the sound of dry leaves on the sidewalk sounds a lot like footsteps approaching from behind. Is that group of guys on the other side of the street laughing at a joke, or at me? Do I need to take a longer route home in order to avoid them? This sounds like ridiculous paranoia, because it is. And while we want to believe that nothing bad could ever happen to us, there is no way of knowing if this is the time we won’t make it home safe. So we act this way every time — just in case. Despite this constant sense of anxiety, women often times insist on walking alone. We are strong, capable women during the day, and those traits don’t disappear once the sun goes down. However, this choice often leads to feelings of guilt and societal pressures begin to seep in as they dare to venture out on their own. When a woman is by herself and soon feels threatened by her surroundings, she also feels the heavy weight of not following advice from women in her life. Oh, the irony. This problem has a few simple solutions — walk home in a group or call for a ride. As women, we are so thankful to those who offer walking us home or to our cars at night. But the fact that we have to ask, like we can’t handle walking a few blocks by ourselves, not only presents us with the reality that we are not safe, but it’s also disheartening. We want to be able to roam around campus with the same worry-free attitude that our male peers have, but we cannot. Sexual assault, harassment, theft and attacks are not new to college campuses, and therefore not new to UW-Madison. Most often caused by the alcohol and party culture, cisgender women, along with transgender, nonbinary and gender nonconforming folks become vulnerable to unthinkable harms. According to the UW-Madison Annual Fire and Safety Report, over 2,200 liquor law violations occurred in 2017. In the face of 62 burglaries, 25 aggravated assaults, 25 rapes, 22 counts of stalking and 15 counts of domestic violence, how can anyone, women and marginalized communities, especially, feel safe on campus? Women on The Daily Cardinal Editorial Board even remark that being constantly exposed to local news of violence against women due to the nature of our jobs forces us to be intimately aware of such dangers. So what can we do? At first glance, nighttime safety seems like an issue that has always been there and will continue to persist. But we are still hopeful for a better future. We can continue to make campus officials and local law enforcement aware of the unique dangers women and other marginalized populations face on campus. We can participate in student government, which has a powerful voice when it comes to issues like safety, and vote in local elections to ensure that only those who take student concerns seriously are elected to office.Most importantly, we can all do the work of changing campus culture, which is an arduous but valiant task. Harmful components of college culture, like victimization, disbelief or disadvantaging stereotypes, must be unlearned.  Women’s safety on campus can no longer be trivialized nor marginalized. Campus attitudes and behaviors that actively perpetuate this culture of fear must change. Systematic changes must be put in place for thousands of women and those across the gender spectrum at UW to lessen weight of a heavy heart every night of their time here.",Nighttime campus safety needs attention,UWM

Well, for starters, women reclaimed their voices and bodies with the “Me Too” movement, which brought attention to sexual assault and sexual harassment via social media. Election time brought a wave of female candidates, and winners, in many positions in the U.S. government. As of now, women make up about 23 percent of the total U.S. House of Representatives. 2018 truly was a year full of women, but why should it be considered the only year?Women have been doing amazing things since the beginning of time. They have ruled civilizations, led armies and redefined societal norms for centuries. Cleopatra ruled over Egypt for 21 years and is considered one of the most powerful, wise and beautiful women in history, and trust me, she lived long before 2018.Joan of Arc led the French army to victory in the 15th century, an action that shocked many as war was considered a masculine task. Fast forward to relatively more recent years when courageous women led the Women’s Suffrage Movement in the U.S., leading to a societal change that was created by women, for women.All I’m saying is that women have been doing groundbreaking things since the dawn of time. Why should we expect current years to be any different? Women will continue to break barriers and change societal norms in the years to come. I urge you to stop letting one year be dedicated to women’s achievements when women have been successful since long before 2018, and make every year “The Year of the Woman.”",Why every year should be the Year of the Woman,UWM

Sexual assault, stalking, and dating violence impact our campus community and—with your input—we can work together to make UW-Madison a safer space.Sexual assault, intimate partner violence, sexual harassment, and stalking are violations of UW-Madison policy, and state and federal law. Every student has the right to be safe, and UW-Madison supports healthy, mutually-respectful relationships that are free from violence. We’re dedicated to preventing sexual violence before it happens and, when it does happen, helping address victims’ needs. When misconduct is reported, UW–Madison will act promptly to investigate, provide safety accommodations for the victim, and address concerns for a hostile environment. All reports will be taken seriously, and investigated thoroughly, promptly, and fairly. Victims of these crimes are entitled to reasonable accommodations, safety measures, and access to information, regardless of whether they choose to report. UW–Madison is committed to addressing common barriers to reporting sexual assault and ensuring the safety of its students. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual assault or dating violence, help is available at UHS.As students, your involvement in the AAU survey is invaluable and will help shape campus policies and programs.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/01/asm-blank-oppose-title-ix-changes-encourage-survivor-empowerment,"January 30, 2019 | 9:09pm CST","“I want to begin by stating unequivocally that every student has the right to be safe on campus,” UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank wrote, in an effort to reinforce expectations of protection on campus. As the deadline for comments came to a close Wednesday, Blank and the Associated Students of Madison sent their thoughts about the proposed Title IX rule changes released by the Department of Education last November. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos opened up a two-month public comment period for the new rules that aimed to “clarify and modify” requirements for reviewing violations of gender-based discrimination and acts of sexual violence across campuses. In 2015, UW-Madison participated in the first national survey that studied sexual assault and its impact on 27 campuses. It found that more than one in four undergraduate women would be sexually assaulted during their time at the university, amounting to more than 27 percent — which was consistent with national numbers. Despite these numbers, only 11 investigations were conducted. In 2017, only one student faced disciplinary action, which reflects the “already intimidating nature of the reporting process,” ASM members wrote in their letter to the department.According to the survey results, offenders were often identified as fellow students that were a friend or acquaintance of the survivor. Assaults generally occurred in on- and off-campus student housing. Many of the incidents went unreported due to a lack of confidence that there would be a fair investigation or action against the offender. “Sexual violence and misconduct is absolutely unacceptable and can have a devastating impact on students who experience it, both personally and in terms of their ability to complete their education,” Blank wrote. While Blank found some changes helpful, she noted five areas that needed to be improved in order to provide equitable protective policies and procedures to students. Her concerns focused on the role of campus disciplinary proceedings, appropriate standards of proof, off-campus conduct, informal resolutions and cross-examination processes. For each, Blank elaborated on her uneasiness in the proposal’s lack of clarity. She sought a more definitive distinction between student and administration conduct procedures, along with criminal procedures. She said she believes universities should have the flexibility to choose between the standards of “preponderance of the evidence” and “clear and convincing evidence” exclusively for Title IX cases. Nearly 80 percent of students live off-campus and more than 2,000 students study abroad each year. These students would be dismissed under the new Title XI procedures since they occur outside an institutional program or activity. However, the UW System committed to a student non-academic misconduct code that applies to sexual harassment and sexual violence that does not occur on campus. In moments when a complainant wishes to not be identified, the university said they would be granted that request. The informal resolution’s lack of fact-finding and little impact on the respondents should ensure that addressing complaints of sexual misconduct can continue without the necessity of additional items. Blank acknowledged the importance of allowing public input, stating that it “ultimately will result in better public policy.” Although ASM legislative affairs chair Laura Downer was surprised, she was happy Blank decided to share her thoughts on behalf of the university. “She hit on a lot of the similar things that the students were also concerned about,” Downer said. “I really appreciate what she did.” Last week, she and ASM chair Billy Welsh shared their lack of trust in changes that “would create additional obstacles in an already fraught process.” They also demanded student action, calling their participation and input “vital” to the campus community. The ASM members took the opportunity to craft their own letter in response, which each member signed. They documented similar concerns to Blank in their letter, stating that the “changes to the Title IX rules serve only to restrict the rights of students.”They included the fact that campus officials, like house fellows and athletic coaches, are unable to submit an official report. They also noted the use of language like “severe,” “pervasive” and “objectively offensive” could confuse victims when deciding if their experience meets the requirements for sexual harassment and sexual violence and could “dissuade [them from] reporting altogether.” Welsh said the importance of highlighting marginalized communities throughout campus that reported higher sexual assault rates than the ‘one in four’ statistic, like LGBTQ+, native and disabled students.  “ASM leaders share many of the same concerns as her, and want to create a campus environment where students feel safe and survivors feel supported,” Welsh said. “Unfortunately, this proposal does the opposite by [creating] more barriers and confusion for individuals who are in the midst of trauma.”Throughout the past two months organizations across campus — Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment, Men Against Sexual Assault and the Teaching Assistants’ Association — held events at which students could write their responses to the proposed changes. “I hope that Chancellor Blank’s letter is symbolic of future efforts to create a safe environment for our campus community,” ASM Press Director Morgan Grunow said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/01/dept-of-education-proposes-changes-to-title-ix-that-will-harm-all-students,"January 23, 2019 | 6:49pm CST","Instead of empowering survivors and holding perpetrators accountable, the proposed Title IX changes introduced by the Department of Education in November 2018 create additional obstacles in an already fraught process. In 2015, a survey conducted by the Association of American Universities found that more than 25 percent of undergraduate women had experienced some instance of sexual assault during their time at UW-Madison. Even higher rates were reported for marginalized communities including Native American and LGBTQ+ students, as well as students with disabilities. The aftermath of sexual violence for survivors is devastating, with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and even suicide among some of the common effects of this grave violation of one’s self and safety. Given that over half of incidents of sexual violence are never reported, added confusion is the last thing the Title IX reporting process needs. The Department of Education must commit to protecting students, not making them a victim of bureaucracy. The proposed set of rules is obscured in pages of lengthy legislation, but ultimately there are five amendments which would significantly hinder the ability of our university to investigate sexual assault:Requiring cross-examination of both parties at live hearings: Although UW-Madison’s current policy grants both parties questioning rights, questions are funneled through the chair of the hearing committee, providing a buffer between the complainant and the respondent. This change (§ 106.45(b)(3)(vii)) would eliminate that level of protection, requiring the complainant to answer questions from an adverse rather than a neutral party, increasing the potential of a survivor being retraumatized during the proceedings.Restricting Title IX jurisdiction to on-campus incidents: Currently, universities are responsible for investigating incidents involving students, regardless of where the incident occurs. Proposed rule § 106.45(b) (3) would limit this responsibility to on campus events or during UW-Madison educational programming, excluding students participating in study abroad programs. Only 25 percent of students at UW-Madison live in on campus, leaving 75 percent of students unprotected. Eliminating house fellows and athletic coaches as viable reporters: The proposal requires formal complaints to be filed by someone “who has authority to institute corrective measures on behalf of the recipient” (§ 106.30). This excludes house fellows and athletic coaches, individuals whom many students feel most comfortable speaking to about such serious instances of exploitation. Restricting Title IX coverage to campus property while prohibiting reports filed by the on-campus employees most likely to be made aware of incidents is not just. Narrowing the definition of sexual harassment: the definition of sexual harassment would be narrowed from “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” to “unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient’s education program or activity” (§ 106.30). Language such as “severe,” “pervasive” and “objectively offensive” could confuse victims when deciding whether or not their experience qualifies, dissuading reporting altogether. Raising the standard of evidence: Finally, the required standard of evidence in Title IX cases would be raised (§ 106.45(b)(4)(i)), and universities would be allowed to opt for less formal mediation processes, in lieu of launching investigations into reports (§ 106.45(b) (6)). This change only further discourages victims of sexual assault by reducing the minimum action universities must take.If you are concerned about these changes, an online public comment space will be open through Jan. 30. As university students who are directly impacted by this proposal, the Department of Education is legally required to respond to our concerns either through policy adjustments or justification before final regulations are enacted. A number of groups on campus are organizing around this issue and providing additional spaces for conversation and drafting of comments: PAVE will host a comment writing session on Jan. 24 from 3 to 7 p.m. in the Student Activity Center Room 3147. The TAA will host similar sessions on Jan. 21 and Jan. 24 at 5 p.m. at 520 University Ave., Suite 520; ASM’s Legislative Affairs Committee will be writing comments on Jan. 28 at 7 p.m. in the SAC Caucus Room. It is incredibly important for the safety of students of our community, and students across the country, that you make your voices heard in response to the proposed changes to Title IX.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/12/bill-barr-is-not-trumps-enemy,"December 15, 2020 | 1:52pm CST","In an interview with the Associated Press, US Attorney General Bill Barr stated that “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.” This factual statement caused a Republican revolt against Barr, with Rudy Guiliani — who Trump tapped to head his 2020 election legal team — declaring that “with all due respect to the Attorney General [a Republican, Trump appointee], there hasn’t been any semblance of an investigation into the president’s complaints.”  Jeanine Pirro, a Trump favorite Fox News host, also stated that “We need answers. We need action. We need justice. And you Mr. Barr, are so deep in the swamp, you can’t see beyond your fellow reptiles,” referring to perceived members of ‘the swamp.’ Republican outlets, elected officials and the President’s legal team moved swiftly to paint Barr as blind to widespread fraud and a ‘never-Trumper’; concurrently, Barr was further painted as a Trump enemy and heaps of praise were given to Barr, simply for disobeying the President and upholding the Constitution. But, this is the same Bill Barr that promoted a misleading and distorted account of the Mueller Report, ran interference for one the president’s 26 sexual assault cases, attempted to resolve the prosecution of Turkish state-owned bank Halkbank on behalf of President’s Trump and Erdogan (Turkey) by directly interfering in the Southern District of New York case and participated in the violent removal of peaceful protestors in front St John’s Episcopal Church so that Trump could have a photo-op with an upside down Bible. This is the Bill Barr who is now hailed as a savior of the Republic and an enemy of Trump. Newfound saviorism for Barr erases the fact that he, in his capacity as Attorney General of the United States, has continuously weaponized the DOJ to aid President Trump. He has used the office to mislead the public on the Mueller Report — a matter in which President Trump was not fully exonerated for, to try and dismiss credible rape charges against the President, and to aid in Trump’s authoritarian pandering in regards to Halkbank. Barr served as Trump’s lapdog — not the overseer of our Constitution. And finally, for once, Barr has decided to stick up for the common sense and the Constitution. But, this one act cannot erase years of damage to it. Bill Barr was not sticking up to Trump, he was simply, for once, sticking up for the Constitution and had common sense; realizing there was no evidence or data that would support these outlandish claims. Trump and his allies are currently 1-for-46 in court cases following the 2020 election — cases that alleged widespread fraud, tossing of Trump ballots and rigged election software, none of which have been proven in any of the 47 court cases thus far. Bill Barr is the top attorney in the US, his job is to uphold the Constitution; doing the bare minimum is not grounds for praise — it's in his job description. President Trump — on his favorite platform and bully pulpit, Twitter — has frequently interacted with, retweeted and endorsed tweets from notable election experts @CatTurd, @PlaysTrumpCard (with the bio “24/7 commentary supporting President Trump”) and @9NewsNancy in the last few weeks while relying on Sidney Powell, Rudy Guiliani and Jenna Ellis to spearhead his legal efforts — which have provided no concrete proof of fraud when their law licenses are on the line. Clearly there is a lack of evidence, credible sources and concrete fraud regarding the election. Yet, Trump is threatening to undermine the bedrock of our nation:  Our democracy. Georgia has certified its results twice in favor of now President-elect Joe Biden. The Republican voting system implementation manager for the state, Gabriel Sterling, told NBC that “the president’s statements are false, they’re misinformation … they’re stoking anger and fear among his supporters … this undermines democracy.” Additionally, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, countered the president’s baseless claims of election fraud on Sunday morning in an interview on “This Week” with ABC — “we’ve never found systemic fraud, not enough to overturn the election,” he said. Yet, President Trump has called on Republican Governor Brian Kemp to call a special session of the legislature to overturn the results — a strategy he has used in Arizona and Pennsylvania as well. President Trump is attempting to rewrite the results of the election, go against the will of the people and circumvent the Constitution — all treasonous, vile acts that threaten the democracy and foundation of America. Bill Barr is simply taking a common sense approach to this insane effort by the President by publicly rebuking him and standing up for the Constitution and democracy. Following his statement, Barr was summoned to the White House for a two and a half hour meeting that was described as ‘intense’ by one senior advisor. Following the meeting, Trump refused to state if he had confidence in Barr, only saying “ask me that in a number of weeks from now. They should be looking at all of this fraud. This is not civil. He thought it was civil. This is not civil. This is criminal stuff. This is very bad, criminal stuff."" As is frequent for Trump appointees, Barr resigned shortly after, citing the need to spend more time with his family over the holidays — however, it can properly be described as a rat leaving a sinking ship. Barr protected Trump for years but with the 2020 election results certified and his role as AG coming to an end in four weeks, Barr was once again looking out for himself. He released no statement on the results of the election, no statement on the certification of results, and no statement on the electoral college meetings across the country, he was too busy preparing to leave the sinking ship that is the Trump administration. We can answer one question, and that is that Barr does not deserve the respect of the American people, nor does he deserve their confidence. Bill Barr does not deserve praise nor his title as a savior for we have frequently see Barr stoop to protect the President from rape allegations, tax-related cases and aid Trump’s authoritarian allies.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/12/lawsuit-over-uws-handling-of-sexual-assault-in-pre-college-program-dismissed,"December 2, 2020 | 1:00am CST","Last year, a UW-Madison pre-college program participant filed a federal lawsuit against the university for its response to sexual assault allegations among summer program members. That lawsuit was dismissed this summer, according to court records and new reporting by the Wisconsin State Journal.U.S. District Judge William Conley found “the university’s response to the participant’s complaints failed to amount to deliberate indifference as required under Title IX.” The lawsuit revolved around an sexual assault that took place in 2018 during the school’s Precollege Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence (PEOPLE) — a pre-college program with the mission of boosting “college attainment and degree completion” for first-generation 8th-grade students or 8th-grade students from low-income families.The former PEOPLE participant and survivor of sexual assault attended the program during the summers of 2017 and 2018. The victim sued UW-Madison in the federal court, claiming employees had not handled the assault and harassment in a proper manner, according to court records. This allegation refers to multiple instances of harassment, as one female program participant allegedly pinned down and groped another female program participant. The perpetrator was asked to leave the PEOPLE program after a UWPD investigation, which led to charges of fourth-degree sexual assault from the office of the Dane County District Attorney.According to The Wisconsin State Journal, program leaders claimed to have investigated the allegations on their own, but the participant’s mother withdrew her from the program before any action occurred from the program itself. A PEOPLE program coordinator told the police that the accused perpetrator had a history of sexual harassment and inappropriate touching from the previous summer. The program involved in the lawsuit is just one of the 150 plus pre-college program opportunities offered through the university. Collectively, the programs allow up to 40,000 students — from kindergarteners to high school seniors — to come to the UW campus and expand educational opportunities and experiences.But other pre-college programs on the campus have been forced to deal with issues of misconduct in the past as well. An incidence of alleged sexual misconduct occurred on July 20, 2017, involving two individuals in the UW’s Business Emerging Leaders program. According to a police report, a female program participant (age 17) and a male mentor (age 19) engaged in consensual sex — this occurred in a university residence hall.BEL staff members required the mentor to leave building premises before calling the police after he had mentioned the 17-year-old participant was only dreaming about their interactions. According to a report, the male was not charged with any crime but he cultivated a close relationship with the victim through messaging apps. The Dane County District Attorney’s Office did not charge the mentor due to proof of consent; however, the UW-Madison Police Department (UWPD) suggested a lawsuit.Rachel Brooks, assistant BEL director at the time, was dismissed during the same summer due to staffing and budget complications. Officials said that Brooks demonstrated “poor financial responsibility” by taking mentors out on expensive meals despite having meal cards for dining halls and allowing a graduate student to drive a state vehicle without authorization.  The Wisconsin State Journal further reports that Brooks decided to start her own investigation without any police interaction on the night of the assault allegation. Staff on the night of the assault allegation called Brooks over ten times in just two hours. The program was understaffed and Brooks “ran the program by default because everyone left,” she said to the Wisconsin State Journal.   Court records show that the school struck around a $15,000 settlement — a third went to her lawyer — for Brooks’ resignation. After the settlement, her dismissal was removed from her personnel file.Parents of program members also received a letter from Russ Coff — the then Acting Dean at the Wisconsin School of Business — which vaguely outlined the incident and aimed to ensure families of “participant safety and integrity in our program.” ",Lawsuit over UW’s handling of sexual assault in pre-college program dismissed,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/11/students-show-up-to-oppose-budgeting-for-more-police-officers-downtown,"November 11, 2020 | 1:00am CST","Dozens of Madison residents, many of them students, registered to speak against an amendment to increase the Madison Police Department’s presence in the downtown area during Tuesday’s City Council meeting regarding the 2021 Capital and Operating Budget.The meeting closed without a vote on the proposal, as the Council chose to recess until Wednesday afternoon before continuing deliberation.Students on campus and off registered in numbers to speak against Amendment 10, a proposal made by Ald. Harrington-McKinney, District 1, and Ald. Henak, District 10, to accept a grant to create the “Downtown Entertainment Zone team,” which would amend the Police Department-Police Field budget. If added to the budget, the amendment would create four new police officer positions and reclassify one police officer position to a Sergeant.If the amendment passes, $347,580 would need to be appropriated for grant-related expenses. The city would also need to pay $586,600 over three years despite the grant only covering $500,000. Madison would resume paying the full cost of salaries, $390,423, starting in 2024. Many speakers pointed out that the council’s addition to the budget failed to recognize the long-term effects of the added positions to the MPD, essentially serving as a long-term investment in policing Downtown. Matthew Mitnick, the Chair of the Associated Students of Madison and member of the Madison Public Safety Review Committee, spoke on the issues associated with providing additional funding for a department that so many residents are wary of, especially when mandatory furloughs for city employees are also proposed for the budget. “Anyone who votes on this is just disregarding the entire community and insulting every person who has come out to a protest and voiced their concerns with police in this city,” Mitnick said. “This grant is an insult to all the other city departments that are having to take substantial cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic.”The Downtown team would be formed to “address violence, property crime, and quality of life issues” primarily in the State Street area. However, as Mitnick pointed out, alders from the areas that would be affected by the additional policing did not take part in drafting the proposal or even support the amendment. “This is an area that many students live in, and I don’t think students have been asked about this. I don’t think students would be in favor of this,” Mitnick said. Juliana Bennett, a UW-Madison student and Madison native, spoke in opposition of the added positions while sharing her experiences with the MPD when she came forward as a victim of sexual assault in 2018. “These safety measures we call 'policing' overlooked my problem,” she said. “I called the Madison Police to help me, and after explaining the situation and the safest manner for me to leave, the Madison Police office said, ‘We can’t help you.’”Bennet stated that the years of public education and steadily increasing MPD budget has not improved the police department’s performance in the community “Let’s not forget Tony Robinson, a Black teen in Madison that was murdered by an officer that is still employed  — Matt Kenny — for experiencing a mental health crisis,” Bennett said. “The police are too incompetent, insensitive and incapable of having jurisdiction to provide safety for the general public.”While a majority of registered speakers spoke against the amendment, some residents supported the item, claiming that a solution was needed for crime taking place on State Street. However, several of those registered speakers were listed as living outside the Downtown area. The meeting moved to recess at 11:11 p.m., after nearly five and a half hours of public testimony. City Council will reconvene Wednesday, Nov. 11 at 5:30 p.m. to continue deliberation on the Capital and Operating Budget.",Students show up to oppose budgeting for more police officers downtown,UWM

WCASA and End Abuse said they are committed to supporting policies that “reframe the concept of public safety.” Embrace is a member program of both coalitions.“We reject efforts that attempt to force us to choose between knowing that Black Lives Matter and working with legal system partners to improve responses for those survivors who engage with the legal system,” the statement read. The statement came after Barron County pulled funding from Embrace after the organization posted an anti-racism statement to their website on Sept. 30. The statement said that racism, police violence, sexual violence, and domestic violence have the same “root causes.”“We urge more community members, colleagues, and agency partners who work in all systems – judicial, law enforcement, education, health care, housing, social services – throughout our community to acknowledge the recurrent problem of racial biases, reimagine their roles, explore community-led solutions, and commit to being anti-racist through their actions and words,” Embrace’s statement read. The Barron County Sheriff’s Office, along with five other law enforcement departments, said they were ending their affiliation with Embrace after the organization’s statement, according to WPR.On Oct. 7, a week after Embrace’s statement, the Barron County Board of Supervisors executive committee voted to cut $25,000 in future funding. The board also voted to have County Health and Human Services Director Stacey Frolik resign from Embrace’s board of directors. Frolik told WPR that the funding is still in the county budget for domestic abuse services. Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald resigned from the Embrace board before their statement, partly due to Embrace’s signs in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Ftizgerald said the department will still refer victims to the organization. Embrace has provided a safe shelter, crisis support and community awareness efforts for over 30 years. Embrace is the only domestic violence and sexual assault survivor service in the rural and low-income area. Embrace’s safe shelter is in Ladysmith, Wisc., which is part of Rusk County. The organization also has offices in Barron County, Price County and Washburn County. Research suggests that the pandemic has posed heightened risks for domestic violence, including close contact between an abuser and a victim, lack of opportunity for a victim to escape and reduction in a victim’s contact with others. Other domestic abuse shelters, including Golden House in Green Bay, have seen fewer families and more single residents.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/10/bipoc-co-taa-march-for-police-free-campus,"October 12, 2020 | 9:56am CDT","Some 150 University of Wisconsin-Madison students gathered Friday afternoon to march from Camp Randall to the UW Police Department headquarters and the chancellor’s mansion to demand racial justice and a police-free campus.The group, organized by the UW-Madison BIPOC Coalition and the Teaching Assistants Association, carried signs reading, “Cops off campus” and “Can you hear us now?” as they shut down roads and intersections along their route, protected by a mobile wall of cars and bikes.Students’ anger was wide-ranging. Demonstrators spoke about their frustrations with UWPD, with racism within and beyond the classroom, with the university’s relationship with its workers and refusal to remove the statue of Abraham Lincoln from Bascom Hill. But through every topic one theme was constant: the demand to be heard and taken seriously by UW administration.“What’s taken so long?” one member of the TAA asked the crowd. “We don’t have time for this anymore. Becky is going to listen to us today.”UW administrators Christina Olstad and Mick Miyamoto were present at the beginning of the event, watching as the crowd amassed and left Camp Randall. Olstad said that in her role as Dean of Students, she regularly speaks with campus activists to ensure “success in expressing their First Amendment rights.”“I’m here to listen,” Olstad said. “They said administrators are not listening. I’m here to listen and I want to listen.”Departing from the stone archway of Camp Randall, the demonstration's first stop was the UWPD headquarters on Monroe Street, where speakers voiced their demands that the police force be dissolved and removed from campus.“UWPD has absolutely zero place in handling domestic violence, sexual assault and mental health crises,” one protester told the crowd. “Why do we have a police force, why are we paying them … all this money coming out of your tuition, when they’re supposed to protect us and they don’t?”The march is not the only criticism of UWPD made by students in recent weeks. On Sept. 29, the Associated Students of Madison, UW’s student government body, passed a vote of no confidence in the department. ASM members cited campus cops’ assistance to Madison police in summer protests where demonstrators were tear gassed as well as their resistance to calls for reform.ASM Chair Matthew Mitnick spoke about that vote at the rally. He criticized the department for redacting certain lines of its budget, which Mitnick believes are for tear gas and other crowd-control equipment.“They already had their chance, and they failed time and time again,” Mitnick said. “ASM, as you probably know, has [in the past] been an extension of the administration … This year we’re trying to change that.”The day of the no-confidence vote, UW Chancellor Rebecca Blank said she was “disappointed” by it, citing the department’s “progressive” record and saying she had never heard specific stories of misconduct by its officers, a claim that multiple protesters called “irresponsible.” From the UWPD building, the group marched to the Chancellor’s residence in the University Heights Neighborhood. Parked in the street before the century-old, red brick manor, students openly mocked it as ostentatious. The building, otherwise known as the Olin House, completed a privately-funded $2.4 million renovation in 2008.It’s unclear when Olstad and Miyamoto left the march, but they could not be seen among the crowd when it reached the Chancellor’s house.Nzinga Acosta, a representative of the Wisconsin Black Student Union, spoke about her organization’s recent interactions with the chancellor and university administration. After George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis at the end of May, Acosta said the WBSU released a statement with four demands of the UW: revisit the 13 demands of the 1969 Black Student Strike, most of which remain unfulfilled; remove the Lincoln statue from Bascom Hill; remove Chamberlain Rock, historically known as n*ggerhead rock, from campus; and for the chancellor to hold a town hall with Black students and community members and listen to their thoughts and frustrations.“When we had that conversation, everything except [Chamberlain] rock was blatantly shot down,” Acosta said.The chancellor has publicly called many of the UW BIPOC Coalition’s own list of 10 demands, including the removal of Lincoln and defunding UWPD, “nonstarters.” Blank has refused to meet with representatives of the BIPOC Coalition, instead directing them to meet with lower-level administrators. In his remarks at the Rally, Mitnick said that in a meeting, the chancellor had confused the coalition with other student orgs, falsely claiming that she had met with them.Acosta was openly frustrated with the lack of response from administrators, which she saw as a pattern dating back more than half a century to the 1969 strike.“In those 13 demands, they called for a well-rounded wellness for Black students on this campus. They called for Black students to have a place where they could feel safe. And to this day, that has not happened,” Acosta said. “We are still on the streets protesting, we are still having this conversation amongst ourselves about how this university does not care.”Before they left the chancellor’s estate, protesters duct-taped banners across the house’s front steps and leaned a cardboard tome against them with the coalition’s demands written in sharpie. As the sun set, they marched back to Camp Randall, chanting and clanging their noisemakers through the dark neighborhood as other students recorded from balconies and looked up from their picnic dinners.“The crazy thing is, my classmates down the street, they have midterms next week, and they will completely focus on that,” Acosta said. “None of this is in their scope, in their world. But we live this and breathe this every day.”","'Becky is going to listen to us today': BIPOC Coalition, TAA march for racial justice and a police-free campus",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/10/why-havent-you-watched-michaela-coels-i-may-destroy-you,"October 1, 2020 | 9:00am CDT","A cluttered bedroom, slips of paper and notes pasted hastily on a wall — it looks like a television drama where detectives work diligently to find a serial killer on the loose — but, in this case, it’s the bedroom of the young, British writer, Arabella Essideu. Just the first frame of BBC One and HBO’s “I May Destroy You” leaves the viewer with a mountain of questions.Written and created by Michaela Coel, whose most notable works include “Chewing Gum,” “I May Destroy You” is the television show of the summer. With flawless direction, writing and acting, it touches on the humanness of us all in the cultural context and stratosphere of the #MeToo movement; it is what good television is and should be in today's cultural landscape. Coel — a London-based actress, screenwriter, singer, director and producer — wrote, produced, directed and starred in this 12-part comedy-drama series. Drawing off her own experience of sexual assault, Coel weaves Arabella’s trauamatic, gut-wrencing story together while maintaing top-notch humor, though often rooted in the tension and darkness of the situation at hand.The tension, flowing freely through all of the dialogue, keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. The dialogue, infused with English and London slang, is fast; the intimacy between Arabella and her friends is obvious through every word, every ting, every innit. This Black Britishness, an integral component of the story and the characters, as described by Bolu Babalola, at Vulture, “is not notable, and to understand that it is not notable, you must first recognise that it is present and important. You must recognise that it matters. Black Britishness need not be removed to relate to the show. 'I May Destroy You' as a piece of art, is not in the business of servicing those who ignore the needful. It is an intellectually and emotionally vigorous show that gloriously presents its world without explanation. It is a show that states that when one says rah, you don’t need to understand to understand.”Contemporary television, so often confined and constrained to Whiteness and Americanness, deserves more put forth by creatives like Coel, who draw on their background and their distinct personal experiences, yet connect the story to the humanness of us all.Coel was offered $1 million to develop the show with Netflix. But after learning she would not receive rights or any percentage of the copyright of her experience, her idea, her show — she turned down the offer. In a stunning profile, at Vulture, E. Alex Jung describes the brilliance of Coel and her show. “There is no writers’ room; she is her own fuel and engine. As she imagines her onscreen character, Arabella, she considers her own life and the lives of others.”It’s Coel’s story, but a masterful fictionalization, bursting with complex storylines and characters experiencing everything that makes humans human. It’s practically impossible to describe what the show is actually about without doing a disservice the brilliance of Coel and her writing. We see the protagonist Arabella and her best friends Terry (Weruche Opia), an aspiring actress, and Kwame (Paapa Esssideu), a fitness instructor, deal with topics ranging from consent to relationships to sexuality to ambition and success. Themes, like that of consent, for instance, are often turned on their head, and observed through a kaleidoscope; the viewer is left to interpret all perspectives, all experiences and all emotions. The show is messy; messy in the sense that the viewer faces a moral dilemma, requiring serious introspection. Arabella isn’t perfect; she reads situations wrong, she is a bad friend at times, she causes the viewer to shake their head and want to scream at the screen. This is the genius of Coel: as a writer, a director and an actress. The audience is left rooting for Arabella, hoping that she finds happiness and closure after a horrific, traumatic assault; but there are moments where you don’t like the character. This is the complexity of humans and the human experience, presented beautifully through the life and decisions of Arabella.Dancing around the intricate dialogue and the phenomenal writing and acting, is the music. Without a set soundtrack, music used throughout the series ranges from British hip-hop to Gospel to Garage to EDM to Indie Pop. Every song, carefully selected to reflect the conversations, the moments of silence, the inner-thoughts of characters, is powerful in its words, its sounds and meanings.Arabella dancing, Arabella stumbling, Arabella reaching for the door to leave Ego Death Bar — Reverend Milton Brunson & The Thompson Community Singers’ “It’s Gonna Rain (Come On in the House)” plays. ""Can’t you see the clouds gathering?/Don’t let it be, said too late/There’s a brand new feeling in the air/Better run, in the ark, before the rain starts."" What happened? Is Arabella okay?The music stops abruptly. Arabella typing vigorously, showering, using the restroom, brushing her teeth — a sensory overload; it’s hard to listen.Arabella walking the streets of London, disoriented, the buses, the cars, ringing — blood dripping from her forehead.What happened? Is Arabella okay? Now in the comfort of her flat, she grabs the door knob to enter her bedroom; a violent image blankets her mind. What happened? Is Arabella okay?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/10/1964-uw-madison-graduates-roommate-dropped-out-after-backdoor-abortion,"October 11, 2020 | 7:17pm CDT","Decades after a University of Wisconsin-Madison alumna found her freshman-year roommate bleeding in their dorm room, the campus remains a battleground for women’s rights.“In those days, there was no ‘pro-choice,’” the source said. “Women were considered to be unable to make decisions about themselves.” According to the source, this way of thinking was highlighted by a strict curfew for female students in the UW-Madison dorms, while “the boys could do whatever they wanted.” Male staff and students never referred to women on campus as women; they were “girls.”The source returned to her dorm room one night in fall 1960 to find her roommate in bed at an uncharacteristically early hour. Her roommate brushed the source’s concern aside and said she simply felt under the weather. The source left for dinner and returned one hour later.“I came back and she was hysterical because she was bleeding terribly,” said the source. Back then, students couldn’t make calls from their dorm buildings, so the source ran downstairs to alert the dorm advisor.“I said to her, ‘[my roommate] needs to get to the hospital. She’s bleeding and you’ve got to call the ambulance right now,’” the source said. According to the source, the advisor claimed she needed more information to call Emergency Medical Services.“I looked at her, and I was all of 17 years old,” the source recalled. “I said, ‘Either you’re going to call them, or I’m going to call them.’”“They saved her life,” the source said of the first responders who arrived after the advisor eventually called the paramedics. The source went to the hospital with her roommate, where she learned about the backdoor abortion her friend had earlier that day. “She was alright, but she was never able to have children,” the source said of her roommate.The Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, almost a decade later. Forty-five years after the decision, however, reproductive healthcare faced a new threat: President Donald Trump’s appointment of conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. Kavanaugh’s 2018 confirmation raised concerns among women’s rights activists in Wisconsin about the possibility of a right-leaning Supreme Court revisiting Roe v. Wade. A 170-year-old state abortion ban would go into effect automatically if the decision were overturned; abortion would become illegal in Wisconsin again.Nine states passed legislation restricting abortion procedures by June 2019. Some of the newly introduced laws did not offer exceptions for cases of rape or incest and many were promptly blocked by federal judges. Though the source no longer lives in Wisconsin, she worried the state may be the next domino to fall in enacting laws to limit abortion access.“I always thought if this country survived 1968, they could survive anything,” the source said, referring to the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and former President Robert F. Kennedy. “Now, I’m not so sure.”Kavanuagh’s confirmation was temporarily delayed by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony before Congress that the Supreme Court nominee had sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school. Though Kavanaugh was confirmed despite her allegations, Ford’s testimony inspired other survivors to share their stories. Nathalie Reinstein, who was a freshman in college at the time, came forward in 2018 via Facebook about surviving an assault at a UW-Madison fraternity party during her junior year of high school.“I blamed myself for willingly drinking his drinks. I blamed myself for willingly kissing him on the dance floor. I blamed myself for willingly flirting back,” Reinstein said on Facebook. “So I stayed silent.” It took her three years to publicize her story, Reinstein said in an interview, because she feared social repercussions for coming forward.“We fear that we will be dismissed as liars, as overly-emotional women, and as non-credible sources accused of having an agenda,” Reinstein said on Facebook of herself and other survivors. “If Brett Kavanaugh is given a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court, then women and other survivors in this country will be sent a painful message: our stories don’t matter.”A 2019 campus climate survey reported that 26 percent of UW-Madison undergraduate women had experienced sexual assault since arriving on campus. Nola Pastor, a violence prevention specialist for University Health Services at UW-Madison, explained that people often assume survivors could have prevented their attackers from assaulting them.“Our society often tends to ask survivors questions like, ‘Why don’t you fully remember what happened? Why didn’t you fight back?’ A lot of things that are really blaming and can be re-victimizing for survivors,” Pastor said.Ford’s testimony sparked protests across the country, including in Madison, the Wisconsin state capital. Thousands gathered to march from the bottom of State Street, through Langdon Street, which houses the Greek Life buildings, and up to the capitol building, where survivors were invited to share their stories.“After watching [the hearings] I was like, ‘There’s no way he could get appointed and confirmed',” said UW-Madison senior Mia Wagner. “Now I think I am kind of expecting everything to go for the worst.”Wagner said she felt compelled to attend the Madison protest against Kavanaugh’s appointment not only to show support for survivors, but for her own mental health. It put her at ease as a reproductive justice activist to witness other people expressing frustration over Trump’s appointment of an alleged sexual assailant to the Supreme Court.Women’s rights activists in Wisconsin have also expressed concerns about exclusivity in advocacy groups, especially amongst white feminists. UW-Madison is a predominantly white campus whose student leadership has been scrutinized for ostracizing students of color. The university’s homecoming committee posted a video on Facebook in October titled “Home is where WI Are,” but it was deleted following prompt criticism from students and alumni who pointed out that almost all of the featured students where white and the “underrepresented populations” the video’s narrator referenced were left out.Black women experience sexual assault at higher rates, but are less likely to report it, according to Now.org. A report by the National Women’s Law Center found that four in 10 Black women cannot afford to pay more than $10 for contraception. Consequently, Black people who menstruate are likely to be disproportionately affected by the Supreme Court’s ruling this month upholding the Trump Administration’s 2017 rollback on the Obama-era contraceptive mandate; this ruling allows employers to refuse to provide birth control coverage for their employees.“It’s important to highlight the statistical differences between the sexual assault victims of color, specifically women of color,” Wagner said. “That is something that has been kind of left out of the conversation, at least in the circles that I’m in. But that’s where I think there’s an opportunity for the university to address that differently.”Wagner, who founded the UW-Madison Reproductive Justice Coalition Board and formerly held a board position for the Student Alliance for Reproductive Justice board member, discussed the abundance of events about reproductive rights students can attend. Her organizations coordinate Condom Crawls with high student turnout, informative panels and promotional events to discuss access to reproductive health care — a stark contrast from the campus the source knew in 1960. “Obviously 2016 was a big step back [for women’s rights],” Wagner said. “I’ve been really encouraged and uplifted by the readiness people have to jump into action.”In addition to her campus involvement, Wagner interned at Planned Parenthood for two years, earning praise from women’s rights activists. The source’s mother unconventionally volunteered at Planned Parenthood in the 1950s, but despite her favorability toward access to reproductive healthcare, the source didn’t share with her what happened to her freshman year roommate. “Pro-choice” didn’t exist back then, according to the source. Her roommate’s father, a well-known surgeon, remained unaware of his daughter’s situation until her trip to the hospital. Despite legal changes and new campus clubs to promote women’s rights issues, there remains a lack of dialogue to address the issues of sexual violence on college campuses and limited access to reproductive health care.“It took me years to finally come forward with my story,” Reinstein said. “Initially, I was just terrified.” Her Facebook post came three years after the assault.“People just don’t have the training and preparedness to be able to comfort someone” who has been assaulted, Reinstein said. Pastor and other violence prevention specialists at the Violence Prevention and Survivor Services division of UHS have plans to change that. They have implemented required workshops for incoming UW-Madison students to learn about consent and empathizing with survivors and are working on ways to improve their current programs, like having more student leaders co-facilitate workshops.“Education coming from someone that’s a part of your community is really powerful,” Pastor said. Though Pastor acknowledged the difficulty of changing cultural norms, she expressed optimism about tackling campus sexual assault.“We’re up against a whole history of sexual violence often being normalized,” Pastor said. “It takes a lot of time and energy to change those numbers … It’s on all of us to work really hard to get there.”",1964 UW-Madison graduate's roommate dropped out after backdoor abortion,UWM

The two, along with similar-minded individuals, created a Facebook page to plan a demonstration at the Wisconsin State Capitol this Friday in opposition to Gov. Evers’ decision to extend Wisconsin’s “Safer at Home” order until late May.Interest for the April 24 “Freedom Rally” quickly grew as more than 3,330 Facebook users said they would attend the protest and almost 13,000 other users indicated they would consider going. “The Governor was not returning emails, his voicemail was constantly full and he was not addressing our concerns,” Elmer said. “We felt abandon[ed] and had to do something.”Following a weekend demonstration in Brookfield, a new wave of protests set to take place against the state government underscores the contentious battle between carrying out public safety practices and sacrificing personal freedoms amid a global pandemic. The central component to the protesters’ grievances is the economic hardships resulting from the closure of non-essential businesses and a perceived violation by the government in restricting ordinary citizens from carrying out their daily routines.The protesters do not necessarily disagree with social distancing rules, rather they want the state to re-open and for individuals to take personal responsibility in administering the guidelines on their own accord, said Tony Szak, an organizer for the Open Wisconsin Now March, which will take place alongside the Freedom Rally.“I thought [the extension] was an overreach of power. It really pushes back on our civil liberties as working Americans,” Szak said. “We’re looking to show the state of Wisconsin and the elected officials that there are people out there willing to go back to work.”Szak, who works for a manufacturer in the construction industry, along with his wife, a nurse with Gundersen Health Systems in the La Crosse area, are considered essential workers. However, fellow community members have been furloughed, taken pay cuts and lost their jobs.  “Even if you are an essential business, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re getting the same number of clients or customers or patients that you are seeing before,” Elmer-Melby said. “These small family businesses just may not be able to reopen.”Elmer-Melby’s husband, who manages a chiropractic clinic, qualifies as an essential worker. But with a mounting grocery bill and keeping five kids at home, she pointed out an overlooked consequence of social distancing — mental health. A survivor of sexual assault and abuse as a child, Elmer-Melby suffers from complex PTSD, anxiety and panic attacks. Being confined to her house has triggered “emotional flashbacks,” fostering a difficult living environment. With more time at home, Elmer also has had more time to consider what should be done from the Governor’s office. “Our ultimate goals with hosting this rally are to bring awareness to the other side of this heavily divided topic … and encourage our Governor and the Department of Health to start working with real people and come up with a plan that works for everyone,” Elmer said. “He needs everyone’s input on this, not just the people in [his] office.”With the protests slated for 1 p.m. Friday, both demonstrations will commence without any permit from the City of Madison to assemble. Elmer said guest speakers — including farmers, religious leaders, medical professionals and business owners — will also offer their insights about the COVID-19 outbreak. Despite guidelines prohibiting social gatherings of more than 10 people to prevent the transmission of the novel coronavirus, Szak and Elmer-Melby acknowledged the dangers associated with congregating a large number of people and anticipated participants would wear protective equipment and exercise some social distancing measures at the rally. “Obviously, there’s a risk to any kind of gathering. There’s a risk for getting COVID-19 by simply going to your local grocery store or your local hardware store or any of those businesses that are open,” Szak said. “We understand the risks, but we also understand that we have a right to assemble and we have a right to show our leaders in government that we can be responsible, and we should be able to have the right to go back to work.”But in a state with 4,845 confirmed cases of the virus and 246 reported deaths, including seven new cases in Milwaukee potentially linked to the April 7 primary, city and county officials voiced their disapproval in holding the demonstrations.“Protesting Gov. Evers’ ‘Safer at Home’ order is selfish and a blatant disregard of others' safety, and disrespectful to those who are on the frontlines of the pandemic,” Dane County Board Supervisor Elena Haasl, District 5 said. “We are all in this together to flatten the curve in Wisconsin, and the only way we can do this is if we limit contact with others. Evers has made this difficult decision because it will save lives and protect the citizens of our state and I fully stand behind his decision.”Public health officials also advocated for the ‘Safer at Home’ guidelines. A model created by Wisconsin’s Department of Health Services originally projected around 22,000 positive cases of the novel coronavirus and between 440 and 1500 deaths by April 8. With social distancing, however, the numbers remain significantly lower.“Limiting physical contact between people is our only tool at slowing the spread of this virus,” DHS Secretary-Designee Andrea Palm said. “We will continue to work through our statewide response to develop capacity to implement effective containment strategies across the state. These are critical steps to prevent a future surge of cases.”While Szak believes the “Safer at Home” order has worked in containing the spread of the virus, he believes COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated and healthy individuals should be able to return to work, even with the prospect of a surge of new cases. He advocated for individuals to take personal responsibility in wearing protective gear and for individuals to monitor their health if the state were to re-open. “When we start going back to work, we’re going to see a spike in infections,” Szak said. “But flattening the curve means that we were getting our hospitals equipped and everyone ready for what can happen in the future.” As growing pessimism toward social distancing and shelter-in-place policies continues to spread across Wisconsin and the United States — with three conservative pro-gun activists creating seperate Facebook groups in support of anti-quarantine protests and Republican lawmakers asking the state Supreme Court to block Evers' extension — public health has entered the political arena as a victim of public opinion.  “We’ve polarized this country so much that even when it’s life and death, evidence-based policymaking is only an afterthought,” said Madison Ald. Max Prestigiacomo, District 8. “These protests are simply a symptom of a more significant issue that we’ve allowed to fester: the politicizing of science.” Evers’ new mandate to extend “Safer at Home” will be implemented on Friday. Non-essential businesses will be allowed to open and conduct “minimum basic operations” including curb-side pick-ups and deliveries. Recognizing the difficult situation, Evers’ message stayed consistent with all other proponents of social distancing: a collective effort will be needed to effectively combat the virus. “Wisconsinites, I am once again calling on you to rise to the challenge. ‘Safer at Home’ is working,” Evers said. “We have reduced cases, prevented hospitalizations, and saved lives. So let’s get this done together.”","‘We have a right to assemble’: Protests against ‘Safer at Home’ order highlights growing conflict between public health, personal freedoms",UWM

Medical amnesty policies aim to shield individuals from penalization for seeking medical help while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Currently 10 Big Ten institutions have medical amnesty policies. In the past the UW-Madison’s Responsible Actions Guidelines provided amnesty only for sexual assault victims/survivors and the caller. The exclusion of individuals in need of medical attention from amnesty discourages students from seeking help due to the possibility of getting their friends or themselves in trouble, according to ASM Chair Laura Downer.The Amnesty Through Responsible Action program aims to extend the guidelines set forth by the university to offer sanctions for students in need of medical attention, as well as their companions. “High-risk behaviors such as binge drinking and abuse of alcohol and other drugs ... is an environmental reality within UW-Madison,” the legislation said. “Fear of retribution, peer pressure, and impaired judgement under the influence of alcohol and other drugs create a perceived barrier to choosing to help a student in need.”The amnesty program advocated for by ASM aims to create a safer environment for students by offering amnesty for both the student in need of medical attention and the caller. In order for the students to receive amnesty they must fully cooperate with university personnel. “Out of a lot of the things that ASM does this one is probably one of the most dramatic ways in which we are helping our students.” ASM Rep. Yogev Ben-Yitschak said. The Amnesty Through Responsible Action program passed unanimously by ASM calls the university to implement the program at the beginning of summer 2020. ASM envisions the program becoming a state level law protecting students seeking help in times of need. “In the coming weeks and months we will be working very closely with the city of Madison and state of Wisconsin to elevate it to a city-wide, statewide, UW System wide policy.” Downer said.

The Victim-Offender Dialogue program is an opportunity for victims, survivors and their relatives to meet with the individuals who have committed crimes against them. This process is completely confidential and voluntary on both sides. Crimes could include: homicide, sexual assault, incest, child abuse, domestic violence, kinapping/false imprisonment, robbery, armed robbery and burglary, among others. Jonathan Scherrer, the director of the Restorative Justice Project, is a clinical assistant professor in the Law School with a seat on the Advisory Council for the National Association of Community and Restorative Justice.By facilitating a dialogue between a victim and their offender, the victim is able to have their questions answered, leading to reduced trauma in the aftermath of the crime. “By providing them a means of engaging with one another in a very positive way, we’ve seen really incredible outcomes,” Scherrer said. The dialogue works to humanize both sides in order to come to an understanding, according to Scherrer, who recalled when a victim advocated for the release of their offenders after their discussion. Alongside their dialogue program, the Restorative Justice Project also focuses on teaching students restorative practices in local communities. They provide opportunities for students to address conflict and harm in their own neighborhoods and schools in a coalition with the Dane County Community Restorative Court.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/02/badger-players-gear-up-for-the-nfl-draft-a-look-at-where-top-players-might-land,"February 13, 2020 | 1:24pm CST","As per usual, Wisconsin’s football organization is budding with NFL caliber talent, and with the Super Bowl comeback of Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs now a distant memory, the NFL Draft is on everyone’s mind. Hoping to replicate the NFL success of past Badgers such as Russel Wilson or JJ Watt, many of Wiscosin’s best players will soon become professionals. Let’s take a look at where these Wisconsin Badgers may land in the NFL draft.  Jonathan Taylor, Running BackOver the past three seasons, Jonathan Taylor has acted as the offensive pillar the Badgers. The star running back has broken several impressive records while at Wisconsin, including the FBS record for most rushing yards through his junior year with 6,174, and the most 200-yard rushing games with 12. In addition to these impressive feats, JT finished as the number six all time rusher in NCAA history, also finishing within the top ten in Heisman contention in all three of his college seasons. However, with these accomplishments also come areas of concern. Through his three years at Wisconsin Taylor has had a problem holding on to the ball. When compared with the other top running backs entering the 2020 draft — such as Ohio State’s J.K Dobbins or Georgia’s D’Andre Swift — JT has more than double the fumbles committed over the last three years. Because Taylor is seen as being careless with the football, he isn’t the top running back of his class. That being said, JT is still very likely to be picked during one of the earlier rounds. Some landing spots for Taylor include the Indianapolis Colts, Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens. The transition for Taylor to the Colts would be perhaps the most seamless, as both the Badgers and Colts are known for their strong offensive lines. Wisconsin’s offensive line this year was considered one of the best run blocking O-lines in the nation, with stars like Tyler Biadasz and Tyler Beach. As for the Colts, their O-line was ranked third best in the NFL this past season, with Quenton Nelson leading the charge as the number one run-blocking offensive guard over the past two years. Taylor would likely be available when the Colts pick at 34 or 44 in the 2nd round, and act as a good fit alongside Jacoby Brisset behind that powerful line. Prediction: Indianapolis Colts, pick 44 Zack Baun, LinebackerBaun was a dominant part of Wisconsin’s ruthless defense this year, but his success didn’t come easy. A broken foot injury in 2017 cost Baun his entire season and a ton of draft stock. However, that changed after his remarkable Senior year at Wisconsin. In 12 games playing for the Badgers, Baun recorded 53 solo tackles, a team leading 12.5 sacks from the edge, and one pick six. These stats should warrant a very early spot in the draft, but due to a stacked defensive class — think Ohio State’s Chase Young and linebackers Isaiah Simmons from Clemson and Oklahoma’s Kenneth Murray — Baun will likely fall to the late 2nd or 3rd round. A team that may be interested in snagging Baun, the Carolina Panthers. This offseason the Panthers lost one of the best linebackers in the league in Luke Kuechly, who decided to retire after eight strong seasons with the team. Looking to replace Kuechly, the Panthers may select Baun due to his similar features and playing style. Kuechly was 6’3’’ 238 lbs, and Baun is entering the draft at 6’3’’ 235 lbs, almost identical measurements. Kuechly was a dominant off-ball linebacker, a play style Baun will likely transition to when he joins the NFL. Although Baun impressed scouts with his ability to blitz off the edge, he truly excelled when dropping back in pass coverage. This skill was demonstrated by Baun’s two interceptions this season, where he showed great zone coverage instincts and impressive hand-eye coordination. Prediction: Carolina Panthers, pick 69Tyler Biadasz, Offensive Linemen Junior Tyler Biadasz will enter the draft as arguably the best center in this year's class. Among his many accomplishments, Biadasz was a unanimous All-American selection in 2019 and honored with the Rimington award for most outstanding center, something never before given to a Wisconsin offensive linemen. His run blocking was also one of the main reasons for running back Jonathan Taylor’s historic three seasons with the Badgers. Due to his impressive play, Biadasz will likely warrant an early to middle 2nd round draft pick. Some probable suitors for Biadasz include the New York Jets and Los Angeles Rams. The New York Jets offensive line was truly horrendous in 2019. Big free agency signings such as center Ryan Kalil and tackle Kelechi Osemele completely backfired for the Jets, as neither player was able to finish the season with the team. In addition, due to an injury bug that plagued the Jets, there were nine different o-line player combinations thrown out on the field throughout the season, thus preventing any consistency. It resulted in newly signed running back Le'veon Bell having his worst statistical season ever, and the Jets finishing dead last in total offense. If they choose to draft Biadasz with the 48th pick, the Jets will greatly upgrade their dismal o-line and finally replace longtime Jet, and future hall of fame center Nick Mangold.Prediction: New York Jets, pick 48 Quintez Cephus, Wide Receiver Cephus was a large part of the Badgers offense in 2019, but just like Baun, he too had a rough start to his college career. Cephus’ first substantial playing time came in 2017, in which he caught 30 passes for 501 yards and six touchdowns before a broken leg terminated his season. To make matters worse, in 2018 Cephus was removed from the football team amid allegations of a sexual assault that took place in April that year. Cephus was later acquitted during his trial and was reinstated to Wisconsin to carry out his junior year. Cephus put these issues behind him and didn’t disappoint in 2019, catching 59 passes for 901 yards and seven touchdowns. Due to this impressive play, Cephus decided to forgo his senior year at the university and enter the NFL draft. However, as a result of his inconsistent playing time leading up to his dominant Junior year, Cephus is likely to fall to one of the mid/late rounds. A possible landing spot for Cephus is the New England Patriots, who will likely be looking to fill their desolate wide receiver position this upcoming draft. The Patriots passing offense struggled last season due to the departure of star tight end Rob Gronkowski, and inconsistent play of wide receivers Mohamad Sanu and N'keal Harry. The Pat’s have proven time and again their ability to find diamonds in the rough during later picks of the draft, and Cephus may just as well be the next one they find. Prediction: New England Patriots, pick 125Other notable departing BadgersSome other notable Wisconsin draft prospects include linebacker Chris Orr and tackle David Moorman. Orr had a very impressive 2019 season after finally being given the starting role in his senior year. In 14 games with the Badgers, Orr erupted for 11.5 sacks, 78 total tackles and two forced fumbles. However, Orr’s struggles with covering large zones, and his small build in relation to NFL inside linebackers are the main reasons why he will likely go undrafted. Another Badger who will likely not hear his name called in the draft is Offensive Tackle David Moorman. Moorman was a true team player for Wisconsin, as he frequently changed positions on the offensive line and even played tight end when needed. However, his skills are most likely not good enough to transfer to the NFL.",Badger players gear up for the NFL Draft: A look at where top players might land,UWM

The final decision to bring the jets to Truax Field, a military facility located at Dane County Regional Airport six miles northeast of downtown Madison, will be made by the Air Force 30 days after the study.The forum, sponsored by Safe Skies Clean Water Wisconsin, including Ald. Rebecca Kemble, District 18, Maria Powell of the Midwest Environmental Justice Organization and Brian Benford, the former president of the City of Madison Equal Opportunities Commission. Panelists focused on the increase of chemicals commonly known as PFAS due to the inevitable pollution of the F-35s, which are classified as nuclear weapons delivery systems. “There are all kinds of health problems associated with [PFAS]. Cancer, thyroid problems, all kinds of things,” said Tom Boswell, the community organizer of Safe Skies Clean Water Wisconsin. “It’s in our water. Starkweather Creek is probably one of the most contaminated places in the state.”It was also noted by panelists that the effects of the noise and military-grade pollution will disproportionately affect neighborhoods closest to Truax Field, mainly populated by low-income residents and people of color. “We know F-35s are bad. How do we know that? A lot of our information is from the Air Force’s own information,” Ald. Kemble stated. “We learned in August when they released the draft of the first EIS how bad these are for humans to be around.” Kemble pointed out that the jobs created by the aircraft base will be sourced out or given to contractors instead of going to locals. She added that while the Air Force promises to mitigate noise, in actuality they have no resources to accomplish this, as shown in the draft of the EIS.“There’s a myth that the International Guard is a good neighbor,” Kemble said. “Well, tell that to people who have been sexually harassed and assaulted. The guard is now under federal investigation for that.”Max Prestigiacomo, UW-Madison student and next District 8 Alder, was shocked by the potential effects of an F-35 base in Madison. “Sitting in the audience at the F-35 forum struck me with immense fear for our community,” Prestigiacomo stated. “I’m fearful for our water that’s currently being tainted with PFAS and on course to increase if F-35s are placed in Madison. I’m fearful that our country will not stop wasting billions and trillions of taxpayer dollars on war machines that perpetuate the climate crisis.” Nada Elmikashfi, another UW-Madison student that attended the forum, expressed concern for the vulnerable populations on the East Side that would be most affected by an F-35 base. “Wisconsin has a long way to go when it comes to healing the racial disparities that divide our communities,” she said. “However, immoral capitalist-racism has never been more unapologetic than it is with this proposal. This is not what we stand for in Madison.”  If Truax Field is chosen by the Air Force after the release of the EIS, the F-35 jets would arrive in 2024.",Opposition‌ ‌of‌ ‌F-35‌ ‌fighter‌ ‌jets‌ ‌in‌ ‌Madison‌ ‌leads‌ ‌public‌ ‌forum‌,UWM

Her nine-month projected salary of $118,308 was 50 percent higher than the department’s chairwoman, according to the Gazette. Instead, Kopper spent much of the fall semester on the Wisconsin Family and Medical Leave Act, which employees can use “when you need time off from work to care for yourself or a family member who is seriously ill, to care for a newborn or newly adopted child, or to attend to the affairs of a family member who is called to active duty in the military.”Following an open records request filed by the Gazette with UW-Whitewater five months ago, Alexandra Stokes, the public records custodian at UW-Whitewater, sent the records on Tuesday — after a reporter followed up on the story Monday.Stokes said Kopper’s leave was redacted because she sought to protect “the confidentiality and privacy of personal medical information.”Kopper’s leave occurred from Sept. 1 to Nov. 24. Frank Koza, the dean of the College of Letters and Science, wrote to UW System Legal Counsel Tomas Stafford the university would assign a “project for her to work on the last four weeks of the semester,” according to the records.Stafford noted, however, Kopper could extend her leave. Yet it remains unknown how Kopper spent the rest of the semester, according to the Gazette. The records investigation comes amid a university effort to restructure around $12 million in budget cuts related to declining enrollment and subsequent revenue loss.“Over the past year or more, UW-[Whitewater] has suffered from news stories that might have negatively affected our reputation,” current Chancellor Dwight Watson said in a budget listening session.",Records show former UW-Whitewater Chancellor spent semester on paid medical leave,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/02/even-as-we-grieve-we-need-kobe-accountable,"February 6, 2020 | 7:00am CST","Amidst the whirlwind of the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant, Gianna Bryant and seven others, a new piece of Bryant’s legacy has emerged: a case of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman. Bryant believed the exchange was consensual. The victim did not. The question of consent still hangs in that Edwards, Colorado hotel room. Though this news has just resurfaced, I feel I already know what topics of discussion this might yield. Perhaps it will raise questions about what is consent. Maybe it will call into question racial dynamics in cases of sexual assault. I’m sure there will be those who don’t want this circumstance to tarnish Bryant’s sterling legacy, while others will. We get so trapped in the verbiage around consent, assault and rape, as if defining these terms will make sure those guilty are punished and those innocent are redeemed. No amount of speculation will destroy the patriarchy and misogyny this nation thrives on. And, no precision of language will ensure that perpetrators are served justice. After I read this story, I imagined all the debates that would be made if the American people cared enough about sexual assault to give it its due time in our public discourse and courts of law. But I know what will not happen. This story will disappear. And it will be but a mere speck of imperfection on Bryant’s golden image. Was Bryant an icon? Of course. Was he a legendary athlete? No doubt. But in 2003 he committed an unforgivable offense. Whether consent was given or not is irrelevant. An incredibly prominent American hero asked a teenager to have sex with him. By this point in NBA history, Bryant was already a tour de force and, whether or not he was asserting his authority over her, it rang in the air loud and clear. Another important component of the situation was the victim’s age. Only 19. If she had been slightly younger, she would have been considered a minor and this would have been a criminal offense whether or not consent was given. Imagine being a young woman, just out of high school, and one of the top athletes in the country asked you to do something. You would be far more likely to do it under these circumstances. Bryant should have known better. He knew the influence he wielded and the vulnerable stage this young person was at, in her maturity and decision-making process. But we’ll forgive him. We will read this story, feel a slight sense of unease, swallow it quickly and proceed to praise his achievements. We will shove the feeling down as we are so apt to do these days when we learn an influential person has manipulated young women. But when a female Washington Post reporter so much as mentioned the case on Twitter, she faced administrative leave. A punitive measure that far surpassed anything Bryant faced for actually committing the act. In this situation there were three players. A reporter trying to honor Bryant’s legacy whose entire career was put in jeopardy. A woman who was assaulted by Bryant at age 19 and has likely never been the same since. Perhaps she struggles to watch basketball or Nike ads on TV. Perhaps she can’t return to that hotel or city again. Perhaps her sleep has never been the same since. Perhaps her life has never been the same since. Consequences that are all quite commonplace after one faces sexual assault. And then there’s Bryant. Who walked away scot-free and went on to another 17 years of an illustrious career and lush retirement. I’m well past the point in even my young and idealistic life of believing that people ever face the consequences of sexual assault. In this country we punish sexual assault like we punish petty theft. But it hadn’t occurred to me until this case that we are so much more willing to forgive perpetrators than victims. We forgave Brock Turner. Punished him for a few months and released him to rape others soon after. Sure, he may have raped and mutilated an unconscious young woman, but he’s a great swimmer. We forgave Bill Cosby. Sure, he drugged and raped women but he made us laugh. We forgave Harvey Weinstein. Sure, he used his power to trick women into coming into his hotel rooms and violated them, but we still watch Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love. Bryant’s offense doesn’t rise to nearly the same level of criminality as the rest. But we will award him the same degree of slack and I’m sure we will award it to men after him if they, too, wield their clout shrewdly enough. This led me to think about an oft-used argument that makes my skin crawl. Perhaps my least favorite sentence in the English language. “Well, it ruined his career.”Perhaps swathes of women across the country will never be able to sleep again, never be able to have relationships again, never trust men again, never feel safe again. But, hey, it ruined his career.I’m sure if you asked Turner if he’d rather never compete in a swim tournament again or never be able to sleep again, he would gladly give up swimming. If you asked Weinstein if he’d rather retire early and coast on his fortune or never be able to feel safe again, he’d choose retirement. A ruined career is not tantamount to a ruined life. As we grieve the loss of Kobe Bryant, remember all the good he did. Remember the jaw-dropping games and the heart-breaking images of him and his family. Remember the Bryant you knew and loved, but don’t let this element of his past fade away. Remember it as tangibly as you remember his winning shots. Hold him accountable. You’d want Bryant’s assault case remembered if you were that young, impressionable 19-year-old girl. Dana is a senior studying Journalism and Theatre. Do you believe that we need to hold Kobe Bryant accountable despite his tragic death? How should sexual assault be handled when the perpetrator passes away?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/02/new-republican-proposal-for-dealing-with-sexual-assault-kits-threatens-previous-bipartisan-plan,"February 4, 2020 | 9:53pm CST","After the Department of Justice discovered almost 7,000 untested sexual assault kits in hospitals and law enforcement agencies across the state in 2014, Attorney General Josh Kaul and local lawmakers introduced the first state guidelines in Wisconsin on how to process them.However, a new Republican proposal to handle potential backlogs of sexual assault kits could unravel a bipartisan plan to address the issue.Rep. David Steffen, R-Green Bay, who initially proposed a bipartisan bill last year with Kaul, introduced a new option for the Assembly which includes more comprehensive instructions to keep sexual assault kits for a longer period of time.However, the proposals are likely to lose Democrat support. After initially refusing to hold a public hearing, Chairman of the Assembly Committee on Health Rep. Joe Sanfelippo, R-New Berlin, opposed the preliminary bill.Sanfelippo said the new and stronger requirements for the bill explains his support.“This is a much better bill — comprehensive — and it provides a better way for us to make sure a backlog doesn’t occur in the future,” Sanfelippo said. Under the original bill, which was passed by the Senate with widespread bipartisan support but stalled in the Assembly, health care professionals who collect sexual assault kits would be required to notify a law enforcement agency within 24 hours of collection if the survivor wants to report the assault. The new bill includes most of the initial proposals, but also incorporates more partisan policies that Republicans would favor.For example, there would be a requirement for law enforcement to notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of immigrants in the country illegally who are under arrest for sexual assault. Another proposal would allow sexual assault survivors access to private school vouchers even if they wouldn’t otherwise qualify based on income.Democratic Madison lawmakers, like Rep. Chris Taylor and Rep. Melissa Sargent, criticized the new bill, believing it has little chance for bipartisan support and puts politics above sexual assault survivors. Kaul stated this legislation would undermine the current bipartisan agreement to prevent a future backlog of sexual assault cases because of the new partisan provisions. “The legislation today is transparently intended to allow Assembly Republicans to pretend to support legislation that can help prevent another backlog, when in reality they are preventing such legislation — AB 214 — from becoming law,” Kaul said. state news writer",New Republican proposal for dealing with sexual assault kits threatens previous bipartisan plan,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/02/republican-sponsored-tougher-on-crime-policies-receives-widespread-backlash,"February 3, 2020 | 11:39am CST","Conflict arose Thursday during the Wisconsin State Assembly’s Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee meeting as lawmakers feuded over the Republican-proposed ""Tougher on Crime"" policies intended to combat crime. One proposed bill in the package calls upon the Department of Corrections to reincarcerate an individual if they commit a crime while on extended supervision, parole or probation. Another proposal would increase the list of violent crimes ineligible for parole or extended supervision. State Sen. David Craig, R-Big Bend, who sponsored the bill, attributed the crime rate in Milwaukee and its neighboring areas as justification for the legislation.“I continue to see news story after news story about repeat offenses, and the repeat offenses are becoming more and more aggravated and more and more serious and people are dying,” Craig said.In addition to pushback from Democrats, fellow Republican members on the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee criticized the set of bills.State Rep. Shelia Stubbs, D-Madison, insisted on utilizing community resources and providing support as the best way to reduce crime. “We have to stop isolating people and get them the services and the help they need,” Stubbs said. “I ask you to please reconsider the process in which you’re going to further incarcerate someone who has never really been given a fair chance.”State Rep. Michael Schraa, R-Oshkosh, questioned the financial feasibility of enacting the policies, particularly in re-incarcerating criminals.“This is going to cost the state a lot of money,” Schraa said.h. “My question is, where are we going to come up with the money for this?”A failed bill with similar intentions from the previous legislation session asked for $350 million to build more prison space.Schraa also referenced Wisconsin’s overpopulated prisons and stipulated the state’s carceral system cannot handle the greater incarceration rates the policies aim to create. A 2019 report from the state Legislature’s research office indicated Wisconsin prisons operated at 134 percent capacity in 2018. Multiple advocacy groups, including the Wisconsin Counties Association, Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Wisconsin Justice Initiative, Inc. signaled their opposition to the legislation.Another proposal looks to increase the list of crimes for which a juvenile could be incarcerated. This comes amid the state’s efforts to close two of its largest — and troubled — juvenile detention centers.The package also includes bills relating to domestic violence court cases, including one proposal to which would make  any attempt to intimidate a victim of domestic abuse before they take the stand a felony.Jenna Gormal, the Public Policy Coordinator at End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin, argued this proposal does not serve in the best interests of domestic violence survivors.“Survivors across the state are not telling us that we need to be tougher in sentencing, they’re telling us that they need affordable housing and child care, they’re telling us their partners need help and they’re telling us that incarceration is not justice,” Gormal said.Another proposal would allow victims to testify through video or deposition rather than in court.These proposed bills have yet been voted on. This legislative session is expected to conclude at the end of the month, meaning there is only a small window of time for these bills to proceed. Gov. Tony Ever’s office have opposed many of the bills, and indicated if the bills made their way through the legislature, he would likely veto the measures.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/01/a-look-into-know-my-name-by-chanel-miller,"January 30, 2020 | 6:00am CST","It has been less than a year since Emily Doe, the survivor of the infamous 2015 Stanford sexual assault case, bravely revealed her identity as Chanel Miller. In October of 2019, Chanel Miller published her memoir titled “Know My Name” where she details her life before, during and after her assault with incredible honesty and fearlessness. Immediately after I read this book over winter break, I knew I wanted to share my praise for Miller as her courage is admirable and her savvy writing inspires. If the Stanford sexual assault case doesn’t ring a bell for you, let me refresh your memory: In 2015, a freshman Stanford swimmer by the name of Brock Turner sexually assaulted a woman behind a dumpster. The case garnered intense media attention because Turner was a privileged, white, elite athlete with whom a good portion of the American public sided with, claiming it would be such a shame if he was convicted and his life ruined over a “small” mistake. Chanel would read comments on media walls such as “But he’s such a GOOD boy, surely he couldn’t have done this,” “She’s lying!” and even comments along the lines of “It was her fault she was so drunk! I heard she was wearing a short dress too.” Her memoir allows the reader not only an incredibly personal look at how the assault affected her work, relationships and mental health, but grants us access into the mind of someone vilified by the modern media. The People v. Turner case attracted additional media attention when Miller, still concealed as Emily Doe, read a victim impact statement at Turner’s sentencing. Her statement went viral, attracting a response from former President Barack Obama to thousands of sexual assault survivors who praised her ability to encapsulate what it means to be a survivor of assault. Her statement has been read over 11 million times and counting. Ultimately, Brock Turner was convicted of three counts of felony assault. However, his jail sentence of only six months, which he served half, caused national outcry which focused on the inequities of the justice system and left Miller and other survivors questioning the worth of their bodies. For years she attempted to distance herself from this identity of “Emily Doe,” but her desire to separate her identity as a victim and as the Chanel who existed and thrived before her assault was impossible. She could no longer do work she used to love, could no longer feel safe walking in the daylight and her life revolved around ever-changing yet numerous court dates. By writing this deeply sad yet empowering book, Chanel Miller exposes the faults of our criminal and judiciary systems and forces readers to think about how sexual assault cases should be handled. Finally, she candidly reveals how sexual assault affects all aspects of one’s life and doesn’t simply go away with time, therapy or even support from friends and family. Her bravery has inspired thousands to come forward with their stories and I truly believe her book has and will change the way we talk about and address sexual assault in this country. I urge you to read this memoir. In fact, I beg you to take the time to thoughtfully decipher Chanel Miller’s message through a narrative that will undoubtedly leave a mark on modern American culture.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/11/a-toxic-environment-the-other-costs-of-greek-life-housing,"November 18, 2021 | 9:00am CST","The University of Wisconsin-Madison student housing scene is peppered with run-down apartments, decade-old houses and historic dorm buildings. Yet, tucked away behind the bustling State Street businesses lies Langdon street, a neighborhood lined with picturesque mansions, a lakeside view and dozens of students involved in one overarching organization: Greek life.Participating in Greek life is typically known to be a sizable expenditure — choosing to live in a fraternity house can cost anywhere from $4,200 to $18,000 a year, according to the Interfraternity Council. According to the Panhellenic Association, living in a sorority house can range from $7,700 to $11,980 a year. In addition to live-in costs, semesterly membership dues, which also range in price, are required of all members.But for UW-Madison senior Maya Cherins, living in a sorority house during her sophomore year  presented challenges that were greater than cost. Cherins said that her experiences in the sorority house created a detrimental situation for her mental health, particularly because conversations among members were often centered around diet and eating disorder culture.“I remember there were weeks leading up to [spring break] where people would talk about their spring break diets,” Cherins said. “And I wasn’t on a spring break diet, because that’s not who I am.”Cherins was constantly surrounded by such discussions, and she noted that the lack of alone time while living in the house contributed to the negative experience.“It was just really hard to be in that environment where everyone's comparing themselves the entire time,” she said.Cherins eventually decided to drop her sorority at the end of her sophomore year after being sent home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Everybody was devastated to be sent home because of COVID and everything,” Cherins said. “But at the same time, I was like, the sooner I can get out of this house, the better. I just thought it was a pretty toxic environment. “Both Cherins and senior Molly Kehoe, who is also a former member of Greek life, said they were able to meet their best friends through Greek life. However, they said the social atmosphere of their sororities also fostered drama and cliques between women.Social media often contributes to problems of exclusion, according to Kehoe.“I think it just creates a lot of toxicity to pretend like you have the greatest friend group of all time,” Kehoe said. “The whole narrative of, ‘I absolutely love these lifelong sisters’ — I think it's just a bad message to send that you have this perfect friendship with all these people. That's not realistic, and it makes people feel like shit.”Despite advertising itself as a place for diversity and inclusion, Kehoe said the Greek life system in general systematically excludes many women, which can contribute to feelings of cliquiness within the houses.“It’s very ‘one size fits some,’” Kehoe said. “If you’re not white, wealthy and straight, it's not meant for you.”‘A heavy drinking scene’The promise of a buzzing social life draws many to become involved with Greek life, according to Cherins and Kehoe.“I think the social aspect of it is great if that's the scene you want to be in, because it's very much a heavy drinking scene,” Cherins said.Prior to living in her sorority house, Cherins enjoyed the social aspect of Greek life. However, she said the pressure to frequently attend parties and drink created a stressful situation upon living in the house.“By the time I was living in the house, I felt like there was definitely the pressure to go out and go to these fraternities and get drunk and all this stuff,” Cherins said. “It just felt like a horrible cycle.”For Kehoe, a similar pressure made her feel uncomfortable and unwelcome in her sorority due to her introverted personality.“Beyond the appearance on social media, I felt like I had to embody this persona that I wasn't,” Kehoe said. “And they definitely don't tell you that during recruitment.”Aside from the peer pressure, the environment of fraternity parties is one that has become associated with sexual assault and rape culture over the years on a national scale. “I've known way too many people in Greek life and in college in general that have been survivors of sexual assault,” Cherins said. “All of which have been survivors of sexual assault to people in fraternities. And it's just disgusting.” Kehoe reiterated that the atmosphere creates pressure and discomfort. “It’s just this blind reality of people trying to force you into social environments that they perceive to be good for their own social standing, when it's not for everyone else,” Kehoe added.AcademicsThe average GPA for fraternities and sororities (including multicultural organizations) is a 3.533 in comparison to the all campus GPA average of 3.527, according to UW-Madison Student Affairs. Yet, Cherins said the highly social atmosphere of her sorority house made studying difficult. “I ended up always being in [the sorority house study room] with friends,” Cherins said. “So it was a hard environment to actually get work done. If I wanted to do work at the house, it had to be work that I could do while being social.”On the other hand, Kehoe said the ability to easily form study groups based on sorority membership was one of the benefits of being involved with her organization. “I could just message on our Facebook and be like, ‘Is anyone taking this class?’ And then instantly have a study group,” Kehoe said. “ Even though I didn't even know those people, I would just become friends with them by nature of knowing their names.”Current sorority member and junior Kate O’Leary said her sorority has allowed her to thrive academically based on the academic benefits offered to chapter members through study plans.“Academics are well supported through my sorority having different study plans based on academic achievement and standings within the chapter,” O’Leary said. “Having mandatory academic study halls, tracking my study hours, and having specific sponsors for older members with a similar major who I can rely on allow me to achieve my goals with grades and career trajectories.”A larger issueAfter dropping their sororities, Cherins and Kehoe, along with senior Maggie Jay, published an article in Bell Magazine calling for the abolishment of traditional Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Association Greek life. Throughout the piece, Cherins, Kehoe and Jay discuss the problematic history of Greek life, including racist roots, hazing traditions, sexual assault in Greek life and the perpetuation of eating disorder culture in sororities. The article ultimately calls to abolish — rather than reform—Greek life at UW-Madison because the national system promotes an exclusionary environment, historically rooted in white supremacy. Cherins emphasized that while UW-Madison Greek life may be unproblematic in itself, the overall system of Greek life historically perpetuates racism, classism and sexism.“The point isn't that I had a terrible experience,” Kehoe said. “The point is that it's a terrible system. And you should be able to step outside of yourself and say, ‘I care about the system and the way it impacts people outside of it, more than I care about my own social life.’”Overall, Kehoe said the issues within Greek life houses often outweigh the positive aspects.“I think you'll find fun, amazing social people in Greek life, but there are so many other ways to do it,” Kehoe said. “It's expensive and it's problematic. So if you can avoid it, just don't do it.”",‘A toxic environment’: The other costs of Greek life housing,UWM

The bill is sponsored by Rep. Erin Tritz, Diverse Engagement Coordinator Ndemazea Fonkem, Rep. Kunal Sanwalka and Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment (PAVE).The legislation emphasizes that the need for this bill stems from the unchanged statistics in sexual assault reports on campus. On campus, less than half of students are aware of the University Health Services Survivor Services or know that Title IX is a reporting office, according to legislation sponsors. ASM recognizes that “the majority of the work advocating falls on registered student organizations. There are many systemic issues in place that need to be addressed on a structural level as this issue impacts thousands of students on campus.”If the formation of this committee is approved, they will work alongside predetermined organizations that have been working to reduce the stigma of sexual violence on campus, including PAVE, Sex Out Loud, STIXA, Culture of Respect, Embark and Relationship FLAGS, among others.The anti-violence campus coordinator will be a currently enrolled student at UW-Madison that will be appointed by the student council at the first meeting of each session. The position description outlines that “they will serve as a liaison between ASM and violence-prevention organizations on campus.”The coordinator will stay well informed on the agendas of all external UW-Madison sexual violence prevention organizations as well as campus-sponsored offices. They will be the spokesperson for ASM to ensure that they will be centering the needs of survivors and honoring the identities and experiences of marginalized communities disproportionately impacted by any kind of violence.",Anti-violence legislation to be introduced at ASM meeting,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/11/wisconsins-assembly-approves-package-of-anti-abortion-bills,"November 2, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","The Republican controlled assembly in Wisconsin sent a package of anti-abortion bills to Gov. Tony Evers on Wednesday. Evers, a Democrat, vetoed similar bills sent to him two years ago, and is likely to reject them again.“Wisconsin Republicans were able to rush these anti-abortion bills through the legislative process, simply due to partisan gerrymandering,” said Rep. Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) in a press release. “These wildly unpopular policies take personal healthcare decisions about pregnancy and give them to politicians.”“This is a political game being played by Republicans to gin up their base,” said Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison). Subeck noted that while the bills are being sent to Gov. Evers, who is bound to veto them, Republicans may still be going through with the proposal in an attempt to “energize conservatives ahead of the 2022 midterm election.”According to the Associated Press, one of the bills “would impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance in which a baby is born alive following an abortion attempt.” Doctors claim the bill is creating a problem out of something they insist is so rare. In the rare case there is a failed abortion attempt, doctors are “ethically and legally bound to try and keep them alive.”“This is not an anti-abortion bill,” Republican Majority Leader Jim Steineke said. “This is simply a bill that’s simply about protecting the lives of children that survive an abortion attempt.”Another bill would ban abortions based on sex, requiring doctors to provide expecting parents information about innate conditions and additionally reduce government funding for organizations that offer abortion services. Evers vetoed this bill in 2019.Exceptions of this bill will only be in the cases of sexual assault, incest or if the woman’s life is in danger.A fifth bill would require doctors to tell any woman seeking a medication-induced abortion that she could still continue the pregnancy after taking the first dose. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and American Medical Association have criticized claims that abortions can be reversed, especially as it pertains to political threat this puts on the patient’s life.“Even though we have seen these tactics before, it is worth repeating: abortion is healthcare. Choosing to have an abortion is a deeply personal decision that should be reserved for the pregnant person and their doctor,” said Hesselbein. “No one else should intervene in these healthcare decisions, especially not a male-dominated legislature.”",Wisconsin’s Assembly approves package of anti-abortion bills,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/10/why-vagina-cupcakes-are-essential-to-sex-education-a-hearty-review-of-netflixs-new-season,"October 7, 2021 | 1:00am CDT","Recently, Netflix came out with their third and final season of “Sex Education,” a show in which the son of a sex therapist starts a commercial “sex education” clinic at his school in order to subsidize the crappy education the school gives. Touching on subjects as common as the pressure to lose one's virginity to things such as Vaginismus, the show truly accomplishes what its leading character Otis seeks to do: educate teenagers about the subjects they thought were taboo. Rotten Tomatoes says the new season is as “raunchy and riotous as ever,” but even with its shockingly explicit scenes and British setting, the show is much more socially valuable than another raunchy go. Probably the wildest installment of the show yet, with the most strange twists, this season is particularly important in that it examines a fair amount of more nuanced topics and gives representation to so many different situations and groups, even more so than before. With the current nomination of a Supreme Court packed with conservative judges, Texas’ passing of harsher laws regarding women's reproductive rights, and general women’s and LGBTQ+ rights issues cropping up all around the world, this fresh take on relationships and sexual health is a vital thing to be put into the world. The season begins with Moordale getting a new principal after the scandal of season two. Hope, the new principal, seems cool and relatable at first, but quickly she turns darker and darker, engaging in the extreme emotional abuse of some students. Obviously somewhat satirical in nature, her character still highlights the false ideas that educators have about children in schools all over the world. Hope returns the school back to supporting abstinence only and creates gender segregated sex ed, causing a mass panic about sexual fears. She attempts to crush the leading characters’ spirits, refusing to give proper information, not allowing nonbinary and transgender students to wear and participate in the identities they feel most comfortable with and instituting uniforms and strict school guidelines on student productions and clubs. Obviously, this results in a spicy rebellion, but you’ll have to watch to find out the conclusion. In response to this, students discuss how harmful bad sex education is, as well as echoing a pro-choice sentiment. We also get to see transgender students bonding together and establishing that gender is a social construct, and that being allowed to present comfortably is essential to success. Lastly, individuality — even in a vulgar manner — is emphasized, with Lily struggling to feel okay with raunchy creativity, the “wall of pensises” being painted over and replaced with something else and students performing their own, out of school drama pieces. Aside from this, the season also touches on a sexual assault case with Aimee, and her ability to genuinely  talk through it in a positive way and not be shamed for it, as well as her boyfriend being supportive and caring throughout it all. This is an important thing for young minds to see: sexual assault is not the victims’ fault at all. Differing LGBTQ+ perspectives are also seen in not only the nonbinary and transgender representation, accompanying  season two’s excellent portrayal of asexuality. Eric goes to Nigeria, despite fears of homophobia there, and finds  confidence in himself after being exposed to a broader range of LGBTQ+ identities. Adam also struggles with being perceived as gay and working through toxic masculinity issues. Even adults get a toehold in this season, as we see Adam's dad struggle with his divorce, his mom becoming more comfortable in her sexuality and our star therapist Jean struggling as an elderly parent with a new partner. There truly is something for everyone. Overall, this season was a much needed loud, aggressive endeavour into how truly in need of self expression and safe education our modern teenagers are. It catches your eye and forces you to pay attention to needed social lessons about topics most, even those who agree, are afraid to breach. Featuring — obviously — a central titular romance, explicit wild situations and even positive information about kinks and sexting, there is still room for a soft nonbinary discovery scene, cute friendships and vagina decorated cupcakes. Of course, we’d love to see more, but the effect of this show being out on television now is phenomenal. Keeping teenagers in the dark is never good, and this show in its final season highlights it all.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/09/reported-sexual-assault-in-southeast-residence-hall-among-many-other-cases-not-formally-reported,"September 24, 2021 | 11:15pm CDT","A sexual assault in a Southeast residence hall Sunday was reported in a “Crime Warning” email sent to the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus community on Monday. Because the alleged victim has not filed a police report, there remains no active police investigation into the incident. Instead, the case is being handled by the Sexual Misconduct Resource and Response Program formally known as the Title IX program. This case is not alone. From July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021, UW-Madison has received 139 claims of sexual assault or sexual violence on behalf of students. Out of those 139, only 15 incidents have gone through formal investigations by police or by the Sexual Misconduct Resource and Response Program office. “Only a fairly small number of students who experience an assault request a formal investigation,” said program coordinator Lauren Hasselbacher, JD. “In the vast majority of cases, the Title IX office does not press for students to file formal complaints in order to respect personal choice and autonomy.”Despite no formal police investigation, the university has a legal obligation to report information related to incidents on or around campus, or that represent an “ongoing threat to [campus] community so faculty, students and staff can take necessary steps to protect themselves,” said UW Spokesperson Meredith McGlone. “The university is committed to providing the full range of supportive measures, regardless of whether the individual chooses to make a formal complaint to the police or through the university,” McGlone said. These support services include advocacy, mental health services and medical services through University Health Services, as well as providing academic and housing accommodations with protective measures, such as no-contact directives. These directives prohibit the alleged perpetrator from making contact with the victim, with additional instructions provided in instances where the students share a residence hall or are taking the same course. The university does not press students to report sexual assault as a practical matter, as investigations are unlikely to bear fruit if the student does not want to cooperate, Hasselbacher said. However, there are rare exceptions to this policy.“It often varies based on the nature of the allegations, but if it has been deemed to not be an ongoing safety threat, there is a legal obligation as well as university policy to not discipline prior to an investigation,” said Hasselbacher. “However, we do put into place general protective measures including no-contact orders. Violation of these orders will result in further investigations and additional charges being placed onto the [accused].” “For students who allege that the attack took place by someone else in the same residence hall, the no-contact order could justify putting the [accused] into another residence hall,” or by separating them by some other means, Hasselbacher said. “If the [accused] is in a position of trust, we would also employ additional special protective measures.”Additionally, 10 students whose cases were investigated requested an alternative solution with the alleged perpetrator — which were granted in all cases — and two students were granted housing accommodations related to their alleged assault. These numbers do not include instances of sexual harassment, dating/domestic violence, stalking or sexual exploitation, which are also handled by Sexual Misconduct Resource and Response. “The email we received earlier this week is certainly not the only incident on our campus and the Madison community,” said PAVE president Jessica Melnik. “I hope a greater awareness of the issue will lead to fewer instances of violence, more support for survivors and a campus that practices a culture of consent in all of our interactions with each other.”“Sexual assault is never the survivor’s fault,” Melnik concluded. “And reporting violence is often made more difficult by institutional barriers that perpetuate victim-blaming and re-traumatization through the process.” Sexual violence prevention and survivor support resources can be found here.

As chair of the department, I am committed to fostering a safe, healthy climate and to treating reports of sexual assault and misconduct with the utmost seriousness. I encourage survivors to reach out for information and support, including using confidential resources like Survivor Services. The university’s Sexual Misconduct Resource and Response Program has followed up with the Daily Cardinal providing information to be shared with the letter writer, in hopes that they will share information that will allow the university to further investigate.Like many works of theatre, there is a diversity of opinions about the play “Rashomon.” Our faculty and staff engaged in a vigorous dialogue about this production. Many works of art, including plays, feature controversial and uncomfortable depictions. It is through freely exploring complex topics that society can learn from them. The play’s major themes resound for the times we are in now. Our artistic directors have reflected on the value of this production, and it raises important themes such as the nature of truth and the need to sift and ponder and seek it out. How can an audience see the relative and elusive nature of truth presented on stage? How does such an exercise play into our understanding of current events, where we are seeing different narratives on a variety of issues told from different perspectives?  After careful consideration, we decided to move forward with offering the production of ""Rashomon"" while taking steps to acknowledge the content of the play and preparing audiences for such content. The playbill for this production includes a content warning for depictions of physical violence and sexual assault and information on campus resources for survivors.It is my hope that we continue to work together to support a safe and vibrant culture within the department.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/09/letter-to-the-editor-uws-theatre-department-perpetuates-rape-culture,"September 2, 2021 | 12:09pm CDT","When I was six years old, I was sexually assaulted. I learned that day that my body would never be safe as long as men saw my needs as worthless. My existence since has been tailored to protect me. I’ve looked over my shoulder often, and I’ve found men following me home. I’ve avoided and blocked men I know who are twice my age who’ve stalked me online. I’ve held my tongue as men catcall me. I’ve been warned about rapists - one is even a part of the UW-Madison theatre department. And this year, I’ve written this in response to UW-Madison theatre’s sexist play Rashomon as it ultimately supports this rape culture I’ve run from.Rashomon has two female characters: “The Wife” and “The Mother”…literally. That being said, the Wife actually has a complex role. Unfortunately, though, the language and events of the play surrounding the Wife are sexist and make fun of rape. The Bandit gleefully describes his planned and executed rape. In response, a character claims women enjoy being had by this rapist. The husband is angry with the Wife for not killing herself after the rape. After unsuccessfully attempting to drown herself, she asks if she “is really that worthless?"" Directly afterward, a character mocks these words. This character gives us some other gems, such as how it’s hard to know what is on the minds of women and how women always cry. The play also continuously spouts phrases that objectify women. For instance, the Bandit says rich womens' hands look like toys.During the play, I was recoiling in my seat reminded of how I’ve been treated. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, “Among undergraduate students, 26.4% of females and 6.8% of males experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation."" 1 in 4 women. 1 in 20 men. And even more people of different genders, abilities and ages. And how disappointing that the Wife is depicted as weak, dirty and deserving of death due to her apparent 'contamination'. Victims of sexual assault and rape are much more likely to have PTSD, depression and drug dependencies. Depicting them so darkly only adds to the isolation and pain that assault causes.The most disappointing part for me is that these statistics aren’t new. Ever since the Me Too movement, awareness of rape culture has risen; the department probably knew that many students had experienced rape/sexual assault. Additionally, the truth is there are rapists among the department; in the playbill, I had the joy of seeing that an alleged rapist and someone who stalked me on social media is listed as a donor to the program. I’ve been speaking out against sexism and rape culture, and so have many of the other students. But we are still ignored simply because the university wanted to do this show.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/05/the-first-step-is-listening-pave-hosts-denim-day-in-support-of-survivors-of-sexual-assault,"May 2, 2021 | 8:42pm CDT","Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment, the Panhellenic Association and the Interfraternity Council co-sponsored a march Wednesday in protest of sexual assault and in support of survivors. The “Take Back the Night March” made its path down Langdon Street, the home to many fraternity and sorority houses on campus, before turning towards the capitol where students heard from several survivors of sexual assault. The march took place on Denim Day, the third Wednesday of April when people globally wear denim to show support and empower survivors of sexual assault. The march took on a similar approach and was survivor-centered, said PAVE-UW Chair Eli Tsarovsky. The number of students who attended the march far surpassed what PAVE had expected, said Tsarovsky. “I was looking back and I was like ‘Am I dreaming?’” Tsarovsky said. “I did not realize that people would show out like this. I really speechless at this point, that was probably the coolest thing I've ever done in my life.”While student-led marches and protests usually walk down State Street, the Denim Day March instead walked down Langdon, where the majority of PHA and IFC chapter houses are located. It was important for PHA and IFC to be involved in the march because of the prevalence of sexual assault in their communities, said PHA VP of External Affairs Caitlin Geurts.Students were surprised, not just by the number of march attendees, but by the number of men who came to the march to show their support. “I'm really happy they showed up, because they too understand this is a problem in our community and are here to support us, and they're here to change it — it's awesome,” Geurts said. IFC was motivated to join the march with PAVE as a way of taking ownership of and starting conversations about sexual assault, said IFC President Liam McLean. “The receptiveness was the greatest part because, at the end of the day, the most important thing was for people to listen, to hear and to get introspective with themselves,” McLean said. Clad in denim, students marched to the capitol to hear survivors of sexual assault share their experiences. “The first step is listening,” McLean said before handing the megaphone over.“We live in a college environment and to say that there isn't a rape culture on a college campus is kind of crazy,” said sophomore Benji Gelfend. “There [are] definitely bad things that go on here and I think a lot of people are scared to talk about it. And I think fear is definitely not the answer. The answer is coming together and going against it together because otherwise, we won't be able to do anything.”The march closed out a month-long event calendar that PAVE put together for Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April. “I hope this builds a lot of momentum for seeing change on campus,” Tsarovsky said. “We need to do more to heal this community and really help people because it's a public health crisis on campus and in our country.” ",‘The first step is listening’: PAVE hosts Denim Day in support of survivors of sexual assault,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/a-year-in-review,"April 29, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","Welcome BackEntering the school year, students and faculty alike were anxious for how the semester would look. How would the pandemic affect day-to-day campus operations, and could we return “safely” back to campus? In just five days, the question was answered when Chancellor Blank directed all undergraduate students to enter a lockdown after the astronomic increase of COVID-19 cases. Some combination of the University’s lack of testing, lack of foresight and expectation that our “restart” would be better than other schools that had already tried — and failed — to re-open led us to the question: What did you expect was going to happen?Both Witte and Sellery residence halls were closed shortly thereafter, following another two hour notice to prepare for a two week lockdown. The first week of students returning to campus produced one of the craziest — yet highly expected — outcomes. In addition to the litany of other stressors faced by students, pandemic stressors as a result of the universities actions — or rather inactions — were not at all remedied. Students were expected to perform academically at the same level as any other semester, were expected to use the invasive Honorlock platform and were not offered a pass-fail option.March MayhemLet us first give credit where credit is due: The spring and fall commencements last year were rightly cancelled, and the cautious return to an in-person event this May is appropriate. Despite the emotional toll on seniors of not getting to walk like they may have envisioned, these decisions make sense in the interest of health and safety. However, the decision to advertise basketball tickets for March Madness in Indiana — a state with no mask mandate — while enforcing limits and restrictions on other crowds reeks of hypocrisy.The inconsistency of policies is a reflection of the priorities of the university administration. Academic accomplishment at a leading, research-oriented university takes a backseat because ticket sales make far more money, even if it is at the expense of students’ health. Students have made insurmountable sacrifices in academic pursuit. They have fended off personal and social misfortunes, and the extreme physical tolls of regular screen time and vastly varying time zones, to name a few things. All this simply to stay afloat. Yet it all comes undone when tickets are advertised and sold in order to fill the coffers. Those privileged enough to not have to think about sacrifices oblige by paying for tickets and acting irresponsibly, affecting those who wished no part in it at all. Despite some fair decisions, by virtue of selling tickets to basketball games, the university has actively aided and abetted selfish practices that have caused great pain to those simply watching from afar and wishing for this nightmare to end. No Spring Break BurnoutIn the fall, students suffered left and right, from experiencing lockdown in tightly packed dorm rooms, to packing their bags for quarantine housing to actually contracting COVID-19. On top of financial and food insecurity and even election-related stress, the push to work under business-as-usual truly took its toll, especially for students of color.One University Health Services Associate Psychologist Dr. Corey Steele said that student mental health demand was “greater than ever.” Despite pleas from student representatives for a pass/fail option, the university carried on as normal.After a semester of isolation, lockdown and immense pressure to keep up with schoolwork, students felt additional accumulative stress brought by COVID-19 this spring. Students could seldom find opportunities to connect in-person with classmates. Some lost loved ones to the coronavirus and others had no choice but to work in a completely different time zone. Instead of addressing student grievances, the work piled on. It never stopped. The university’s attempt to rectify the situation came too late into the semester. Officials did not decide to offer a spring semester special grading policy until April 5 — one month short of this exhausting year finally coming to an end. But what changed between the fall and the spring? University officials cite the “cumulative impact” of COVID-19. However, the stakes were just as high in the fall, when students were burdened by the fear of falling ill with the virus, let alone a family member, friend or roommate.Though the risk of travelling and spreading the virus was absolutely necessary to acknowledge this spring, so too were the ongoing struggles faced by students. Holding a Mental Health & Wellbeing Summit is no help when students are spending hours upon hours online anyway. Neither are three “Mental Health Days,” the majority of which were held over the weekend.Although the university extended the deadline to drop a class, their late notice about a new grading policy failed students, as did their disregard to offer proper time for students to rejuvenate amidst surviving a pandemic.Student leaders shut out of financial relief plansThe university also chose not to take up students’ concerns when it came to their more material needs throughout this pandemic school year. At the start of this semester, it was clear that students were struggling to keep up with rent and utilities. Concerned for their peers — and that federal aid coming through the university couldn’t go towards helping noncitizen students — the Associated Students of Madison aimed to divert their reserve funds into a COVID-19 Student Relief Fund. Ultimately, those funds were left on the table as the administration claimed it violated UW System policy against gifts to students. Rather than help ASM find a legal way to use that money to help struggling students, they stonewalled the effort and the good intentions behind it. While ASM spent months bringing amendments and probing loopholes to force the fund through, UW administrators rested on their legal argument while $2 million — money paid by students and rightfully controlled by their student government representatives — sat unused. In response, ASM passed a well-deserved vote of No Confidence in Laurent Heller, vice-chancellor of Finance and Administration and the university’s pointman on the relief fund, because of his refusal to engage with their efforts. Heller responded last week by announcing his departure from the university. At the same time that the university was holding $2 million in unused segregated fees hostage, they were once again forcing graduate students to pay even more of those same fees for the privilege of working at the university. In the form of mandatory fees, UW takes back around 10% of graduate students’ salaries — a practice that clearly amounts to wage theft. For years the Teaching Assistants Association has lobbied for an end to the fees for grad workers. This semester, as its members face more dire financial straits, the union organized to withhold their funds until their due date, in the hopes that the university might throw them a bone. No dice.The university claims to care about student wellbeing. We are keen to believe them. But what we have seen more clearly this year is their contempt for any student-led effort to improve that wellbeing. The continued battle for racial equityBeyond the trials and tribulations of our campus, on April 20, a collective sigh of relief was felt — not only across campus but across the country — as guilty verdicts were announced during the Derek Chauvin case. Despite the murder of George Floyd being recorded and witnessed across the world, there was worry and anxiety over what the verdict would be that Tuesday afternoon. That uneasiness, though, speaks volumes about our so-called justice system and who it truly serves. Sure, Chauvin was held accountable for his heinous actions; but, the system which initially allowed his murder still holds. During the course of the trial, police officers killed Daunte Wright, body camera footage of Adam Toledo’s shooting was released and countless others lost their lives to police brutality and gun violence. Though this guilty verdict has brought a fleeting sense of peace, it does not escape us that thousands of incidents of police brutality go unrecorded and don’t even make it to court. As such, this rare conviction of Derek Chauvin does not negate the need to reconstruct the criminal justice system. Rather, it marks the need for continued activism and disruption. As countless law enforcement officials have gone on with impunity, the Chauvin trial marks a long-fought, yet continuing battle for racial equity — yet another beginning in the pursuit of justice. As students, it highlights that there is still much to reform and rebuild under the institutions in which we operate. The Year in ReviewOverall, the university administration has continuously demonstrated their lack of care for student’s mental health. Instead, they have proven to us that we are cash cows — bodies that just pay the bills and allow the university to keep the lights on until they can overcharge the next incoming class of freshmen. But, this also has given campus a stronger sense of community: a common enemy to be united against. Students felt a sense of camaraderie as they waited in long lines at the beginning of the spring semester to get a COVID-19 spit test (drooling into a tube never has never felt so normal). We have breathed a collective sigh of relief at the Chauvin trial, and we’re all equally confused at the university’s conflicting rhetoric, from no spring break to encouragement for students to watch the men’s basketball team play in a state with no mask mandate. Throughout it all, we have suffered through an awful year — a year filled with institutions failing to do their jobs to take care of the people they promised to and forcing individuals to place pressure for change and accountability.Important questions remain: How will we take what we learned this year into the next year? How will we as students continue to keep other students safe when we go back to in-person classes, no longer plagued by an infectious disease but instead by the silent killers of food insecurity, sexual assault and mental health crises? This is the question we should be asking ourselves and our fellow students, and this is the question that will — hopefully — spark meaningful conversations with the University on how they treat their students as we move forward.",A year in review: An ongoing fight for student justice,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/continuously-unsafe-uw-admissions-puts-student-sexual-assault-survivors-at-risk,"April 29, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","Some names have been changed due to privacy concerns.Sophomore Avery Kendall abruptly left the BBCollaborate meeting during his spring semester UW-Madison physics discussion when he overheard a classmate mention that her roommate, Heidi, had graduated from Cambridge High School. Kendall’s classmate was confused and brought it up to her roommate in passing. Heidi then warned her roommate to be wary of Kendall and stated that she would personally rather fail the class than be his lab partner. “I would [have] advised [the TA] not to make any other girls his lab partner for their safety,"" she reflected.Heidi had a good reason for her concern. In 2019, during Kendall’s senior year at CHS, he videotaped two classmates undressing to “full nudity” without their knowledge or consent. Everyone involved was under eighteen at the time.According to Wisconsin Circuit Court Records, Kendall pled guilty to two Class-A Misdemeanors on charges of invasion of privacy via use of a surveillance device. He was sentenced to 50 hours of community service and two years of probation, forbidden to contact either of the women he recorded. That probation ended on March 19, 2021. Sexual assault survivors and CHS graduates reported finding UW-Madison’s treatment of the case alarming; they feel that the university prioritized profits over student safety by failing to warn students of the possible risks posed by students with a history of sexual misconduct on campus. They cited a lack of transparency, stating that Kendall’s case is just another example of a dangerous pattern that perpetuates rape culture and actively endangers vulnerable students. Multiple classmates knew Kendall planned on attending Purdue University after graduating from CHS, and they felt compelled to alert Purdue’s admissions office to Kendall’s convictions. He was “not a current nor admitted student” after Grace, a 2015 graduate of CHS, sent two emails with articles detailing the criminal case. Grace emailed UW-Madison admissions, housing and financial aid departments the same information multiple times and never received a response. Kendall is currently an engineering student at UW-Madison; he participates in campus activities and is a member of the waterskiing team.  “This man who we've been close with is that type of person that's so disturbing, especially because he was so nice and sweet. It just makes you think that you can't trust anyone,” said Edie. “All your fears are validated that you can't trust anyone, which is really sad and scary. It's so sad.” Peyton, a CHS graduate and UW-Madison freshman, recalled feeling her worldview permanently shift when a detective informed her that authorities had found the nude videos of her on Kendall’s phone. “I was like, ‘Holy shit. I can't believe this.’ [He was] one of [my] friends, this is just disgusting. I was just overwhelmed right away. Kind of like [I was] in shock,” Peyton said. Cambridge High School encouraged Peyton to stay quiet about what had happened to protect the school’s reputation. She stated that Kendall was allowed to finish his senior year from home, only stepping on school grounds before and after school to get class materials. CHS banned Kendall from partaking in any school concerts, but allowed him to come back to see a play and offered to let him walk at graduation, according to Peyton. She felt unsafe and dismissed by CHS’s response, and that almost held her back from attending her dream college: UW-Madison. “At first I was not sure if I even wanted to come here, but I was the one who liked it,” Peyton said. “I thought ‘you know what? Madison is my school; I need to go there. I can't be afraid.’ I believe I'm stronger than him. I believe he’s pathetic, and thank God I do.” Peyton saw Kendall playing spikeball on the lawn in front of Gordon’s Dining Hall on one of her first days on campus and immediately removed herself from her new group of friends. Peyton stated that they expressed concern because she “looked like she had seen a ghost.” To avoid another encounter with Kendall, Peyton reached out to the Title IX Office which offered to help rearrange her schedule while leaving Kendall's intact, and Peyton felt that this placed the burden on her and made her feel like “the problem.” Meredith McGlone, UW-Madison spokeswoman, stated that if UW-Madison’s Title IX Office is notified, they will “typically reach out to offer any appropriate supportive and protective measures,” such as a no-contact directive. She encourages students to reach out to Title IX with questions or concerns, because the University is not aware of “all such cases” that exist on campus.However, UW-Madison does not ask students to disclose criminal history or school disciplinary history, following suit with the Common Application decision to omit questions related to a criminal record.“We need to work harder to fix this,” Peyton said. “I'm opening up so that people know that this happens to people, but [they] aren't alone in this.”Grace highlighted what she calls hypocrisy within UW’s decision to admit and enroll Kendall while aware of his convictions, considering past statements they’ve put out about preventing sexual assault.“We remain committed to preventing sexual misconduct, supporting survivors and investigating complaints in a timely, impartial manner that respects the due process rights of all involved,” Chancellor Rebecca Blank wrote in a University-wide email sent in May of 2020, concerning changes to Title IX. Grace shared the above Tweet in 2019 to alert UW-Madison’s Administration of Kendall’s charges. UW-Madison responded, acknowledging that they were aware of the situation before admitting him.“I’m warning you directly that if you want to protect your students, this is a student who’s capable of causing material harm and there’s a legal record proving it,” Grace said of how she communicated with the University. “They were just like, ‘Fuck you. We don’t care.’” This isn’t the only situation where UW-Madison has been put under scrutiny for how they handle sexual assault cases and prevention. In 2015, the university went under federal investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for possible violations of federal law when addressing sexual violence and harassment complaints. Zoe Waters, an advocate for sexual abuse survivors and founder of Necessary Behavior, points to universities as being responsible for creating safe campus environments. In many cases, this means taking a victim-first approach to violence prevention.“This can look like a few different things, but it's a way to stop violence before it begins by providing information to students about what violence is, the impact of trauma on the mind and body and educating folks about gender roles, sex ed, consent, sexuality and more as early as you are able to,” Waters stated. “Universities need to maintain a victim-centered process.”UW-Madison requires all incoming students to do an online violence prevention training that takes about two hours, McGlone said. Waters iterated that universities need to ensure that every person that comes forward has access to as much support and information as they need.“We have already failed students the second they walk in the door by not providing this education earlier,” she concluded. Heidi and Edie, a UW sophomore and Kendall’s physics classmate, felt that UW-Madison should have at the very least notified students in close proximity to Kendall so that they could have adequately prepared themselves. “Women and people in general should be made aware when [they’re] going to be in a discussion or lecture [with him] or in a dorm, especially [on the same] floors,” Edie said. “That is so sketchy and I would feel so unsafe [not knowing].” “I would hope that they wouldn’t even let him [on campus] in the first place, but if they were going to do that, yes, I would want to know,” stated Heidi. “But also I would just feel continuously unsafe. It’s like no one wins, obviously except for him.”However, Grace, Peyton, Heidi and Edie all feel that the University’s ultimate decision to admit Kendall was questionable at best.“I don’t think he should have been allowed on the UW campus. I think as soon as UW realized that he was a threat, he should’ve had his admission revoked. He chose to assault these women, and now he has to live with those consequences,” said Grace. “I think UW has a responsibility to its currently admitted students who are already paying tuition to not allow a convicted sexual predator onto campus.” Kendall’s classmates are not the only ones concerned for the safety of women on campus. Cora, a sophomore at UW-Madison and Kendall’s teammate on UW-Madison’s water skiing team, shared that typically, waterski teams are not shy about changing in and out of swimsuits in front of one another. She found it strange when she was asked to step behind a car to undress. Later, she learned of Kendall’s convictions from her teammates. “He should be telling people on the team what's going on. When people are changing and girls are changing, he should have a spot he has to go to. [We need] more restrictions like that because not only is it our team [at risk], [but] we're talking about Lacrosse, Marquette, Iowa State, Illinois schools, Minnesota schools,” said Cora. “[Kendall is] putting other girls at risk too.”McGlone explained that UW-Madison posts information about convicted sex offenders on the UW-Madison Police Department Website, as per the federal Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act. However, the criteria to define someone as a sex offender does not include surveillance without consent, meaning Kendall is not on this list. “When this type of information comes to our attention, staff from the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards typically meet with the student involved to discuss expectations under campus policy,” McGlone stated. “While we cannot take disciplinary action against someone for behavior that occurred while they were not enrolled at UW-Madison, we can and do hold students accountable for any violations of the law and university policy while they are enrolled.”According to Cora, the front and back cameras are cracked on Kendall’s phone, rendering them useless. Kendall told her that UW-Madison allegedly broke the cameras to deter him from reoffending and that he expressed having no intentions of recording anyone else undressing. ""The university does not break students’ phones as a response to misconduct,"" McGlone responded. The women familiar with Kendall’s case feel that the University’s response and lack of direct action speaks volumes about UW-Madison’s true priorities, especially when it comes to balancing student safety with tuition dollars. “It seems like a slap in the face for women that it doesn’t really matter [to the university]. Even when somebody has all of these [legal] things against him, they’re still like not taking action to make women aware and safe,” Edie explained. “Basically what it says is ‘sucks to be you’ when they decide to let someone in who they know has the potential to cause harm to other students,” Grace echoed. “What they’re saying to all of those students who are now potential victims for this predator is ‘thanks for your money, every man for themselves.’”UW Housing declined to provide specific comments on the situation and deferred to University Communications. Dr. Jennifer Sheridan, the interim Associate Dean for Inclusion, Equity and Diversity in Engineering also felt that a university-provided response would speak best for her department.McGlone responded with encouragement for students with questions to contact available resources that specialize in sexual misconduct, such as UHS Survivor Services (a confidential resource); the Title IX Program; the Dean of Students Office. “It’s understandable that a survivor would have questions about this situation. We recognize students may not be aware of our admissions policies or of all the ways UW–Madison works to prevent sexual assault and misconduct, protect and support students and hold perpetrators accountable,” said McGlone. “We’ll work with you to provide resources and protective measures to meet your specific needs; we’re here to support you throughout your time on campus.”Peyton reflected on Kendall’s actions, CHS’s inactions and her experience so far at UW-Madison as all having impacted her not only a student, but as a feminist, a survivor and a human being. “The amount of pain [I felt], it actually did affect me. The way I view the world is so much different, and especially the school, knowing that they let in that person. It’s hard to come here and be so positive about coming here,” she said. “I love Madison, [but] are they really working as hard as they should be?”Kendall declined requests for comment.

Led by the Wisconsin Department of Justice, Kaul says the plan has support from survivor groups, crime victim services professionals and district attorneys.  “The people of Wisconsin, and especially victims, deserve an independent review of clergy and faith leader abuse,” Kaul said in a statement. “With this initiative, we are seeking to ensure that survivors of clergy and faith leader abuse have access to needed victim services, to help prevent future cases of sexual assault and to get accountability to the extent possible.”Reports of abuse will be investigated no matter when it is alleged to have occurred, according to the statement. The Department of Justice reported that it is looking into “the five Catholic dioceses in Wisconsin, as well as several religious orders with priests in Wisconsin.” The form for victims includes an option for Catholic churches, or an option to type in which denomination from which the abuse was experienced.Survivors, those who are aware of or witnessed sexual abuse and people who have knowledge about the cover-up of such abuse, are all being encouraged to give confidential statements to the Department of Justice. Those with information pertaining to the initiative are encouraged to report online at supportsurvivors.widoj.gov/ or by calling 1-877-222-2620.Too much, or too little?The Archdiocese of Milwaukee released a statement shortly after Kaul announced the initiative, saying they have concerns the investigation will “re-victimize” survivors.“There is no evidence to suggest that the Church as a whole and the Archdiocese of Milwaukee hasn’t already taken all possible steps in addressing issues surrounding clergy sexual abuse,” the church said in the statement. “We also question why only the Catholic church is being singled out for this type of review when sexual abuse is a societal issue.” The release goes on to say that the Catholic church has “done more to combat sexual abuse over the last 20 years than any other institution in the United States.”While the DOJ has been in contact with five Catholic dioceses and multiple religious orders with priests about the review, Nate’s Mission, a project aiming to end clergy abuse, says they aren’t satisfied with the lack of vocal support.“Wisconsin dioceses and religious orders have repeatedly attempted to assure survivors that they take this issue ‘seriously’ and have implemented ‘measures’ to ensure the prevention of child sexual abuse,” the group said in a statement. “After decades of gag orders, lies, hush money payouts to abusive priests, survivors have learned not to trust church officials.” They say that if the dioceses and religious orders are confident that they have not committed crimes, then they should be eager to comply with the investigation.Kaul said in a press conference Monday that the investigation is ongoing and the the Department of Justice would continue to be in contact with faith leaders across the state.",Wisconsin Department of Justice to investigate church-related sexual abuse,UWM

Denim Day 2021 will begin at 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday at Library Mall to support victims of sexual violence. Participants will march down Langdon Street to the Capitol, where survivors will gather to share their experiences. Participants are encouraged to wear denim and required to wear face masks and socially distance. The march is in protest of sexual violence across the United States as well as on the UW-Madison campus, and is a part of PAVE’s programming for Sexual Assault Awareness Month. “Our goal is to bring awareness to the public health crisis that sexual violence is on our campus,” said PAVE-UW Chair Eli Tsarovsky. Denim Day will not just empower survivors and allies, but the event will also show that there is a community that supports survivors and wants to bring about an end to sexual violence on the UW-Madison campus, said Tsarovsky. “We need to bring more accountability for perpetrators and support for survivors on campus,” said Tsarovsky, underscoring that more funding for Survivor Services as well as Mental Health Services within University Health Services is integral to helping aid student survivors. According to Tsarovsky, the university has not done enough to address the impact of gender-based violence in the campus community.“UW needs to do better,” emphasized Tsarovsky. In the PHA press release, Tsarovsky emphasized the importance of intersectionality in addressing sexual violence. “Ending sexual violence goes hand-in-hand with ending racism, sexism, ablesim, homophobia, state violence and other systems of oppression that out our groups in our community,” said Tsarovsky. “This march is a testament to the people of our community taking a firm stand against sexual violence.” Both the IFC and PHA’s involvement in Denim Day 2021 is intended to “show their community that the amount of sexual violencce [on-campus] is overwhelming” and highlight the importance of community in addressing sexual violence, according to Tsarovsky. “At the end of the day, this event is not about the organizations involved,” said Tsarovsky. “This event is survivor-centered and meant to empower and stand in solidarity with survivors in our community.”For those that cannot attend, campus organizers hope individuals will share resources across social media platforms. “We see you, hear you and believe you,” Tsarovsky said to survivors. “You will never walk alone.”","PAVE’s Denim Day 2021 seeks to support, empower survivors of sexual violence",UWM

The group hopes that by leading workshops and hosting events, they will educate and connect with a wide audience to start conversations about sexual assault, said PAVE chair Eli Tsarovsky.Having started under new leadership in the fall and worked without a full team until January, PAVE set lofty goals that have come fruition throughout April. “It’s like a dream,” Tsarovsky said. “We took an organization that had essentially zero people and have just made it something really exciting.”Throughout the month, PAVE has co-hosted and sponsored events with different groups across campus. On April 28, it will round out SAAM with a Denim Day march that is cosponsored by the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life. “I think the biggest thing that I want to come out of this is just building an environment on this campus that is just much more like empathetic and caring of each other, really seeing people's humanity,” Tsarovsky said. “We can have these hard conversations, and we can actually make change happen on campus.”PAVE has embraced the shift to online meetings this year, sourcing a variety of speakers and drawing much larger audiences than they have in the past.Chanel Miller, author of Know My Name: A Memoir about her experience as a survivor, spoke to students Monday via Zoom at an event that drew over 100 attendees. “Something we've noticed so far, is events have been really successful, educational, impactful, and that the people who stand to benefit from the most have actually been showing up finally,” said Alyssa Bokotey, a member of the PAVE peer education program. “Which is what we've been working towards.”Other PAVE members echoed Bokotey’s excitement about attendance and engagement for SAAM events thus far. Reaching a wider audience is something PAVE has struggled with in the past, Bokotey said.“To get to this place that we're at where we have so many events, and so many people are showing up and are willing to take part in the conversation, to me, indicates that there is broader change that's happening, (and) indicates to me that we are successful in our mission,” said PAVE Peer Education Coordinator Rachel Pomazal. Reaching wider audiences has been a trend for PAVE, which had to significantly restructure over the past academic year. Aside from greater and wider attendance, the group has seen social media engagement and hosted a number of workshops that have exceeded their expectations, Tsarovsky said. “This semester in general I think we've done a really good job of calling folks in instead of calling them out,” Pomazel said. “Populations who we may generally think of as someone who might be a perpetrator or might be part of a culture that is problematic.

Other victors include Patrick Heck, District 2, and Nikki Conklin, District 9. Bennett, a UW-Madison student and a cofounder of the BIPOC Coalition, became the first Black alder to represent District 8, which encompasses the UW campus and some surrounding neighborhoods. Bennett received 66.2% of the vote while challenger Ayomi Obuseh received 33.8%, according to Channel 3,000. Fewer than 500 votes were cast in the District 8 election, compared to 4,600 votes from the same seven wards in the 2020 general election, according to data from the Dane County Clerk’s office.In a press release, Bennett expressed her gratitude for the votes and support from the UW-Madison community. “I want to thank every single person who supported me over these past few months. Running a grassroots, virtual and student/staff has not been easy,” Bennett said. “Despite many obstacles we still put forward a bold, unapologetically progressive platform and have worked to build a coalition of civically engaged young people.”Bennett promised to use her position in local government to advocate for progressive policies that she feels will improve the lives of students as well as the broader Madison community.“This is just the beginning of our movement. We have a long way to go before we win affordable housing, sustainability and other important goals that we've set during this campaign,” Bennett said. “I know that with the support of the community, we will continue to make our voices heard.” Obuseh released a statement on Facebook Wednesday thanking her supporters and congratulating Bennett on her victory.“The support we’ve seen for our vision for Madison shows that change has arrived,” Obuseh stated. “I’m confident that this new cohort will bring the legislation we deserve as a community and want to congratulate my opponent on her big win.” Five days prior to the election, Obuseh denied claims made by an unnamed individual saying that they experienced sexual assault, which potentially placed her campaign in an unfavorable position. Obuseh told The Daily Cardinal her response was “reactionary.” “When I wrote those words, it was because I was deeply hurt by my own experiences,” Obuseh said. “I [felt] as though someone was doing something that wasn’t ok.” In District 2, which encompasses a large portion of Langdon St. and East Johnson, incumbent Patrick Heck received 61.8% of the vote, gaining his second term as alder and defeating local activist Benji Ramirez.  Heck stated that while in office, he will pursue progressive change while also maintaining what he feels to be the positive qualities of the Madison community.“I believe we can focus on racial inequities and social justice while maintaining the aspects of Madison that have made it a wonderful place to live for so many people,” Heck stated. “I will advocate for everyone in all District 2 neighborhoods while doing everything I can to make sure that as we emerge from the challenges of 2020 we don’t simply strive to go ‘back to normal.’”In District 9, longtime incumbent Alder Paul Skidmore was defeated by Nikki Conklin. Conklin won the seat against Skidmore, with 55.9% of the vote. Conklin released a statement on Facebook voicing her excitement for her upcoming term and thanking those who supported her campaign.“As your new elected Alder I will fight for quality affordable housing, equity and justice and safety for all among other things” Conklin said. “I want to thank everyone for all the support, love and encouragement they have shown me. Folks are ready for a change, and a vote for me, was a vote for change.In recent years, the council has moved further left politically, which left Skidmore as an outlier. His outspoken defense of the Madison Police Department isolated him from local activists and their allies pushing for reform and budget cuts within the department since last summer. Skidmore was also accused of calling a local activist a c*nt during a virtual council meeting last year. An investigation authorized by the city council into the incident was unable to definitively prove if Skidmore did say the slur.The results of the election insinuate that the incoming council will be the most diverse and progressive council yet, according to the Cap Times.Tuesday’s election also included a referendum regarding the salary given to city alders, the size of the common council, the length of alder terms and term limits in the common council. The questions came as a result of larger deliberations about if the common council should be structured with fewer representatives working full time to serve larger districts.Voters largely opposed making the position of alder a full-time profession and extending term lengths and instead supported implementing term limits and maintaining the current size of the council.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/regarding-ayomi-obusehs-harmful-comments,"April 2, 2021 | 12:30am CDT","  To the Editorial Board of the Daily Cardinal,I want to start by flagging this letter with a Trigger Warning(!) due to the discussion of sexual assault, a sensitive topic to many people.On Tuesday, March 31st, after District 8 Alder Candidate Juliana Bennett shared that she is a survivor of sexual assault on the Badger Votes Forum, hosted by Pod-Cast Your Vote on Facebook. The remarks from Bennett came after a question from an audience member about sexual assault on campus. The post’s caption described the purpose of the Podcast was to increase voter awareness and remind “all students of the power they hold to change the world.” Furthermore, the purpose of hosting the candidates was to learn “how these students are stepping up to be leaders in the city... and the power of the student voice.”As students on campus, we must realize the weight of our words and their impact on the community around us. Pod-Cast Your Vote is right― we can change the world with the power of the student voice. So when Ayomi Obuseh, a student leader and candidate for District 8 Alder― a district that predominantly encompasses campus residents― publicly denied a survivor’s claim to be a victim of sexual assault, it was incredibly disheartening. When she accused the survivor of doing it first to “gain empathy” and second for chicanery, it was hypocritical and spoke volumes about her own character.Survivors of sexual assault are frequently gaslit by their oppressors. Survivors of sexual assault are commonly silenced and judged by their communities. These pressures build up to suppress the voices of survivors from speaking up to tell their stories, to find the necessary resources, and to bring justice to their oppressors. Obuseh’s Facebook post was ambiguous enough for her to deny that this was directed at Bennett. However, it was posted shortly after the Forum, indicating that it was in response to the discussion. The news article published Wednesday afternoon by this paper included Obuseh’s response to the Bennett Campaign’s Press Release, which had included a quote from Bennett, saying, “I’m saddened and appalled by anyone… gaslighting my experiences as a survivor. Such rhetoric is extremely harmful.” To which Obuseh stated that “the post was made in reference to someone else”... “an individual she believed was falsely implying to have experienced domestic abuse.” This article then noted that Obuseh “apologized for the post and said that it was reactionary,” referring to the Facebook post which she had deleted.Obuseh’s post said that sexual assault is not something that we should “placate” and that Bennett’s response was “chicanery.” But for a student leader and Alder candidate with a platform and decently-sized following to say just that is hypocritical and deeply unsettling. Her “apology” was simply that she wasn’t directing the words towards her opponent. There was no apology for her accusations or reckless and irresponsible comments that discredited someone else’s story. Obuseh’s accusation is exactly how sentiments of gaslighting and erring on the side of skepticism are dominating social culture when survivors share their stories, especially when words like hers are general and nonspecific. If she had named someone explicitly and made her accusations more targeted, audiences could at least have had the context to which she was referring and would’ve supported her claim of chicanery. Absent of that, she is fueling the society that demands survivors stay quiet, a society that looks at survivors with suspicion rather than empathy. Social media is known for its negative qualities, particularly fueling hate. A public accusation invalidating a survivor is never okay, whether targeted and specific or general and inexplicit. This is precisely why there is a significant discrepancy between the number of sexual assault victims on campus (1 in 4 women) and the number of sexual assault instances reported (1 in 11 women). Why did Obuseh delete her post? Because she knew it was problematic― but that is not what she apologized for. The hypocrisy and blatant gaslighting are discouraging and saddening. Words coming from a student leader and Council candidate is even more unnerving and destructive. And it is isolating.The Cardinal should have included a trigger warning for the content. The Cardinal should pull their endorsement from Obuseh’s campaign. Most importantly, Obuseh should drop out of the race. This was not a gaffe or a momentary lapse in judgment. She didn’t apologize for the accusation, and the impact of her words has a more considerable consequence than she is willing to admit. Not knowing her post’s problematic nature and not recognizing it publicly is unbecoming of a candidate looking to represent Madison’s students and youth.UW-Madison student leaders should be better than this. We need to start creating an atmosphere that welcomes survivors’ stories and empathizes with the constant struggle of society silencing their voices. This is unacceptable, and I encourage my community and this newspaper to recognize that. We need to do more if we are ever to make the change that we audaciously claim that we can do.Sincerely,Kaitlin Kons, Taylor Scofield, Matthew Mitnick, Trevor Witz, Daniel Ledin, Djamal Lylecyrus, Lourdes Puig, Natalie Ierien, Elena Haasl, Nada Elmikashfi",Letter to the Editor: Regarding Ayomi Obuseh's harmful comments,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/the-minnesota-supreme-court-didnt-fail-unjust-laws-succeeded,"April 1, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","Content Warning: R*pe, Sexual AssaultThe Minnesota Supreme Court, through a unanimous decision, ruled that a man cannot be found guilty of rape solely because the woman had voluntarily gotten drunk before the assault. This third-degree criminal sexual conduct indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of policy that allows rape culture to persist in America.The rape laws that currently exist too often allow predators to evade criminal conviction due to minute technicalities.The Minnesota law, as it's written, states that the law only applies if the drugs or alcohol were administered against the victim’s will. This loophole — and many like it — continue to make it extremely challenging for sexual assault survivors to press charges against their rapists. The lack of accountability for rape cases is incredibly dangerous. Of the estimated rape incidents, just 31% of cases are reported to the authorities. It’s no wonder why this is the case, for only 5.7% of rapists are arrested and a gruesome 0.7% are convicted of felony rape.Rape cases go unreported, because the amount of trauma that a survivor is burdened with isn’t worth the extremely slim margins of a rapist getting charged. Pulling more statistics, many studies find that between 33% and 45% of survivors experience PTSD, and, further, 82% experience fear and anxiety. States immediately need to start updating and refining laws to protect survivors — not trivialize their experiences. As it stands, public reaction to rape accusations reinforces rape culture — especially accusations made against powerful politicians and celebrities.When Dr. Ford accused current Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, too many people painted her accusation as a smear campaign against an otherwise highly-regarded judge. Now,  he’s proven himself as below average, ruling against women’s reproductive rights and rights for undocumented individuals. Regardless of his performance on the bench, Kavanaugh should not be in the position he holds.Kavanaugh sympathizers gaslighted Dr. Ford’s (under-oath) testimony, in which she shared her experience of being held down against her will at a high school party by Kavanaugh. Those sympathizers echoed excuses along the lines of, “it was so long ago, he’s learned since then,” or claims that she had a vendetta against him because it wasn’t until now that she made the accusation. Perhaps the most recognized instance of gaslighting came from Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), when she — in a characteristic move of bipartisanship — believed that Dr. Ford was assaulted, however the assault was by someone other than Kavanaugh.When this is one of the most widely recognized instances of a rape trial in recent history, we present the message to survivors that it doesn’t matter how credible you are or how hard you try —  the legal system will not believe you and will not hold people accountable.It is fundamentally dangerous how little accountability rapists face in this country. Until we make laws that support survivors, rapists will continue to get away with their crimes and the institutions meant to preserve “justice” will stand on the wrong side of that scale.Riley Sumner is an Editor of the Opinion Desk.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/wisconsin-village-sees-surge-of-sexual-assault-survivors-come-forward,"April 1, 2021 | 1:00am CDT","Shorewood High School alumna Sophie Scherwenka posted a short video to her private Instagram account last week, but she didn’t do it to update her friends or show off an outfit or meal.Scherwenka’s goal was to expose the prevalence of sexual assault and intimate partner violence in Shorewood, Wis. Howell Raines of the New York Times said in 1979 that Shorewood was a ""maple-studded town on Lake Michigan [that] dotes on its reputation as Milwaukee's most liberal suburb."" Despite still being labeled a ""liberal haven,"" with its board of trustees investing millions in affordable housing, Shorewood has now seen dozens of women follow Scherwenka’s lead by sharing their own stories of abuse. Many of them have come out with stories involving former high school athletes and the children of influential families within the small community. Shorewood High School alumni point to fellow students, even friends, as the perpetrators. “I had been seeing posts going around on social media about how to prevent sexual assault and how men can make women feel safer, but it all seemed to apply to hookups and with strangers,” Scherwenka said about the video she posted, in which she referred to individuals that committed assaults by name. “We never discuss how to deal with sexual abuse from people we care about and are in some type of relationship with. We excuse behaviors done by loved ones that we would never excuse from a stranger.” The small Wisconsin village — with a population of 13,162 — has seen a serious pattern of abuse and sexual assault in recent years. In 2013, a maintenance technician at Shorewood High School was terminated after verbally assaulting a student. The official statement regarding Howard’s termination relied heavily on the student’s outfit.“She was wearing shorts and a sleeveless top, an outfit which was not particularly modest, but which would not have caused a ‘material interference’ with school activities,” the official report stated.The official statement places blame on the female student, stating that her outfit and demeanor encouraged the faculty member to make unwanted advances. Its official statement says that the student was more concerned with who the remarks were coming from, rather than the remarks themselves. The report also neglected to take into account the student’s actual words, feelings and expressions, and instead paraphrased her remarks.Other alumni have shared similar experiences, citing aspects of the community that serve as a barrier to consent. Sara Kostic reflected on the lack of education she and her peers received regarding consent and advocacy, which led to her experiencing sexual assault at a party when she was just 15.“He tried to put both his hands down the front of my pants, and I said no. His response to that was to instead put one hand down the back of my pants and one hand up my shirt,” she said. “I felt like I had already said no to something that made me even more uncomfortable, so I just didn’t really know how to say no to that. I thought maybe this is something I should be flattered by.”The student and two of his friends coerced Kostic into drinking and then turned off the lights when she became too inebriated to stand up. He pulled her into a chair and began kissing her, and she passed out shortly after. Kostic didn’t realize till years later, after she had begun attending Oberlin College, going to consent training and seeing a therapist, that what had happened to her was wrong. “There is definitely an interesting dynamic in part because of the size of the school and everyone knows everyone and then there are these people and these families that have more social capital or there are these athletes or popular friend groups and I feel like Shorewood prioritizes the wrong things,” Kostic stated. “Shorewood needs to prioritize consent.”Women are statistically more likely to be sexually assaulted by someone they already know. However, in a study conducted by the Journal of Women’s Health, researchers found that women in small and rural areas reported the highest prevalence of intimate partner violence than women living in urban areas, with 22.5% for women in smaller communities compared to 15.5% for urban women. Like Kostic, Shorewood High School alumna Nora Klein recounted her experience with sexual assault and intimate partner violence in the community, citing the lack of education around consent and sexual education as a main factor.“So often we think of abuse as something that is really black and white,” Klein stated. “And that's not true. It's really hard as survivors to even admit to yourself that what happened [was] abuse … it's a lot easier to deny it. Then when you have gaslighting on top of it, as well as manipulation by abusers, it makes it really hard to admit to yourself that that's what happened.”Klein also cited Scherwenka’s video as a motivating factor for her to come forward about her experience with intimate partner violence. While Klein was inspired to share her story after so many women had come before her, she also touched on how painful it can be to see so many women go through similar experiences.“I have had some really debilitating side effects of what I experienced: nightmares, flashbacks, physical pain, sleep issues, emotional reactivity, dissociation, depersonalization, some very intense physical and mental health effects,” Klein said. “I know how hard that's been for me and thinking about how many women experienced this and we have to just push through it is heartbreaking because it shows the pervasiveness of the problem.”The majority of interviewees for this piece recounted the lack of sexual education in the Shorewood School District as reasoning behind the miseducation of abusive patterns of many males within the community.A research paper published by WomenNC details that providing students with comprehensive sexual education including information about sexual consent leads to students being more informed about what constitutes sexual assault. In addition, they become less tolerant of sexual violence.On the other hand, consequences of a lack os sex education have been shown to include an increase in sexual violence, as well as sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies.Kostic echoed her own concerns about the lack of education at Shorewood High School.“I think that this school takes a very reductivist approach to consent and to sex in general,” Klein said. “I think sex education in general tries to simmer down what healthy relationships look like to something that is very simple. Relationships are formed by some of our earliest experiences and are formed by our relationships to our caregivers, to teachers, to our peers and our relationships to ourselves.”In accordance with the pattern of abuse at Shorewood High School, an additional faculty member was terminated in 2018 due to sexual assault accusations. Teacher Matt Jones was terminated for sexually assaulting students with both mental and physical disabilities along with three faculty members, one of whom has testified she was under the influence, according to an article by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.The Shorewood School Board sent an email to parents regarding the recent accusations, however, they did not respond to a request for comment. “We have learned about some social media activity occurring this past weekend in which former SHS graduates have posted testimonials regarding sexual assault, in some cases involving fellow former SHS graduates, and naming the individuals involved,” the email stated. “We are working to connect with and support our former students; however, we wanted you to be aware that this has occurred in case you hear or see your current students discussing these posts or expressing any new distress.” Klein reflected on the notion that Shorewood as a community still sees itself as “liberal,” which they believe to be  ‘good.’ Klein went on to suggest that Shorewood should take “a more holistic approach” when talking and teaching about consent, and could possibly create space for survivors “to tell their stories” of what interpersonal violence can look like and result in.“When we place value on things that are not to have value placed on them, we stop ourselves from seeing the reality. And I think that in order to work through oppression, and to work through harm and to work through trauma, we have to face the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it is,” she said.If you or someone you know is struggling with experiences with sexual assault or intimate partner violence, contact the national sexual assault hotline, located here.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/a-comprehensive-students-guide-to-april-6th-elections,"April 1, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","Madisonians will decide which local candidates will serve on the common council for a two year term during the April 6 elections.  Madison’s electoral process to decide the common council divides the city into twenty separate districts, with each district’s population voting on who they wish to represent their respective geographic area.  All alder’s term limits begin and end at the same time, meaning that technically there will be 20 total races, although only 12 seats are contested.  Two of these contested races will take place in districts 8 and 2, both of which are heavily populated by UW-Madison students. Read on to learn more about the individuals competing in these 2 districts and the platforms the candidates have chosen to run on. Find out the details of how to vote in the upcoming election on the city’s official website.District 8The district 8 race is taking place between Ayomi Obuseh and Juliana Bennett, both of whom are UW Madison student activists who took on leadership roles in racial equality protests following the murder of George Floyd.District 8, which encompasses the UW Madison campus, is populated predominantly by university students, a fact that has historically led its alder being a student and often a more outspoken proponent of progressive values than other council members.  The platforms of Obuseh and Bennett both are broadly reflective of the tradition of progressivism in district eight, with both advocating for issues such as police reform and racial equity.Obuseh, a Madison native, has been involved in local political organizing since attending Madison West highschool where she co-founded the advocacy group impact demand, which took an active role in the George Floyd protests this past summer.  Obuseh has stated that, if elected, she would primarily focus on issues related to racial equity by pursuing police reform and attempting to expand the amount/quality of public services offered to communities of color. “One of the issues I have always felt the most passionate about is racial equality. That means I am dedicated to solutions such as police accountability, food sustainability, jobs and transportation that would help to create healthier and more equitable communities,” Obuseh told the Cardinal in an interview.      Obuseh has been endorsed by organizations such as the local advocacy group Freedom, Inc., Blacks for Political and Social Action of Dane County and Our Wisconsin Revolution.  Bennett similarly has experience as a community organizer, being a co-founder of the UW-Madison BIPOC coalition which took part in the George Floyd protests and also demonstrated against the university’s SMART restart program this past fall.Bennett has run on a platform of racial inclusivity and has also emphasized her hope that she can act to more effectively implement policies advocated for by UW Madison students.""I really want to build a unified voice and a strong coalition of civically engaged young people that will be able to build a Madison that is truly diverse, welcoming, inclusive and a place that people can call home,"" said Bennett during a debate with Obuseh. “I  plan to bridge the gap between city and campus and not just be an advocate but also an instrument of change.”Bennett has received endorsements from several local figures including ASM chair Mathew Mitnick, former District 8 Alder Max Prestigacomo and former Wisconsin state senate candidate Nada ElmikashfiObuseh was recently accused of indirectly claiming that Bennett had lied about claiming to be a survivor of sexual assault which has caused some Obuseh’s supporters, including The Daily Cardinal, to rescind their support for the candidate.   District 2The alder race in district two, which encompasses a large portion of Langdon St. and East Johnson,  will be between one term-incumbent Patrick Heck and activist Benji Ramirez.Both candidates have campaigned on issues of police reform and public housing, however, the Ramirez campaign has placed a greater emphasis on pursuing more radical solutions to these problems.Ramirez, a 21-year-old Madison native, played a role as a community organizer during the George Floyd Protests this past fall, an experience they claim compelled them to run for public office.  Ramirez has focused his campaign around pursuing racial equity and making local politics more accessible to Black and Brown residents. “I made the decision to run because I know the current elected officials are missing large swaths of the communities' lived experiences,” Ramirez wrote in a Madison.com op-ed. “Only through the centering of the liberation of Black and Indigenous peoples will Madison be able to play our part in pivoting from global catastrophe.”Ramirez, who has received the endorsement of the Teacher’s Assistant Association (TAA), has stated that in office, they would pursue policies that would defund the Madison Police Department and reinvest in an assortment of community oriented programs, particularly public housing.  “Addressing social problems at their root by providing housing, education, access to healthy food, will do more to reduce burden on our city and public safety than hiring more police officers,” Ramirez told TAA representatives. “By reinvesting those monies into the wellbeing of the community: through education, economic relief, universal day-care, etc. we can begin to give every Madisonian a floor to stand on.”Heck, who works as a researcher at UW-Madison, has similarly promised to reform the Madison Police Department and reinvest in community programs. In contrast, the incumbent alder has advocated for a comparatively more measured tone than his opponent.“I strongly support the efforts to create alternate capacities that will relieve law enforcement’s need to respond to many calls for service,” Heck wrote on his campaign website. “That said, I do believe that MPD is a necessary agency in our current world, but the community needs to examine its over reliance on law enforcement.”Heck has also campaigned on the issue of public housing, pointing to his record as an alder who advocated that the city allocate additional funding towards public housing in 2020 and 2021. “I continue to participate in efforts to reduce homelessness, including keeping Housing First dollars in the city budget and supporting other affordable housing initiatives,” Heck stated. “I sponsored 2020 and 2021 budget amendments that added an additional $500,000 to the city’s Affordable Housing Fund each year.”Referendum questionIn addition to voting for city alders, Madison voters will also respond to four questions regarding the salary given to city alders, the size of the common council, the length of alder terms and term limits in the common council.These referendum questions come as part of a larger deliberation regarding whether the common council should be restructured so that there would be less alders, but representatives would work full time. Currently, the common council operates with twenty alders who earn a part time salary of roughly $13,700 per year. The referendum to make these changes to the common council is purely not binding, however, a significant show of support for the measure would likely cause the common council to more seriously consider restructuring.

On Feb. 25th, the Daily Cardinal Editorial Board endorsed Ayomi Obuseh for District 8 Alder in the Spring 2021 elections. However, after a Facebook post made by Obuseh on Tuesday evening, which insinuated a troubling portrayal of sexual assault survivors, we have decided to retract our original endorsement. At the Daily Cardinal, we stand with survivors of sexual assault; finding it critical that we — and others — do the same with our words and actions, we can no longer support Ayomi Obuseh. The statements made by Obuseh on the hastily-delivered social media post were discouraging, to say the least. Sexual violence remains an ongoing issue on our campus, as such, we no longer feel that she best represents the beliefs, values and interests of District 8 — a district representing the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s student body. We believe that it is important to have a candidate that will stand with all members of the Madison and campus community. No matter the circumstances, we believe it is imperative all individuals who come forward as survivors of sexual violence must be believed. Obuseh’s comments have made us question her ability to be a voice for those who need it most. Her rash actions have further casted doubt on her candidacy and ability to truly amplify the grievances of historically underrepresented and under-recognized community members. Though we regret to inform our readers of this decision, it is one we strongly believe is necessary.

In a now-deleted post, Obuseh denied claims made by an unnamed individual saying that they experienced sexual assault.“It’s appalling to hear someone claim to be ‘survivors’ of sexual abuse when they aren’t or using it to humanize themselves and gain empathy from others who don’t share those experiences,” Obuseh wrote. “If you don’t share that experience YOU ARE BLESSED.”According to Bennett, Obuseh’s now-deleted Facebook post was likely about her. Both candidates made guest appearances at a Badger Votes Forum Tuesday evening, where Bennett spoke on her own experiences with sexual assault and shared her plans to prevent sexual assault on campus.When asked about improving resources for sexual assault survivors by a viewer at the forum, Bennett responded that as a survivor, she felt compelled to make the campus a safer place.Obuseh made the Facebook post in question shortly after the event. “I’m saddened and appalled by anyone, let alone my opponent, gaslighting my experiences as a survivor. Such rhetoric is extremely harmful,” Bennett stated. “1 in 4 women at UW have experienced sexual assault, yet only 1 in 11 cases are reported. Most reports are truthful, but many don’t report for fear of not being believed. My fears were realized last night.”In a statement to The Daily Cardinal, Obuseh responded to Bennett’s statement, saying that the post was made in reference to someone else — an individual she believed was falsely implying to have experienced domestic abuse. As a survivor of sexual abuse herself, Obuseh apologized for the post and said that it was reactionary.“When I wrote those words, it was because I was deeply hurt by my own experiences,” Obuseh said. “I [felt] as though someone was doing something that wasn’t ok.

They also offer volunteer opportunities and host campus-wide events to educate and raise awareness. “It’s a movement against violence by students for students,” said PAVE Chair Elias Tsarovsky. “So we are able to relate to students in a way that is much different than like a [University Health Services] or a Title IX training because we are able to talk honestly about the current climate of campus.”During the spring 2021 semester, PAVE is launching media campaigns to increase awareness, looking at campus policy to aid in violence prevention, planning collaborations with the Greek organizations on campus, working with the UW-Madison Student Title IX Advisory Committee and hosting events for community members.“Knowing a lot of people who have been affected by these issues, this is something that needs to end now,” Tsarovsky said. “It's very much a motivator. I can make a difference doing this, and I know that my involvement in this will actually provide the people who want to make a difference the ability to make a difference.”Tsarovsky encourages UW-Madison students to get involved in PAVE through their volunteer leadership program, where students can contribute to projects that support PAVE, or as a peer educator, where students are trained to run PAVE’s General Workshop.  “I want every single person to be a part of this movement because there is a place for everybody to be a part of this,” Tsarovsky said.

In the film, Cassie would go to clubs and bars each week, pretending to be under the influence to see if men would come up to her and ask her if she needs a ride home. While in reality, she was completely sober and acting, every one of the “nice guys” that asked her if she needed a ride home always took her back to their apartment and took advantage of her. She never gives consent or says “yes” to their offers, because she is pretending to be very drunk, but she goes along with it to get to their houses. Right before the men succeed in the assault, she snaps out of her drunken character and tells them to stop. She frightens these men to make sure they never take advantage of another woman again. Throughout the movie, other characters would call Cassie “crazy” or “a psycho,” but I believe she was a realistic, modern hero. Even heroes like Wonder Woman and Batman kill to fight crime to protect innocent civilians. Cassie saves innocent women from being taken advantage of by men. Even though the film takes a dark turn with a murderous ending, I believe Cassie fighting back against cruelty makes her a hero. Cassie is in seek of revenge against Al Monroe (Chris Lowell), a man that raped her best friend Nina when they were in medical school together, causing her and Nina to drop out, who were in the top of their class, and eventually, Nina to take her own life. It is understood that the superheroes’ goals are to murder the villain in order to save the world. Cassie mimics this by trying to get revenge on Al Monroe, making her similar to a said fictional hero.The title of the film ""Promising Young Woman"" has more than just one meaning to me. It does indicate that even promising young women like students in medical school can experience sexual assaults, and it can alter the course of their lives. However, I believe it also means Cassie is making a promise to other young women, to try and stop the “nice guys” from assaulting innocent women. Revenge is a prevalent theme of this movie. Throughout the film, Cassie tried to get revenge on a woman from medical school who did not believe Nina, the dean of their medical school, Al Monroe’s lawyer and Al Monroe himself. Cassie got brunch with Madison (Alison Brie), the woman who disagreed with Nina’s rape allegations. Cassie hired a man to stage a fake assault, by putting her into a hotel bed, making her think she was raped. This seemingly malicious action was done so Madison would feel how Nina felt, without actually suffering through a real assault. She gave Madison a taste of the fear, violation and pain that comes with being taken advantage of. Dean Walker (Connie Britton) didn't even remember Nina’s story, due to the number of sexual assault and rape cases she claimed to get. She states how she always wanted to give the men accused “the benefit of the doubt.” Cassie teaches her a lesson by tricking Dean Walker’s daughter into giving Cassie her cell phone and telling Dean Walker that she is in the room where Nina was raped, making her fear that she would be raped, too. Al Monroe’s lawyer displayed his regret by crying to Cassie for bullying Nina to drop the case, so Cassie does not get revenge on him. He later helps catch Al for killing Cassie. Lastly, Cassie tries to stab Al Monroe to get back at him, but she ends up being murdered herself.The powerful subplot within this film involves Cassie’s love interest, Ryan Cooper (Bo Burnham). Coop goes to the coffee shop that Cassie works at and he confesses he had feelings for her when they went to medical school together. The audience starts to love Ryan and finds him to be a “nice guy” for Cassie. However, she later finds out his involvement in Nina’s sexual assault. Cassie saw a video of the assault, and Ryan was in the background of it. He was watching it occur, as a bystander. When she confronts him about it, she goes on a downward spiral. He says he was sorry but he “didn’t do anything.” However, witnessing something as severe as a sexual assault makes you partially at fault for not helping. The film’s overarching message about sexual assault allegations is clear. People in society, even other women, often choose to believe the man. This allows men like Al to walk away with clean hands more often than we might think. In this case, Al still graduates from medical school, and even gets engaged. While Cassie was hungry for justice for Nina, Al does not get caught for any of the crimes he commits. Cassie plays the role of a misunderstood hero in this film, as she tries to protect young women everywhere from frightening men willing to take advantage of them. Although she does end up being murdered by Al Monroe, the ending takes a huge twist. She succeeds in getting revenge on those involved in the rape of her best friend, by having the police lock up Al Monroe and Joe. However, Cassie is subsequently murdered. While the audience is initially stunned by her death, she still manages to successfully get justice for herself, and Nina.",'Promising Young Woman's' Cassie Thomas is a misunderstood hero,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/02/vote-ayomi-obuseh-for-district8-alder,"February 25, 2021 | 2:00am CST","Editor’s Note: On March 31, 2021, the Daily Cardinal retracted this endorsement of Ayomi Obuseh for District 8 Alder following the candidate’s discouraging comments on sexual assault. Read the full statement here.The whirlwind of national politics continues to take us by storm. In the midst of ongoing national crises — public health to racial reckoning to environmental degradation to the very livelihood of our democracy — local politics breathes in some fresh air of hope and trust in those who seek to represent us. The race for District 8 alder on the Madison Common Council, a position that largely represents the University of Wisconsin campus and nearby neighborhoods, has long been held by a UW student. A representative who speaks up on campus safety and environmental justice in our communities and neighborhoods, while bringing in a unique and often overlooked perspective to policy making.Ayomi Obuseh and Juliana Bennett — the candidates who aim to replace the seat currently held by Max Prestigiacomo — are clear indications of young civic leaders who are fighting for equity, sustainability and progressive policies. In their conversations with the Editorial Board, both candidates spoke extensively and passionately about their vision for Madison, a vision of affordable housing and public safety in the form of community control. However, there is only one candidate that can both represent students and the heart of Madison as a community — only one candidate to implement change on day one. Because of her experience advocating and working alongside fellow Madison residents and organizations, her diplomatic approach to city government and her knowledge on issues that most affect students and Madison-at-large, The Daily Cardinal Editorial Board is proudly endorsing Ayomi Obuseh for District 8 Alder. For years, Ayomi has been an advocate of much needed change. She led the fight for teacher diversity at Madison West High School, co-founded Impact Demand — a youth-led activist group — and marched on Washington D.C. Clearly, Ayomi has been an active member of the Madison community pursuing justice and equity for all who call this city home.  However, it is not just her activism that sets Ayomi apart. On her first day in office, Ayomi is prepared to come in with legislation. Through the skills she developed as an intern for the City Council and State Senate, Ayomi is ready and familiar with the people and processes it takes to implement a wide variety of realistic policy changes. For example, her affordable housing plans are centered around BIPOC communities building wealth. She plans to expand micro-lending programs for BIPOC nonprofits, work with ASM to connect students to housing resources, and produce creative projects like tiny homes. Essentially as an “economic justice project,” Ayomi sees housing as a necessary step in pursuing equity. Beyond housing, she even has legislation that includes turning algae blooms into sustainable energy and introducing live streams to increase student accessibility to local government. Ayomi also supports divesting from police and investing in communities. “It’s about public safety … it’s [about] resources and where to allocate resources,” she said to us. From continuing the civilian oversight board to redirecting resources towards a teen center, tenant protections and mental health programs, Ayomi is prepared to reimagine public and campus safety.Perhaps most importantly, Ayomi also recognizes that to accomplish all these necessary goals, she must build coalitions and connect with people both inside and outside of politics. She understands how the divisiveness of today’s political arena is not one that is sustainable, and strives to communicate with clarity and openness to drive her agenda forward.In her final statement, Ayomi emphasized how she was “tired of waiting,” and is ready to “get things moving.” She stressed that Madison “is her home” and that she is “excited to use [her] voice to amplify communities.”Ultimately, Ayomi’s intersecting policy platforms that focus on equity and justice, along with her understanding of legislation and diplomatic approach to achieving these goals, are what drive the Cardinal Editorial Board to believe she is the best candidate to be District 8 alder.  Ayomi is tired of waiting for change to happen in city government, and tired of the historical injustices toward BIPOC communities. Are you? The Daily Cardinal Editorial Board strongly urges all campus community members to vote Ayomi Obuseh for Alder on April 6 — in her words, it’s “time to elect someone who is moving with passion and a plan.” To learn more about Ayomi’s platforms and campaign, visit ayomi4alder.vote.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/02/cephus-files-against-wisconsin-madison-for-multiple-violations,"February 24, 2021 | 9:00am CST","Former Wisconsin wide receiver Quintez Cephus is suing the university for violating due process rights, Title IX provisions and breach of contract, the current Detroit Lion said in a lawsuit filed Tuesday afternoon.Cephus, who is seeking unspecified damages for the accused violations, was arrested on second and third-degree sexual assault charges in Aug. 2018 following a sexual encounter with two 18-year-old UW students in his apartment earlier that April. The university administered a Title IX investigation of the incident, suspending Cephus from the Wisconsin football team and expelling him from UW for violating the school’s nonacademic misconduct code.Cephus was acquitted by jury of all charges on Aug. 2, 2019 after a deliberation of just 45 minutes, and was reinstated to Wisconsin football shortly after. Cephus’ lawyer, Andrew Miltenberg, told the Associated Press that the Title IX investigation’s conclusions were “an egregious miscarriage of justice.”“[Cephus] wants to set a precedent so that schools are more careful and more diligent in how they proceed on these cases and not just sort of rushing ahead to judgment when they know for a fact they don’t have all the evidence,” Miltenberg said.Within the complaint, Miltenberg claims that UW-Madison used Cephus as a “scapegoat” to make up the school’s prior negligence surrounding sexual assault.“[UW-Madison was] seeking to push for harsh male prosecutions in order to remedy its long-standing failure to address sexual assault complaints,” the complaint reads. “[Cephus was] the perfect candidate for the university to prove its investigative efforts and punish accused males in a high-profile way.”For Cephus, his return to football for the 2019 season was a sweeping success. He led the Badgers that fall with 59 receptions for 901 yards and seven touchdowns, including crucial scores against No. 11 Michigan and No. 8 Minnesota to lead Wisconsin to victory.""I think that was the moment where I realized what God has in store for me,"" Cephus said back in Sept. 2019 after a huge performance against Central Michigan in which he hauled in 130 yards and two touchdowns. ""He has brought me to this point. To have a little success was a big thing for me.""I’ve worked hard to get back here. Just very thankful for the plans that God has had for me. I’m just living as his son and trusting everything that he has coming forward.""Cephus’ strong return earned him a fifth-round selection (166 overall) in the 2020 NFL Draft. The wide receiver played in 13 games this past fall due to injuries within Detroit’s wide-receiver room, totaling 20 receptions and two touchdowns.Miltenberg told the Associated Press that NFL agents and analysts believe Cephus’ expulsion cost him multiple spots in the draft. “While we are reviewing the complaint filed by Mr. Cephus, we’re confident UW-Madison followed appropriate processes in this matter,” university spokesman John Lucas responded in a statement released Tuesday afternoon.",Cephus files against Wisconsin-Madison for multiple violations,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/02/why-isnt-lakeshore-path-lit,"February 18, 2021 | 2:00am CST","Walking the Lakeshore Path after nightfall is not for the faint of heart. Not only does the trail suffer from non-existent lighting, aside from the streaks of moonlight through the trees, but it lacks access points for police or escape routes for walkers. This renders the path unusable at night — except for those walking in groups, keys clenched between their knuckles with their phones out and ready to call 911. “I have had to walk the path past dark many times,” said Katie Zewiske, a UW-Madison student and former Lakeshore resident. “I try not to be by myself, but if I am, I definitely have the flashlight on my phone on and I usually call a friend or a family member to talk to.”Will Rhodes, another former resident of the Lakeshore neighborhood, echoed this feeling of unease. “I told myself I was paranoid and kept walking,” he said. “That’s a privilege I have as a male student though, because while I think about ghosts and movie monsters hiding behind the trees, there are other students who have to deal with much more real safety concerns.”These safety concerns have never been resolved.Three candidates for the District 8 alder seat have proposed lighting the Lakeshore Path in just the past three years. The measure, while widely supported among students that live in the dorms along Mendota, has never come to fruition despite petitions, op-eds and complaints. In 2016, following a string of sexual assaults, students even protested on campus for better lighting along the path. Ald. Max Prestigiacomo approached administration at the beginning of his term in 2020 to discuss additional lighting with no success. In the end, only two of UW-Madison’s 140 blue emergency phone lights dot the trail’s four-mile span. “Rapeshore Path” remains dark.The University of Wisconsin Police Department has long opposed adding additional safety precautions to the trail. After a 2019 petition gathered over 1,000 signatures to advocate for additional blue light phones, UWPD responded, calling the emergency phones outdated and costly. The fact is, the university police benefits from the path remaining unlit. While the Lakeshore Path is generally safe, the darkened nature of the trail can discourage students from walking it at night. According to UWPD spokesman Marc Lovicott, this helps prevent possible incidents from occurring in a place without an escape route for troubled pedestrians or access point for officers. Lovicott recommended that students use this secluded path less, noting that there are “other routes on campus that are safer for our community.”The department promotes this message, which may seem contradictory: “Stay in lit places,” but there will be no lighting on the Lakeshore Path, one of the quickest ways for students to get from Memorial Union and College Library to their housing in Lakeshore. “Their message to survivors is that you and your experience are not as important as the university's desires,” Juliana Bennett said. Bennett, UW BIPOC co-founder and Dis. 8 alder candidate, doesn’t buy into the UWPD’s argument that lighting the path is unnecessary. Instead, she holds that lighting the path is worth the effort if students feel safer for it. “I was talking to a district resident the other day, and she said, ‘I live on Lakeshore and I'm tired of feeling scared to walk home at night. I'm just tired of clutching my keys and having to decide if I'm going to go to a club meeting, or if I'm going to stay home to feel safe,’” Bennett stated. “We need to work within our city to light the Lakeshore path and meet those basic needs so that people feel safe, welcomed and included.”In 2015, UW-Madison reported that 27.6% of female undergraduates have experienced sexual assault, slightly above the national average of about 25%. However, exact data on the number of incidents along the four-mile path are murky, as many sexual assaults may go unreported. The few documented incidents along the path paint a bleak picture. In February 2017, a man was detained near Lakeshore path after grabbing and physically attacking pedestrians. In September 2016, Brian Campbell was arrested after choking a woman on Lakeshore near Memorial Union. Both occurrences took place past sunset. So, the big question remains: Why isn’t the path lit? “I don't think funding is an issue,” ASM Chair Matthew Mitnick said. “I think it's partly the precedent of not lighting it, laziness and then the UWPD intervening, so [that] they can maintain their control of the area.” Mitnick, now a member of the city’s Public Safety Review Committee, ran for the Dis. 8 alder seat in 2019 on a platform centered around student issues including public safety, advocating for additional lighting on the Lakeshore path and emergency phones. While his campaign was unsuccessful, Mitnick is sure that lighting Lakeshore isn’t an impossible task. According to Mitnick, if an alder were to introduce legislation to light the path, the Common Council would likely refer it to the Joint Campus Area Committee, which can either pass the legislation or make necessary amendments. The committee would then send a recommendation to the Common Council to adopt, and the council could vote to adopt it with the aim of forcing the University’s hand. “I think that's the best way you can do it — at the city level,” Mitnick determined. But as history has shown, even with political pressure, lighting the Lakeshore path may be more difficult than it seems. “We have electricity, we have lights. We can even put up poles!” former Dis. 8 Ald. Scott Resnick exclaimed. “But for a myriad of reasons, it doesn’t get done.”Resnick represented campus and the Spring St. neighborhood from 2011 to 2015, and he dealt with the same problems student representatives face today in his struggle to light the trail. He worked Director of Planning & Landscape Architecture and the Lakeshore Nature Preserve, Gary Brown, to develop a plan to light the path. But between environmental and geographic concerns, the proposal never came to fruition.“This is indeed a perennial topic but I wouldn’t say it has been controversial in any way,” Brown said. “This comment comes up every couple of years, especially from our newer student leaders on campus.”Brown has now dealt with generations of student representatives seeking to light the Lakeshore Path, and the issue has remained the same. More physical space exits to the west of the path, allowing for some lighting that is already installed. To the east, any development would be restricted by the steeply sloped wooded areas on one side of the trail and the Lake Mendota shoreline on the other. Installing lights there, Brown stated, is not possible.“When I talk to new students, ASM leaders and alders about lighting the Howard Temin Lakeshore Path and the reasons for not lighting the path, they more fully understand that this complicated issue is not easily solved by just adding lights to a pathway,” Brown reflected.Through a partnership with Sustainable Madison, Bennet still hopes to implement environmentally-friendly, motion sensor LED outdoor lighting along the Lakeshore path. Mitnick concurred with this plan, noting that motion-activated lights would limit the negative impacts of light on the Lakeshore ecosystem and subsequently reduce the energy costs associated with lighting the lengthy trail. Brown spoke on Bennet’s plan, stating that it was “interesting” but potentially problematic, as it could be triggered off and on all night long, disrupting the bats, owls and other wildlife that live along the path. Lighting the Lakeshore path would also promote the utilization of the trail, conflicting with the university and UWPD’s preference to deter nighttime use of the path and potentially causing a false sense of security among pedestrians.He holds that students should continue keeping to lit paths, or the ""LightWay,"" that are also supported at night by the campus bus, SAFE Nighttime services and UWPD patrols.Regardless of university pushback, Bennett plans to first introduce a resolution from Common Council encouraging UW-Madison to light the path. She also intends to co-sponsor any legislation that ASM puts forward to accomplish the task. “Down by Memorial Union, that used to be the most unsafe place on campus,” Bennett pointed out. “A past Dis. 8 alder decided to put lighting around the Memorial Union area, and now it's one of the safest places on campus.”Bennett believes that now is time to finally light dangerous areas on and off campus, especially the Lakeshore path, to ensure that all students feel safer. It’s a crucial part of an array of public safety initiatives that she promises to put forward if elected.“If not now, then when? If not us, then who? The time is now. It's long overdue,” she concluded.",Why isn’t Lakeshore Path lit?,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/02/what-marilyn-manson-really-represents,"February 7, 2021 | 1:40pm CST","On Feb. 1, Evan Rachel Wood came out publicly, stating that she had been in an abusive relationship with Brian Warner, known to most as Marilyn Manson, a “goth-shock” icon in the expansive genre of punk-rock. Wood states via her Instagram that Manson had groomed her for years and she was “brainwashed and manipulated into submission.” In 2018, Woods had testified in front of the Senate about her experience as a survivor of domestic violence. She was a part of a bigger effort to get the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act implemented in all 50 states. At the time, Woods did not name her abuser but speculation arose and many thought Manson could have fit the bill. In the years that followed their relationship, which ended in 2010, Manson was cited alluding to certain damaging behaviors. “I have fantasies every day about smashing her skull in with a sledgehammer,” Manson was quoted saying in an interview with Spin. Woods is one of a few women to come forward and name Manson as their abuser. His ex-wife Dita Von Teese shared a post on instagram, stating that her own experience with Manson did not mirror that shared by other women. She did, however, offer support. Sarah McNeilly, Charlyne Yi and Ashley Lindsay Morgan are among the other women that accused Manson of misconduct. Phoebe Bridgers also tweeted out her own experience that she had at Manson’s house when she was a teenager. Bridgers shares that Manson referred to a room in his house as a “r*pe room.” She also shared that Manson’s team knew of this behavior back then. Since the allegation, Manson has been dropped by his label and his booking agent and has already tried to deny the allegations with a statement that claims his relationships were “entirely consensual.” Nine-inch-nails frontman Trent Reznor has spoken out against Manson following the allegations. He has also addressed, what he calls, a “fabrication” of a story that Manson included in his auto-biography. Reznor had also publicly denounced his relationship with Manson in 2009, suggesting he had a series of concerning behaviors and was self-absorbed. In 2017, Manson suggested the two had moved forward in their friendship, a claim that Reznzor has never backed. The discourse surrounding Reznor and Manson speaks to another issue. The ways in which people tend to let certain genre icons off the hook due to obscure makeup or strong messages against the status quo. No one could ever put their finger on what it is Manson actually stood for. Was his face paint and sometimes hard-to-look at face jewelry all a facade? Or did he genuinely believe in what he’s created to be his image? Not to mention, Woods started dating Manson when she was just 19 and he was 36. You would think this behavior, which is one that takes advantage of the vulnerability of young women and morphs it into unwarranted desire, would’ve caught the eye of the music industry? Or if this wasn’t enough, maybe his blatant, very clear misogyny would have, or the fact that in an interview, Manson admits to calling Woods 158 times a day at one point would have been the final, red flag. But, no. Manson always seemed provocative, it was a part of who he was. And maybe since he wasn’t so mainstream, no one really cared about cancelling him online or dragging his name through Twitter. But, there’s the problem. In the music industry as a whole, these predatory behaviors go unseen, or actually, ignored. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, we saw Ryan Adams exploited for his repetitive, abusive behavior against women in his past. Some of us sat through the “Surviving R. Kelly,” a Lifetime documentary that detailed the sexual abuse allegations against the rapper. But even in the aforementioned cases, it takes a village for society to strongly switch sides. One allegation is never enough, a bad experience years ago falls second in the minds of industry insiders because whatever sells sells. And this happens outside of the music industry, too. It’s a Hollywood problem, a Wall Street one. Any sort of power imbalance gives fuel to predatory behavior and a small, subtle slap on the wrist becomes the norm. The final point here is that toxic masculinity can shapeshift. Abusive and predatory behavior does not only fit one bill, it can hide behind layers of shock or it can be swept under the rug in the case of an outcast. For someone like Manson, his hellish, provocative image has made it hard for people to really care, to ring out his wrongdoings in public. Despite mounting evidence throughout his career that his attitudes and on-stage persona could leak into his personal life, he’s still managed to keep going. In a piece for “The New Yorker,” Amanda Petrusich dives deeply into how the nature of sexual violence has always been central to who Manson really was. She writes about how it’s easy when you’re younger to not fully indulge in the reality that these musicians could really represent the darkness of their music. She represents a really strong call to action here. We’re no longer in the age where we can wholeheartedly back celebrities because of their catchy lyrics or engaging online presence. We have to hold people accountable and take things and people for what they really are. Someone like Marilyn Manson has been let off the hook more times than necessary and it’s our job to make sure the next predatory, abusive counterculture figure doesn’t get so far.",What Marilyn Manson really represents,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/01/four-years-of-trump,"January 28, 2021 | 2:00am CST","The last four years have inflicted carnage on American democracy. The Trump administration’s shattering of presidential norms, attacks on the free press and insistence on unwavering loyalty has ultimately led us to what has been dubbed the most divisive era in American history.In the days leading up to the 2016 Election Day a Washington Post columnist published a piece titled: “Calm down. We’ll be fine no matter who wins.” Oh boy.As Trump began to shift from what many perceived to be a publicity stunt to one of the most autocratic leaders America has seen, we’ve become desensitized to the numerous scandals plaguing the government and our reputation abroad. News story after news story depicting the outrageousness of Trump’s actions, each one more ridiculous than the last, lead to more and more people becoming disenfranchised with politics.Many were shocked by the attempted siege on the capitol amidst the certifying of the electoral college votes on Jan. 6 — including capitol police and other officials who failed to prevent rioters from breaching the capitol building. But can we really be shocked? Nearly every rally, every speech and every policy put forward by the Trump administration has been carefully curated to the climax of the internet-dubbed “guy in a chewbacca bikini” leading an invasion of the U.S. Capitol.So let’s take a look into the origin of the Trump presidency, and what led to its violent conclusion. What things did we miss — or simply ignore — that caused the near-fall of American democracy as we know it?The Era Before TrumpismDespite what many perceived as Trump randomly joining the group of presidential hopefuls, Trump had tossed around and even ran for the nomination multiple times before his 2016 bid. He first floated the idea around in 1988 to run as a Republican, however his first campaign was in 2000 when he eventually dropped out from seeking the Reform Party nomination.While Trump had been involved in the political landscape during the 2000s, President Obama’s campaign for a second term seemed to be when Trump gained attention. In 2012, Trump didn’t invent — but instead amplified false and racist claims that questioned the validity of Obama’s birth certificate, falsely claiming Obama was born in Kenya when in reality he was born in Hawaii.This claim was perhaps the first to gain media attention and sparked the McCarthy-esque playbook that would eventually become one of the leading strategies of Trump’s relationship with the media. In a phone appearance on CNBC in 2012, Trump suggested, “A lot of people are questioning his birth certificate … They’re questioning the authenticity of his birth certificate.”Linguistically, Trump offers a vague idea to his audience that “a lot of people” or “many people” hold a belief. He never quantifies how many “a lot” is, and it took media outlets a long time to figure out how to cover these fictitious Trump claims. His falsehoods instill doubt in our institutions, ultimately causing further than distrust.As evidenced by his false claim against Obama, Trump positions the media in an impossible situation because of the media's insistence on objectivity. If the media says Trump is lying, they remove themselves as a passive voice that shares what happened, and instead play an active role in deciding our reality. If the media just says there is a “controversy” surrounding the claim then they make it seem like both stances are equally valid, even though that is not the case.Trump systematically manipulated the media by throwing out ridiculous assertions and forced the media to make a decision. When the media decided to start calling out Trump’s false claims, he then claimed the media was out to attack him. At this point, Trump had convinced a significant chunk of the population to believe in his false claims. Then, when the media identified his tactics, Trump mobilized his followers to defend him against what they now believe is a war against the media.We as writers want to be careful with how we portray Trump compared to other historical leaders, however it is important to analyze some key similarities between him and populist figures.In the years leading up to WWII, American media covered Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler as “objective journalists.” John Brioch, a professor at Case Western Reserve University argues that Mussolini was a “darling of the American press,” as many articles skewed neutral or positive in tone.Eventually, the press referred to Hitler as “the German Mussolini,” which in itself suggested the same positive connotations of Hitler that Mussolini had already garnered. Brioch argues that the press had portrayed Hitler as a “nonsensical screecher of wild words.” American press believed that eventually Hitler would start to behave like normal German politicians, and his campaign was simply a way to mobilize voters.This is eerily familiar to the early days of Trump’s campaign. The media did not take him seriously as a candidate, and continually had expectations that Trump would be “more presidential” even though seemingly every day he committed another outrageous act of unprofessional behavior. Ripe for the Picking Unlike his failed bid prior to 2016, however, Donald Trump developed a new style when confronting the public. The previous bid in 2000 was largely forgotten in the public eye in favor of his TV persona in the Apprentice and for his displays of vast wealth. Much like many of the great orators of the past, Trump had a legitimate talent — whether it may be malevolent or not is beside the point — to tap into a reservoir of deep-seated resentment and malcontent with the general population. He recognized a common grievance among the working class of America and used that to his endless advantage.In recent decades, the stereotype of the corrupt politician benefiting off of the public’s struggle has pierced the mind of millions of Americans. After disasters such as the Great Recession and ensuing political debacles, a significant portion of the American public became fed up with the traditional ways of politics and began to search for alternatives.This was the beginning of the sort of environment in which a personality such as Donald Trump could thrive. An atmosphere filled with partisanship and a longing for an “everyman” to be at the helm helped propel Trump to become an unlikely candidate in 2016. However, as he thrived in such an atmosphere, he had to foster it in a similar manner as to prolong his time in power. In playing up the political division to benefit his brazen style of politics, he further widened the gap between ordinary Americans when it came to politics. He fed off of partisan hatred, and sought to make an enemy out of anyone who did not support his bid.During both the Primary and Presidential debates of 2015 and 2016, Trump embraced a style of debating that was unlike any of his peers. It was essentially devoid of legitimate debate tactics and favored name calling and interruptions instead. To the disillusioned of the public, this was a breath of fresh air and reminded them more of an ‘Average Joe’ than a career politician. After the success of such a strategy during the Primary Debates, Trump adopted it full-time and it became his signature style of brutish mockery over intelligent reproof. He revelled in this modern myth which painted him as a self-made man and as a product of a can-do attitude and of the wonders of capitalism. No matter how far it was from the truth, it certainly played to this new base which seemingly went beyond the lines of red or blue. Like it or not, it was a movement sweeping lower and middle class America on a platform which touted malformed ideas one might find in a locker room, to borrow his infamous cop out.He captivated the disillusioned of the American people with appeals that seemed to speak to the very heart of their objections. Many at the time predicted, based on history, the likely outcome of fervent nationalism and burgeoning xenophobia, but at the time it was decried as outrageous.Looking back on it, however, they were vindicated in their assumptions and the division that spawned from the Trump Administration will last far longer than his mere one term presidency.Needless to say, on his platform which asserted ‘America first,’ Trump skated into a Presidential victory in 2016“Donald Trump is my President”The newly elected President Trump wasted no time in beginning to implement his vision of an America put before all others, and one of which only his supporters would benefit from.In January of his first year as president, Trump sent out an executive order which would in fact ban migrants from Muslim countries for 90 days. The outrage was extensive and many saw it as a xenophobic attempt to halt non-Europeans from entering America.As expected, the outrage morphed into formal litigation as the ACLU ran to the aid of Muslims being denied entry upon their arrival, as well as multiple federal judges blocking the order temporarily.It was one of the more hypocritical moves made by the Trump Administration, which seemed to be a bit paradoxical. On the campaign trail, he would tout the “America first!” standpoint loudly from his pulpit, while also trying to appeal to minority voters and immigrants. Just in 2019, he called for the “largest numbers ever” in legally entering the US. However, at every turn, he made it inaccessible for many to enter under the Muslim Ban. It is evident that Trump wanted their support and placated them on a superficial level while actively working against immigrants looking to enter America.Seemingly drawn to controversy, just months later in June, President Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement. Under such an agreement, the main objectives were to lower the emission of greenhouse gases that were creating drastic climate change and lower the global temperature to stall such change. The US was meant to be a main member of the agreement, as the US is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China who releases double that amount.On top of all this, the rallying cry for his supporters during this period was “facts don’t care about your feelings.” Yet, when faced with legitimate scientific research, Trump fell back on his own beliefs and perhaps prejudices to inform his actions as President.Packing the CourtsAssociate Justice Anthony Kennedy retired from the Supreme Court after serving for 30 years, leaving his seat vacant to eventually be filled by Brett Kavanaugh. After hearing of the news regarding Kavanaugh’s nomination, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford — a California professor of psychology who met Kavanaugh at a high school party — wrote a letter and later testified at the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing under penalty of perjury that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a gathering in the early 1980s.The nomination of Kavanaugh speaks to the continued dissolve of character exuded by Trump’s Republican Party. Rather than avoid toxic political figures, Republicans over the last decade have continually cozied up to them. At the time of Kavanaugh’s nomination, the population of the United States was about 326 million. Denying Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, according to Sen. Lindsay Graham, would have “destroyed [his] life.” If not serving on the Supreme Court destroys a person’s life, then there are 326,000,993 American lives ruined.This gaslighting and practice of anti-cancel-culture, by claiming that the mere act of holding people accountable for their actions is a threat to Americans everywhere serves as a weak way to excuse Trump’s actions.Following in his Supreme Court judge’s footsteps, 26 women, as of 2017, had accused Trump of varying levels of sexual misconduct. While Trump faced backlash for this, his core base of supporters ignored and frankly didn’t care about offensive and degrading comments Trump made, such as “grab them by the pussy.”Surely if Trump and his allies are painted negatively by the media every single day, the media must be “out to get Trump,” right? Another notable prelude to later years of the Trump era revolving around the Supreme Court were claims made by G.O.P Senators in 2018. Sen. Graham, at a forum with The Atlantic said, “I'll tell you this — this may make you feel better, but I really don't care — if an opening comes in the last year of President Trump's term, and the primary process has started, we'll wait until the next election.” Yet another promise made that was not kept at the end of it all.“Still Campaigning”As the Trump presidency continued, so too did his endless campaign. The Trump administration held their final press briefing of 2019 on March 15 of that year. Instead of facing the media, Trump chose to share details of his presidency through the 22 campaign rallies he held and of course, his (now banned) Twitter account. The year opened with Trump setting another record, when the longest government shutdown in history concluded at 35 days on Jan. 25. Then, after forcing the confirmation of Attorney General William Barr, Special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his report identifying Russian interference in the 2016 election along with the possible obstruction of justice by Trump.Mueller’s investigation charged 34 people, many with relations to the Trump campaign, with charges related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. At a Judiciary Committee hearing following Mueller’s report being submitted, he testified about his findings.“And what about total exoneration? Did you actually totally exonerate the president?” said Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-NY.“No,” said Mueller.The newly confirmed Attorney General Barr then released a heavily redacted version of the report to the public, which makes it largely unclear as to what the actual conclusions made by the Mueller report had been. In the time after fallout from the Mueller report, Trump continued his practice of allying himself with some of the absolute worst people. In April, Stephen Miller, a white nationalist, was installed as a White House adviser who was put in charge of Trump’s immigration policy.Miller’s “policy” — although it doesn’t deserve the dignity of being called a policy, moreso a horrid recreation of Japanese internment camps during World War II — was to separate families at the U.S.-Mexico border where children were locked in cages and continue to be incarcerated today.As the year closed, Trump was impeached for the first time after a transcript of a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was released which exposed that Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden and find campaign dirt on them. Trump had called on his supporters to “read the transcript,” which he drew on his earlier rhetoric during the Mueller report to argue his “total exoneration.” This was far from the truth, as Trump directly asked Zelensky to investigate the Biden family as payment for an increase in military aid the U.S. would offer to Ukraine.By this point it was true, nothing Trump did mattered. He knew that he could get away with anything, as he predicted while campaigning for his 2016 election. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters,” said Trump.By demonizing “cancel culture,” Trump spent the year following the Kavanaugh hearings in an accountability-free environment. He could benefit from Russian interference in an election, coerce a foreign government and eventually incite a deadly insurrection all without facing punishment. Trump managed to convince enough people that the biggest fear was not the myriad of crimes he had committed before and during his presidency, but instead the notion that somehow people would be no longer entitled to second chances.Trump had his second chance, and it will likely end the same as his first one — impeached for committing crimes against the United States, yet will face no consequences since apologists like Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) will argue that he’s “learned his lesson.”The Final Year of Trump — “Four too many”As we entered into the final year of Trump’s presidency, “World War III” seemed to be the biggest fear for the upcoming year. On Jan. 2, Trump ordered the airstrike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran’s top security and intelligence commander, leading to fears of another armed conflict in the middle east.Through February, fires ravaged California and Australia. Trump was acquitted in the senate for his high crimes and misdemeanors in relation to the Ukrainian phone call. He fired Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, adding yet another respected member of the military to the growing list of Trump adversaries after the earlier resignation of Defense Secretary Gen. Jim Mattis. The Coronavirus erupted throughout China, and in March the United States was forced to shut down due to the virus all but ensuring the year would quite frankly never get any better.Trump’s government failed to provide for its everyday, average Joe citizens facing economic challenges due to its own in-action. Instead, some American’s would receive an one-time $1,200, and wouldn’t receive further aid until a $600 check passed in late December.While American’s received approximately one month of rent over the roughly nine month span of the pandemic and over 574 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits, Republican legislators were sure to provide a $500 billion program to award loans to businesses at the direction of the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin with no oversight.In June, the New York Times reported that Russia had been offering bounties for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to the Taliban, and Trump eventually told Jonathan Swan in the infamous Axios interview from July that, “I have never discussed it with [Putin] ... frankly that’s an issue that many people said was fake news.”No credible source had called the report “fake news.”The most decisive actions the Trump campaign took over the summer didn’t relate to the Taliban bounties. It didn’t have to do with the pandemic that had caused almost 180,000 deaths by the end of August. It wasn’t about the murder of George Floyd and the protests surrounding police brutality that took place throughout the following months. Instead, he tried to ban TikTok, a social media app that some suggest played a role in the embarrassingly low attendance at Trump’s Tulsa rally in June, where campaign advisors touted potentially one million people would show up. That number, in actuality, was estimated to be 6,500.On Nov. 3, over 81 million Americans decided that they’d had enough of Donald Trump. Ironically, Biden beat Trump by the same margin in the electoral college that Trump defeated Clinton with in 2016, of which the ex-President referred to as a “landslide.” Following the election, Trump and his legal team fabricated lies about the integrity of this election while providing no evidence to support their bogus claims. Around 86 judges — some of which were Trump appointees — rejected one or more lawsuit filed by Trump and his allies.On Dec. 14, the states certified their electoral college votes, confirming the 306-232 win Biden held over Trump, although Trump’s challenges to the election absurdly continued despite having no legal basis for those claims.Instead, members of the congress again fabricated falsehoods alleging voter fraud with no evidence in an effort to overturn the will of the people who had just elected them to office. On Jan. 6, despite the efforts of rogue congressional members, the electoral college results were certified: Biden was officially declared the winner of the 2020 election and was set to be sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021.But perhaps the most egregious violation of the will of American people took place on Jan. 6 as Trump held a rally that ultimately encouraged people to storm the capitol building and organize a violent coup in an attempt to seize control of the government.This was a blatant intelligence failure by the capitol police and government officials who were unable to protect themselves from a violent militia. While intelligence is still being gathered, Democratic members of congress have alleged that Republican lawmakers had given tours of the Capitol to supporters of Trump in the days leading up to the attack.The way Trump’s presidency ended shouldn’t have come as a shock. Hillary Clinton knew what would happen when she said he would accuse the election of being rigged if he lost. Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling knew what would happen when he asserted that “Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed,” because of Trump.We need to start to do better and recognize these red flags that arise when politicians are speaking. If someone had said in 2016 that Trump losing would lead to him encouraging a coup, they would have been called an alarmist, just playing into the media’s hysteria.Trump Era Passes into HistoryIt’s been a long four years. While the Biden presidency will not save us, it should bring some much needed sanity to the White House. It’s important to analyze the history of what just happened to our country, so as to recognize the signs of a populist seeking the presidency. Donald Trump shattered the integrity and reputation of the United States, and got as far as inciting a terrorist mob to occupy its Capitol building for hours.As Trump leaves office and historians analyze the effects of his presidency, we can only be hopeful that nobody like him comes near the Oval Office again. Trump certainly was not the start to all of the problems America is facing today, but he played a critical role in exacerbating them.Joe Biden is inheriting a deadly pandemic, an economic deficit and one of the most divisive eras in American history — largely due to the actions Trump took during his presidency.We don’t have the knowledge and expertise to claim Trump was the worst president this country has seen. That is for the historians to decide. That being said, Trump has made some stains that will tarnish this country for decades, and may be irreversible if we don’t radically change the direction of the actions taken during his presidency.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/01/no-charges-against-officer-who-shot-jacob-blake,"January 6, 2021 | 9:13am CST","The police officer who shot Jacob Blake in Kenosha in August will not be charged with a crime, Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced Tuesday. Officer Rusten Sheskey shot and paralyzed Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, on Aug. 23 as Blake attempted to get into a car with his children inside. The video of the incident was widely shared on social media, leading to protests and violent unrest in the state. Graveley said it is “absolutely incontrovertible” that Blake was armed with a knife as he resisted arrest. According to Graveley’s report, Blake attempted to enter the driver’s side of the car when he twisted and moved his right hand with the knife toward Sheskey, who discharged his weapon four times in Blake’s back and three times in the side until the knife was dropped.“I do not believe the State could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Officer Sheskey was not acting lawfully in self-defense or defense of others which is the legal standard the State would have to meet to obtain a criminal conviction in this case,” Graveley’s report reads.Sheskey has worked for the Kenosha Police Department for seven years and was placed on administrative leave after the shooting. He remains on leave as of December. He has been the subject of five internal investigations, according to the AP.The Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation asked former Madison Police Chief and use-of-force expert Noble Wray to conduct an independent review of the case. Wray concluded in his report that Sheskey’s use of force was justified.The U.S. Attorney’s Office is conducting a parallel civil rights investigation. Graveley said that Kenosha “deserves” a second legal opinion. On the day in question, three officers, who did not have body cameras, were dispatched to an apartment complex for a domestic abuse call and knew that Blake had an arrest warrant. Blake had been previously charged in July with third-degree sexual assault, trespassing and disorderly conduct. He reached a plea deal in November and is serving two years probation.  Graveley said that the DA’s office does not intend to pursue charges against Blake in the August incident. There are also no “viable criminal charges” against the other two responding officers, according to Graveley’s report. “This is a tragedy for those who love Jacob Blake,” Graveley said Tuesday. “I want to acknowledge and say that I really feel like the Blake family and Mr. Blake himself have tried to be truly positive forces in the community, asking the community to have peaceful but real dialogue about change that I think is necessary in this community.”Braced for unrestGraveley acknowledged in his report that his decision “may be met with anger and outrage.”“Much of this anger will arise from the long history in our country of racial injustice, of systemic racism that has become embedded in our institutions including the criminal justice system and has influenced how our communities of color are policed and prosecuted,” Graveley wrote.Ben Crump, an attorney for Blake’s family, expressed disappointment with the decision on Twitter, saying it “failed not only Jacob and his family but the community that protested and demanded justice.”Blake’s family and other activists marched Monday evening ahead of the decision.The Kenosha Common Council passed a resolution Monday to allow Mayor John Antaramian to impose curfews during eight days after Graveley’s decision, despite opposition from the ACLU. Some businesses boarded up Tuesday, and National Guard members stood outside the county courthouse. On Monday, Gov. Tony Evers authorized the Wisconsin National Guard to support law enforcement in Kenosha at the request of local authorities. Peaceful protests in Kenosha on Tuesday night ended around 9:30 p.m. There were no immediate reports of violence, injury or damage to property, according to Kenosha News.In a Tuesday statement, Evers said “elected officials took no action” at a chance to enact police reform. In September, following the shooting, the Republican-led legislature opened and immediately adjourned a special session on police reform without debates or votes.“Today’s decision is further evidence that our work is not done — we must work each day in earnest toward a more just, more fair, and more equitable state and country, and to combat the racism experienced by Black Wisconsinites,” Evers said.In a statement Tuesday, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul called for Wisconsin to adopt a statewide use-of-force standard and for the legislature to provide funding for body cameras.Rittenhouse pleads not guiltyAlso on Tuesday, Kyle Rittenhouse entered not guilty pleas on the charges he faces, which include first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide, attempted first-degree intentional reckless homicide and violation of curfew on the night of the shootings, according to NPR. Rittenhouse is accused of shooting three men, two of whom were killed, during unrest in Kenosha. Rittenhouse is free on a $2 million bond. Conservatives have been raising money for his legal team, according to the AP.Rittenhouse was 17 at the time of the shooting and was charged as an adult. He is scheduled to return to court on March 10.This story will be updated as more information is released.state news writer",No charges against officer who shot Jacob Blake,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/01/trumps-term-to-end-with-extortion,"January 4, 2021 | 8:59pm CST","It was revealed on Sunday, Jan. 3, that President Trump, in truly bizarre fashion, intimidated and attempted to coerce Republican Secretary of State of Georgia Brad Raffensperger into “finding” approximately 12,000 votes in Georgia, which would in turn secure him the 16 electoral votes from the state. On Sunday, The Washington Post published the audio as well as a full transcript of the call placed between President Trump, his lawyers, Secy. Raffensperger and Ryan Germany. The conference call was initially in regards to reviewing the claims of fraud within the state of Georgia’s election process, but it quickly devolved into an unhinged barrage of unsubstantiated claims, as well as intimidation tactics on the part of the president. Throughout the call, Trump falsely repeated dozens of times that he, in fact, won the state of Georgia by “hundreds of thousands of votes” and that Raffensperger was deliberately ignoring Trump’s allegations and withholding investigations into the matter, according to the Washington Post. On multiple occasions, he also provided erroneous statistics from unverified sources that were meant to prove that the election had been falsified, but were directly challenged by Secy. Raffensperger and Germany.At one point, Trump falsely claimed that upwards of 5,000 deceased citizens voted (See claim #1) in Georgia during the 2020 Election, but Raffensperger quickly denied his inaccurate figures and corrected the president by stating that their investigations only found two deceased voters.Indignantly, Trump then berated Raffensperger by questioning his motives for challenging the President’s claims and stated that “big tech was on [Raffensperger’s] side,” as well as highlighting the Secretary of State’s lack of party loyalty, by repeatedly emphasizing that Raffensperger is a Republican and inferring that he should want a ‘fair’ outcome for the President because of it. As if rejecting verified reports from the Georgia Secretary of State regarding the election results was not bad enough, the president then said rather bluntly: “All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,” according to the Washington Post. In reality, Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes, and the President is clearly asking for one more vote to overtake him and win the state.It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the most grotesque uses of Presidential powers that the American public has seen in decades. It somehow almost triumphs over President Clinton’s administration actively discrediting his survivors of sexual assault. Despite the backdrop of unsubstantiated claims of mass voter fraud from the president for the past few months, Trump has finally delivered the American people undeniable proof of an attempt to artificially alter the outcome of the election. Such an attempt was, unsurprisingly, perpetrated by the president himself, instead of an unsanctioned act by one of his cronies. Stunningly, in front of multiple witnesses on the call, he asked Raffensperger to “find” votes which would overturn the 2020 Election in Georgia. It is impossible to determine what disaster of logic had to befall this man for him to make such an outrageous and illegal request so casually on a recorded phone call, even if he was being recorded without his knowledge. The irony and hypocrisy is astounding, as Trump has repeated without repose that the election was stolen from him, but now it is revealed he wishes to follow the same course of action that he alleged Biden adopted.Right-wing apologists were out in droves, as many stated that the president “misspoke” and that he simply wants all legal votes to be counted. That may very well be the case, but that is not what he said. You can try to alter it to fit a narrative, but when he thought his words were safe behind closed doors, he spoke quite deliberately as to how he wished for votes to be “found.”If the conservatives who have been bellowing “Stop the Steal” for the past two months have an iota of self-awareness and consistency, they would immediately see that such requests by the president are the epitome of everything they have decried. But alas, party loyalty prevails over moral principles.What kind of logical dissonance has to occur within this group of people for them to support the very kind of actions they were vilifying Biden for, who was vindicated by multiple probes?The answer as to why the right will immediately contort their viewpoints to the current developments is simple: ideological possession. The ideal that Trump is the underdog, the persecuted, the righteous man, is something that cannot be tarnished for his supporters. In completely buying that he is this herculean figure in American politics, anything Trump does is simply an attempt to battle the establishment. Supporters refuse to acknowledge that these new developments exhibit a wholly anti-democratic move by the president.This debacle is highly troubling, as it underscores that even during the last few weeks of his presidency, Trump is trying to subvert the Constitution as well as the outcome of a free election by illicit means.Unfortunately, the nightmare was not yet finished. Before the call ended, Trump accused Raffensperger and his team of allowing fraud to go unchecked within the state of Georgia, and added that doing so is “a criminal offense” and Raffensperger would be taking “a big risk” by not complying with the president’s requests.This is sheer intimidation and corruption, and it should not be a partisan issue to state so either. The president is caught on tape alluding that if Georgia’sSecretary of State was to not follow his instructions, criminal charges would follow. The contortions one has to make to excuse this type of blatant extortion by a sitting president is beyond laughable; it is unhinged. This is comparable to the Nixon Tapes, yet many on the right still try to excuse it. To make matters worse for Republicans, a Raffensperger adviser told Politico that they recorded the conversation with Trump because such illegal requests were not uncommon from prominent Republicans. This adviser stated: “Lindsey Graham asked us to throw out legally cast ballots. So yeah, after that call, we decided maybe we should do this.”Evidently, illegal requests and extortion are a common enough occurrence from the president and his supporters that government officials feel the need to document their exchanges as a way to exonerate themselves of any wrongdoing, as well as to place a spotlight on this egregious corruption.However, Jesse Kelly, a right-wing host, feels that the true crime committed regarding this phone call is the breach of “man code” in releasing this audio. He also added that “you don’t repeat things that are said to you privately.” In other words, “snitches do indeed get stitches.” This is just a taste of the deflecting we will see in the coming weeks, such as the belief that releasing audio of a sitting president intimidating officials into falsifying election results is not the real trespass here.This phone call is not just proof of a serious lack of ethical judgement, but also of a propensity for criminal activity. It was illegal. There is no sugar coating that.In the current aftermath, prominent Democrats, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), are beginning to clamor for new impeachment charges to be brought against Trump, which would mark the second impeachment proceeding of his first and only term.The question that Americans should be asking themselves is this: How many other officials has Trump intimidated and extorted behind closed doors? Georgia is only one of the states he would require to overturn, so it is not a stretch of the imagination to question if he made similar requests to officials in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.If any of this can be considered humorous, it is that President Trump has finally been vindicated in his claims of election fraud. Secy. Raffensperger and his team did exactly what Trump had been asking for: they uncovered evidence of election tampering and made it accessible for the people of the nation.Ian-Michael is an Opinion Editor at The Daily Cardinal and a freshman studying Political Science and Journalism.

One of the policies in question, UWS 17 in the Wisconsin Administrative Code, allows the university to discipline a student in nonacademic matters for engaging in behavior such as dangerous conduct, sexual misconduct, stalking and violation of the law.""""  Suchita Shah, a UW-Madison senior, said she thought some of the misconducts, such as """"violation of the law,"""" should not allow the university to discipline a student.  """"I don't want students to think that with these changes we will be looking at every single little thing they do, like jay-walking,"""" Assistant Dean of Students Ervin Cox said.  According to the proposed changes to UWS 17, the provisions will only apply to student conduct that occurs off-campus when the conduct """"adversely affects a substantial university interest.""""  Associate Dean of Students Kevin Helmkamp said a student violates substantial university interest if """"[that] student's misconduct or criminal activity off campus reflects poorly on academic integrity.""""  Helmkamp said too many offenses jeopardize the reputation and integrity of various UW-Madison schools, and students should care about how the actions of their classmates are dealt with by the universities.   However, both Helmkamp and Cox stressed strict rules could deter from students' educational experiences.  Cox said the term """"substantial university interest"""" should be flexible so students could argue in their hearing that a charge is not in the university's interests.   If the university went after every individual drinking case, a student could make a case that it is not really substantial, Cox said.  """"Now, if they get drunk and beat up a citizen of Madison, it's a whole different kind of matter,"""" he said. Helmkamp said some parents complain the rules are too vague.  """"Everyone wants you to get tougher right up until they understand the nuances of the decision,"""" he said, adding parents tend to change their mind once their child is affected.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/11/checkered-history-still-haunts-japan,"November 16, 2014 | 10:27pm CST"," History is often very sentimental and objective at the same time. Because of these two views of history, political management and learning from past mistakes is difficult. The second World War is a perfect example of history affecting current political environments. As devastating and impactful as WWII was, the lessons can still be misinterpreted. The memories of World War II are often preserved, erased and altered. One example of historical alteration is taking place within Japan.The Japanese empire’s dominant expansion in the early twentieth century across Asia  came with great costs. Its dominance was hardly good willed imperialism with the intention of moving Asian countries towards modernization. One of its most controversial crimes committed during the war is being purposely altered under the regime of Prime Minster Shinzo Abe today. This crime is that of the Japanese use of “comfort women.” Hillary Clinton famously  referred to these women as ‘enforced sex slaves.’ Many women from the conquered areas were subjected to forced sexual slavery for soldiers. Rape of women is no longer an unfamiliar topic during war and invasions. For example, many German women in Berlin during the Soviet takeover were raped.According to The New York Times, the formation of brothels in the army was uncontroversial to Japanese tradition at the time. In 1942, Japan’s Imperial Navy lieutenant paymaster Yasuhiro Nakasone organized a military brothel, or “comfort station” in order to discourage sexual misconduct, gambling and fighting among soldiers. Across Asia, from Vietnam to Burma, women were considered to be the first reward of conquest for soldiers. These atrocious acts were apparently not considered criminal as Mr. Nakasone served as  prime minster of Japan from 1982 to 1987.Under the new regime of Prime minster Abe, these stories are being slowly fabricated. Back in 2007, the cabinet undermined the Kono Statement, a formal apology for the front-line encampments that provided sex for the military made by prime minster Yohei Kono in 1993. The regime denied the statement for lacking documentary evidence of coercion in the acquisition of women for the military’s comfort stations.However, there is enough evidence to verify the existence of these houses during the war. In October, Mr. Abe directed his government to “step up a strategic campaign of international opinion so that Japan can receive a fair appraisal based on matters of objective fact.” The Japanese government  even went as far as to send an officer two weeks later to New York to convince former UN special rapporteur on violence against women, Radhika Commaraswamy, to revise her accusation regarding the  Japanese army’s violence against women during the war. However  she refused to revise her 1996 statement which stated, “the consistency of the accounts of women from quite different parts of Southeast Asia of the manner in which they were recruited and the clear involvement of the military and government at different levels is indisputable.”The testimonies of sexual violence by the Japanese soldiers are large in number, from Southeast Asian women to Pacific Islanders to an American nurse. The stories from different people all tell that the Japanese committed war crimes against many women. However, the Japanese government’s attempts to hide these accusations continue to grow as the chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, vowed to continue to advocate international bodies to remove the designation of comfort women as sex slaves.The major reason why the Japanese government is increasingly attempting to hide its violent past is due to the fact that ever since the end of the war, Japan’s goverment has been made largely from participants in the war. They continue to hold on to the power today because they accumulated wealth and high education as elite groups. Because of this, the quest for the truth has become very difficult. Today, Japanese people are taught history absent of its atrocious past. There are so many memories that remain hidden. For example, we know Winston Churchill as one of the leaders who saved Europe from the evils of Hitler, but did you know he was also responsible for ordering the genocide on Kurds who resisted British occupation or starving thousands of Indians? History is not there to judge bad or good in extremely segregated fashions, I believe, because it is full of contradictions. In the case of Japan, it has a long way to go toward a more conscientious decision in coming up with a way to educate its citizens about the past in a more honest fashion. Despite being good or bad, history remains history. How should we deal with such contradictions?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/dane-county-judge-grants-release-of-training-videos-of-brad-schimel,"October 30, 2014 | 8:34pm CDT","Dane County Circuit Court Judge Richard Niess ordered the state Department of Justice to release training videos of Republican attorney general candidate Brad Schimel on Thursday.The Democratic Party of Wisconsin prompted the decision by requesting the release of five videos featuring Schimel over the last several years. Democrats claim the videos show Schimel engaging in misconduct while carrying out a training exercise on how to apprehend and prosecute sexual predators.The DOJ said it could only find recordings of two of the training sessions. Niess, after viewing the two available videos, claimed there was no misconduct on behalf of Schimel. He also found no justification for withholding the tapes from the public.“In my judgment there’s no reason the public should not know the contents of these tapes,” Niess said, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.Schimel claimed releasing the videos would undermine public safety.“I believe giving defense attorneys and predators our playbook would put public safety at risk,” Schimel said in an email. “Shame on Susan Happ’s allies who are willing to jeopardize public safety for politics.”Josh Lease, one of Happ’s campaign managers, was more concerned with the three missing training session videos.“There is reason to believe those are the ones with the most damaging footage of Schimel's presentations, and now they have mysteriously disappeared,” Lease said in an email.Niess stayed his ruling until Friday, allowing time for the DOJ to appeal, as Assistant Attorney General Anthony Russomanno said they would.If the DOJ appeals, Niess indicated he would reevaluate the issue Monday, one day before the election.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/10/read-carefully-on-the-personal-issues-of-political-candidates,"October 31, 2016 | 12:00pm CDT","As the the presidential election draws closer, many of us await the future with great anticipation. All of us seek a better future regardless of how different our anticipated paths may be, and thus the presidential election holds the attention of many as it plays a determining role in the policies that affect our lives. There are many ways to access information on politics these days to help determine which candidate to vote for, and it has never before been so easy to acquire such knowledge with the power of the internet, social media, television and the radio. Not surprisingly, as our network of information has grown, so has the range of the knowledge we are presented with—from petty personal blogs and comments to extensive records of the candidates’ lives. This trend begs several questions: What topics should we focus on, and how well should we know them? Just like how we start studying for the exam by selecting which sets of topics will be covered from the lessons, studying politics also requires diligence and selecting the most relevant information. Because we have so many sources of information these days presented in many different ways, it has become important for us to develop skills to select which topics are the most important. But it is also difficult to develop a standard to determine what to remember and what to forget, as everyone has different backgrounds and interests they wish to focus on. Even with these difficulties, I still believe it is a good idea to at least talk about how we should handle this mass of information regarding the political process, as it helps to work towards a general solution. How much should we know, whether personal or political? Until recently I have believed that personal stories and issues may not be the most vital tool in determining the viability of certain candidates in running the country. But after learning about the recent presidential scandal in South Korea, I realized that sometimes the personal stories of leaders can have an impact on their ability to govern. According to a recent CNBC report Oct. 27, President Park revealed in a televised apology that she received help on state affairs from an old friend and informal advisor named Choi Soon-sil. It is still a developing story, but Ms. Choi is mainly accused of having access to classified material related to national security and conomic policies, and of interfering in key governmental affairs by establishing two nonprofit foundations using funds from corporate donations. Many South Korean citizens are petitioning for impeachment, criticizing the president’s lack of consideration of classified information, and it has caused for a growing distrust of the government. Not only that, it is reported that the confusion and shock caused by “Choi-gate” could delay the National Assembly’s passage of the 2017 budget and have an impact on the economic progress of the nation. I am aware that not all countries share similar stories of how the personal histories and lives of leaders can impact the welfare of the nation, but I believe it is quite important to know as many details about candidates as possible. However, we should narrow down what information is the most important and pertinent. All personal and public histories of the candidates should be related to the welfare of the nation more than anything else. We should not be distracted by unnecessarily petty personal stories, but focus on the things that could determine the qualities of our lives. You might need to learn about the personal histories of the candidates who you will cast your vote for as long as they could be related to  governmental policies. The Clinton email problem? The Trump tax scandal or sexual misconduct from the past? The first could impact how the new government would handle classified information and the latter could foresee how the future cabinet would handle policies related to economic inequality or women. Make yourself as aware as possible about how these issues could influence our lives.Although government officials and candidates are often held in check by media outlets, we realize that we don’t always get all the details of everything  going on in Washington. We might get some glimpse of certain things from public legislation, governmental information posts and media outlets—but not all. As important as confidentiality can be, our right to know as much as possible also needs to be protected. We need to decide for ourselves which candidate would perform best. In order to make such a determination, we also should learn as much as possible about the qualifications of these individuals. For example, if Candidate A had been a fervent supporter of a previously controversial idea and later switched to a more moderate belief, then you should decide for yourself how to interpret this change. Was there an actual change of heart, or was it simply made to appeal to the general populace? We often see changes from one position to another as a sign of a lack of credibility of the candidate on the issue—however, should we see it only in that way? We are looking for the candidate who can do the job and has worked hard to serve all Americans. As long as our leadership is taking us in the right direction, very little else matters. That’s why we need to know as much as possible about politics—because if we only look at one side of the story, we may miss out on a leader who can help the country realize its full potential. As we all know, the upcoming presidential election is vital to continuing the legacy of our nation. I believe it’s equally significant for us to have a moment to discover how to make a good political choice. When all is said and done, we should try our very best to try to pick a candidate who will serve our personal and communal interests. In order to do so, we need to refine the skills we need to learn more deeply and effectively about the qualifications of the candidates—whether they’re really a good fit to run our great country. So as we now benefit from an abundance of information, let’s make good use of it to build towards an ideal future. Let’s not let the massive amount of information available to us cloud our will to make this country a better place to live.Hae Rin is a junior majoring in history.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/10/nps-director-talks-centennial-goals-sexual-harassment-claims,"October 10, 2016 | 11:00pm CDT","In a nearly packed Shannon Hall Monday night, Director of the National Parks Service Jonathan Jarvis took the stage as part of the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies’ Jordahl Public Lands lecture to address the NPS centennial and recent sexual harassment allegations surrounding park employees.As NPS director, Jarvis is responsible for more than 22,000 employees, a $3 billion budget and more than 400 national parks. This year being the NPS’ 100th anniversary, Jarvis and the NPS have focused their park mission on maximizing stewardship, expanding education, ensuring employee welfare and engaging new generations.The goal of the centennial, Jarvis said, is to create the next generation of NPS visitors, supporters and advocates that look like America. He emphasized that the park system is patriotic, embodying both nature and national monuments. Jarvis hopes that he can make American youth into contributing citizens by introducing them to the NPS.“I know that I can take any young person regardless of their age, their socioeconomic status or experience and take them under those giant trees of the Sequoia National park, to view the waterfalls in Yosemite or to the rim of the Grand Canyon and watch their eyes light up,” Jarvis said.Through working with youth in various outreach programs, Jarvis is gearing up for what he referred to as the “intergenerational hand-off” of the NPS.“This next generation is very excited … I’ve been with thousands of young people that are just really cool and really excited and really interested in getting involved,” Jarvis said.On a heavier note, however, Jarvis addressed a scandal that has concerned NPS employees and visitors alike. In the wake of sexual harassment allegations flooding in from employees at the Grand Canyon, and more recently Yosemite and Yellowstone, Jarvis noted the actions the NPS plans to take in order to address the situation.This hostile work environment, according to Jarvis, is unacceptable as a part of the NPS’ culture.“I am incredibly disappointed that actions like this have happened inside of an organization that values public service to both the American public and international visitors and to the resources that are entrusted to us by you,” Jarvis said.He called the victims who have spoken up courageous, praising them for giving the NPS the opportunity to directly address the situation, however long it may take.“The park service is addressing this very aggressively and will be for years to come,” Jarvis said, adding that the NPS has reached out to other organizations who have faced similar misconduct claims.The NPS has a four-fold plan Jarvis hopes will help them move forward. It includes a survey of employees to help victims report incidents of harassment, employee training, installing networks of support and garnering greater preventative effort from NPS leaders.In a male-dominated field, Jarvis noted that the internal culture within which women have to work has never been addressed. He believes that through outreach efforts, particularly a survey, victims of sexual harassment will feel empowered and supported.Confident the NPS can raise awareness and break the stigma surrounding sexual harassment, Jarvis hopes for a bright future for the NPS, which will lose 10 percent of its workforce in the near future to retirement. This provides an opportunity for the younger generation to step up, Jarvis said.“In 20 years, I hope that the conservation movement, advocacy organization, land management agencies look like America and have been embraced by all Americans; that they find themselves they define who they are in their lives through experiences in our national parks.”","NPS director talks centennial goals, sexual harassment claims",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/10/training-needed-for-suicide-prevention,"October 5, 2017 | 8:00am CDT","According to UHS, 9 percent of UW-Madison students have reported experiencing suicidal ideations over the past year. While that statistic is a single digit, think about it this way — in your lecture of 400, that means that just under 40 people have contemplated suicide over the past year. While the causes and factors that contribute to mental illness are largely varied and sometimes unknown, college conditions can exacerbate this already prevalent issue.Suicide is a very real disease for college students across the country. According to the National Institute on Mental Health, suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students in the United States. As suicide is a disease that so many of our peers are dealing with, we should make more of an effort to educate our campus about how we can prevent it and its effects. Knowing the signs of someone who is demonstrating behavior that suggests they might be contemplating suicide is critical if we are going to make an impact with suicide prevention efforts on campusAs suicide is both far-reaching and life threatening, one would expect that college campuses put a heavy emphasis on prevention efforts. While UHS does offer a host of counseling options, as well as more informal groups and a 24-hour hotline, not everybody who needs suicide prevention messaging receives it. According to the American College Health Association, 80 to 90 percent of college students who die by suicide did not receive help from their university counseling center. As the people who need help and support might not be getting it, community intervention is integral in ensuring the safety of our community.“People think — this is a common misconception — that if you ask them, ‘Are you considering suicide?’ that it’s going to put the idea in their head,” UW-Madison National Alliance on Mental Illness vice president Hannah Glasrud said. “But the truth is, if they’re thinking about suicide, there is no way you’re introducing this idea to them.”This common misconception about suicide would be easily disproved with scientific research and education. However, not many people are informed on how or when to intervene in a crisis situation. Knowing the signs of someone who is demonstrating behavior that suggests they might be contemplating suicide is critical if we are going to make an impact on suicide prevention efforts on campus.“Eighty percent of people who commit suicide told somebody first,” Glasrud said. “So it’s not like they’re silent. There are cues. Eighty percent of people verbally communicated that they were going to go kill themselves, and did.”Incoming freshmen undergo mandatory trainings each year, such as the Alcohol Edu and U Got This programs, which teach students about alcohol usage and sexual misconduct on campus, and how to prevent it. A similar program teaching students about suicide and other mental health issues, and how to spot signs and intervene, would be invaluable for our campus population.A program for this currently exists through UHS, but is not mandatory. The At-Risk program aims to help students “recognize students in distress, respond appropriately and refer to campus and local resources,” according to UHS. It is currently being promoted, but has only been taken by 2,100 students since its debut two years ago, according to UHS suicide prevention coordinator Valerie Donovan. While UHS expects the program to reach 1,000 more students this upcoming year, that is only a fraction of the campus population.By making the At-Risk training mandatory, we would enable many incoming students to recognize their peers who were in a mental crisis and help them to properly intervene. It would also educate them about mental health and suicide so that any societally accepted myths were dispelled. Incoming students would be armed with an arsenal of knowledge that could help them be more aware of a disease that affects almost 10 percent of the population, and ways to help those affected.Suicide is preventable. With a more concentrated effort in requiring mandatory prevention and awareness training we can make great strides in helping our classmates who may be suffering. By learning to dispel the stigma about suicide we can help make this campus an open place to discuss mental health issues and show those struggling that they are not alone.If you or someone you know is in crisis please call 1-800-273-8255.

His record, the Oshkosh Northwestern reported, hadn’t followed him there.“Ensuring the safety of our students and our employees at every institution is one of the most vital responsibilities of the Board of Regents,” said Regent Vice President Drew Petersen in an August statement. “As we develop and implement these policies, we must be clear that employee misconduct at one UW System institution will not be hidden if they seek to work somewhere else within UW System. We are proactively taking steps to prevent such occurrences.”According to a schedule outlined by the policy planning committee in October, implementation plans will be finalized by Dec. 3, and the System hopes to begin enforcing the policy come January 2019.Chancellor Rebecca Blank explained that questions regarding sexual misconduct history are generally not asked during interviews, but uncomfortable as they may seem, they are nevertheless critical to making good hiring decisions.“It’s a difficult area and I think the right answer is you just want to ask everyone,” Blank said. “I now have to ask whenever I do a reference check under system policy. I think more and more, institutions are likely to adopt those sorts of policies to stay on the front end.”",UW System begins to finalize new hiring process to stop ‘passing the harasser’,UWM

The complaint states that the university ""acted with deliberate indifference to Beitz' sexual harassment of the plaintiff.""The victim filed for compensation for physical and psychological injury as well as medical and educational expenses, according to the civil complaint.According to the complaint, university administrators ""had actual notice of Beitz' misconduct based on complaints they had received from a student and a student parent in December 2012 and January 2013 regarding his inappropriate sexual relationship with plaintiff.""The former UW-Oshkosh student said what began as a consensual partnership with Bietz in 2012 turned emotionally abusive and sexually coercive after she attempted to end the relationship a year later.According to documents released with the complaint, Beitz forced sex from his student, engaged in “intimidating and demeaning” behavior and the university failed to intervene even after the plaintiff provided documentation.In May, the Oshkosh Northwestern reported that Bietz left his position at UW-Oshkosh voluntarily in 2015 for a tenure-track teaching job at the University of Colorado Boulder.Beitz’s case is one of three confirmed instances and 15 total complaints of sexual harassment at UW-Oshkosh in the last five years — the second highest total number of complaints in the UW System in that period, according to the article.",UW-Oshkosh student seeks justice in federal court for neglected sexual harassment reports against professor,UWM

He now holds the same title at UW-Eau Claire.“When these policies and procedures are in place, the end result must ensure that employee misconduct at one UW institution cannot be hidden as they seek to work somewhere else within our system,” Behling said.The resolution stated all universities will share personnel files of all current and former employees with one another when an individual is considered for employment. This also requires all UW System institutions to document allegations of sexual harassment involving an employee. Lastly, it requires all institutions to conduct “appropriate reference check procedures” for individuals being hired or transferring from a previous employer.“If someone is considering hiring a candidate and they do a reference and they find that there’s an allegation, even if it’s unsubstantiated, the mere existence of an allegation is likely to be sufficient to prevent the person from being hired,” Regent Robert Atwell said.The proposal will also consider current sexual harassment policies of universities on a nationwide scale, especially focused around schools in the Big Ten, to shape the new policy.In December 2016, a recommendation implored all UW System employees and students complete proper sexual violence and harassment training. The training compliance rates among full-time employees was around 99.6 percent across all institutions within the UW System. The final student rates will be released in October.The sexual harassment policy work group was created to provide a state assessment of Title IX environment, along with a policy review and advanced training.The state assessment will analyze the reporting structure, chancellor involvement and compliance to policy changes and trainings.

In addition, the Missoulian reports that the messages were discovered after some of Plakorus’ former players reported that he was texting them “excessively, and at inappropriate times.”The Missoulian also reports that other evidence, such as Plakorus’ Tinder account — which contained evidence that he had been preying on women the same age as his players — had been reported to UM’s athletic director, although it never became an official investigation. The fact that evidence had been presented and was overlooked put Plakorus’ team and the entire University of Montana community at a higher risk for being victimized by the former coach. Montana is a member of the Big Sky Conference, and as of publication, that conference has not sanctioned the school or released any kind of statement in relation to Plakorus’ firing.While Montana's scandal appears on the surface to be small potatoes compared to Nassar, it is still imperative that substantive action is taken in order to make athletes feel safe and comfortable in their competitive environments. Coaches like Plakorus, who prey on their athletes as well as non-athlete students in the same age bracket, should not be allowed to continue to be on the sidelines because they present a clear and present danger to the safety of their school communities.While we wait for the results of the NCAA and DOE investigations regarding Michigan State, it is just as important to make sure that other athletics employees committing sexual misconduct around the country are investigated and held accountable — if athletic departments fail to act, they are failing their entire community.UPDATE May 5, 2018 3:01 p.m.: This article previously included false information taken from an inaccurate source about a university swimming coach.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/the-problem-of-tekashi-6ix9ine-and-todays-rappers,"February 4, 2018 | 6:00am CST","On Jan. 29, Daniel Hernandez — known by his stage name, Tekashi 6ix9ine (pronounced “six-nine”) — posted a celebratory video on his Instagram. The post announced his debut mixtape, DAY69, out Feb. 23, as he recapped his achievements in 2017 with his daughter by his side. 6ix9ine was positive in his message, telling artists of all forms to follow their dreams against whatever criticism may follow. However, further investigation of 6ix9ine’s life and music will reveal there is little to be happy about. If what 6ix9ine is speaking is the truth, the release of his full-fledged mixtape will represent a very troublesome step forward for an up-and-coming artist and other rappers of his generation, all of whom are detrimental to both hip-hop and society as a whole.The accessibility of the internet has changed the way music is dispersed and how musicians gain popularity. Chance the Rapper made two mixtapes before going to Lollapalooza in 2014 and is now one of rap’s biggest names. However, it has also allowed artists without much musical merit to thrive on streaming services like YouTube and SoundCloud. 6ix9ine is one of the most popular rappers to gain steam online, as his hit single “GUMMO” earned a place on Spotify’s RapCaviar playlist and has amassed over 41 million plays. His newest single, “KEKE” — which features Fetty Wap and A Boogie wit da Hoodie — has replaced “GUMMO” on RapCaviar and already has 10 million plays on Spotify. There are two sides to every coin, and if Chance the Rapper and Justin Bieber are on one side, 6ix9ine is the face on the other side.With a rainbow grill and shoulder-length hair of similar colors, he’s an easy face to recognize. A large number of tattoos also cover his face, hands and chest, with many of those tattoos being the number 69. It’s his music, however, that really makes him unforgettable. The most noticeable and instantly detestable feature of his music is its language. “GUMMO” has 27 counts of the n-word over two minutes and 38 seconds of music, which evens out to one n-word every six seconds. It goes without saying that a non-black person should never use that word, and yet 6ix9ine normalizes its usage as an American of Latino descent. He may not be white, but as a minority myself, I can tell you that the n-word has no place in my vocabulary or his.As I pushed through 6ix9ine’s poor word usage, the rest of “GUMMO” is as awful as his vocabulary. While still a relatively young genre, hip-hop has a dense history — having dealt with the glorification of violence, among other issues — but you would be hard pressed to deny the impact and art of N.W.A. and other great classic artists. On the other hand, there is not an ounce of this originality or artistry in “GUMMO,” “KEKE” or any other 6ix9ine song. Instead, he objectifies women as he recycles the same crime-focused narratives, relying on racial slurs and profanity as the base of his derivative flow. In short, his music is bad and cannot compare to the hip-hop artists of old or even his contemporaries of today. And yet, somehow, he continues to grow in popularity.Even with the Weinstein Effect that has gripped the world, 6ix9ine continues to gain fame. On Dec. 14 last year, Jezebel broke a story detailing 6ix9ine’s plea agreement to charges of sexual misconduct with a minor, but his public image and music remains unscathed. He does not stand alone either: Rapper Kodak Black was charged with sexual misconduct in 2016 and awaits trial. XXXTentacion was arrested for aggravated battery but was still signed a reported $6 million record deal this past October. And now, claiming he has signed a $7.5 million deal, we have 6ix9ine, the most recent example of individuals who are not only bad musicians, but bad people.The world continues to change, and music has with it. What must remain constant in the face of all this change is the need for quality art and the refusal of intolerance and marginalization. 6ix9ine is not the first musician to lack ability and be a terrible person while attaining fame, but I would like to hope that he could be among the last of them. His music is wack, and it’s up to consumers like us to support great music while rejecting bad music. If there’s anything art has taught us, it is that art makes a difference, and music such as 6ix9ine’s doesn’t make a positive one.",The problem of Tekashi 6ix9ine and today’s rappers,UWM

According to Bean, an art professor allowed her into his senior-level class despite her lack of prerequisites, and offered her private drawing lessons. During the lesson, she said he led her into a small, locked room and asked her to pose and take off her sweater. Bean said the professor then commented on her body and tried to lift up her shirt, which is when she stopped him. “I felt like I was in a bad dream and was so uncomfortable I didn’t know what to do,” she wrote. Bean also described her experience reporting the incident and the response she received from the university. After going to human resources last semester, Bean said an investigation was opened, but she didn’t receive any updates until she emailed officials herself. She said the university emailed her back the morning before she wrote her Facebook post. “We wanted to inform you that we reviewed the matter and have communicated expectations to the faculty member in question,” read the email, which Bean attached as a screenshot in her Facebook post. “For the duration of your academic career at UWL, he has been instructed not to contact you.” Bean equated this response to “a slap on the wrist” and said the professor in question “gets to walk around like he is untouchable.” UW-La Crosse responded to Bean’s allegations against the unnamed professor in a statement where it recognized the initial communications misstep.“As an institution, we acknowledge the university should have been more prompt in communicating the result of this investigation to the student and regret the negative impact this had on the student,” the statement read.The university also stood by its initial handling of Bean’s complaint, saying it has also taken steps so the professor and art department are working on maintaining appropriate instructor-student interactions.“While there was not a determination that our policies were violated in this case, we nevertheless took action to protect the student from retaliation or other disruptions to academic opportunities during the investigation,” the statement said. “These measures will continue for the remainder of the student’s time at UWL.”UW-La Crosse also encouraged those who have experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct to reach out, linking to a webpage with more information and a guide to reporting an incident. However, Chancellor Joe Gow directed the case to be reopened due to “additional information [coming] to light.” Bean also posted screenshots of other students who have reached out and shared similar stories with her, some from other universities. “These students have had to deal with similar sexual harassment from their professors,” Bean wrote. “This needs to be brought to light so we can put an end to it.”",UW-La Crosse student accuses professor of sexual misconduct in social media post,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/02/what-happened-at-uw-whitewater-how-gender-dynamics-structural-inequities-affect-female-leaders,"February 21, 2019 | 1:14am CST","With a single sentence, Beverly Kopper resigned as chancellor of UW-Whitewater. In the six months prior, her ability to represent her campus and protect her students had been scrutinized amid allegations her husband perpetrated sexual misconduct. More, it is unclear if she knew about his behavior all along — or if she covered it up. While many community members pushed for Kopper’s resignation, others paused to ask if the backlash against her was fair, and what her departure means for women leaders in higher education.Kopper’s resignation may illuminate some of the structural inequities and gender politics ingrained in higher education systems that limit women’s ability to hold leadership roles in them, whether or not she facilitated her husband’s behavior. “There are multiple levels at which gender power works. It works at the institutional level or systemic level, it works at the interpersonal or relational level, and it works at the level of identity,.” said University of Buffalo Social Studies Education Program Director Sarah A. Robert. “Would a husband pay for the crimes of the wife?”The first allegations against Kopper’s husband Pete “Alan” Hill surfaced in June. He was banned from campus immediately afterward, and by October, a total of five women had come forward with stories of sexual misconduct. The women Hill harassed included former students and university employees. He had gained access to them through his unpaid, honorary role as “Associate of the Chancellor” — a position he received because of Kopper’s status.For as long as three years, the women grappled with their experiences, while their assailant and his wife remained in top university positions. The claims they made against him were not publicized by the university until last September, after the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel filed an open records request.Following those revelations, campus and community leaders demanded Kopper hand in her resignation. Complaints included accusations that Kopper had known about her husband’s behavior all along. At the very least, many were outraged that she potentially tried to conceal the allegations against him until it was clear they would be published anyway.A series of investigations followed — the details of which have not been revealed. Kopper faced accusations that she had created a “hostile workplace environment,” and mounting pressure to give up her role. These criticisms led her to resign on Dec. 6, shortly before she was scheduled to give UW-Whitewater’s winter commencement address. Her resignation letter was a single-sentence memo addressed to UW System President Ray Cross. ""I am aware that the Board of Regents would like different leadership for UW-Whitewater and thus I hereby render my resignation as Chancellor effective Dec. 31, 2018,” she wrote.The terms of Kopper’s exit agreement included a semester's leave at her full chancellor’s salary, as well as reentry as a tenured psychology professor starting next fall. In that role, she will be making 75 percent more than the average psychology faculty member. Kopper “had to go” because the allegations against her husband overshadowed her role of promoting the university, the Janesville GazetteXtra wrote in an op-ed. By appointing her husband to an honorary position, it said Kopper helped create a “toxic” campus environment. “UW-Whitewater Chancellor Beverly Kopper had to go and not only because of her lack of candidness regarding allegations of sexual harassment against her husband,” the editorial read. “We still haven’t learned what she knew and when she knew it.”Yet clearly, whatever she may or may not have known was not grave enough to strip her of her tenure.So, whatever criticisms have driven the outside analysis and debate to this point are distinctly speculative. And those speculations, Robert said, are rooted in the deep-seated gender biases that shape expectations an institution places on the people who serve it.“It does reflect what we understand of the university, which is that it is, for the most part, still a male-dominated institution,” she said. “Even while he’s not the leader of that institution, it doesn’t matter because he still has the keys to the castle.” “Social hostesses” to ChancellorsWomen have only emerged in higher education leadership roles within the last 20 years. Today, the percentage of women holding presidencies at colleges and universities stood at 30 percent in 2016, up just four percent from 2011, according to an American Council on Education report. Before that, men held top roles while their wives, said historian Clara Lovett, acted as their “social hostesses.”Lovett is a contributor to Inside Higher Ed who studies the evolving role of spouses in higher education. Before that, she was president of Northern Arizona University — one of the first women in the nation to hold such a high-ranking role.The “social hostesses” Lovett uncovered in her research were often young to middle-age, most with college degrees. If they had careers, nearly all put them on hold when their husbands took office. There were no written duties for these women, but the role they served was a tradition inherited from the generations before them. These were the wives who sat on — but rarely chaired — special action committees. They were the ones who poured tea at faculty meetings. Within that gendered world, there was no need to define the role of the spouse or the expectations that went with it. They were women who filled the roles, as Robert said, “without fault.” Just as the rise in female leaders is a more recent phenomenon, so is the emergence of their male spouses — which doesn’t take into account the leaders without partners or those who identify as LGBTQ+. “Now many spouses don’t fit those tradition roles,” Lovett said. “You have a multitude of roles, and the way in which university trustees hire presidents lags quite behind this changed reality.”Even though it is common for the president’s spouse to receive an honorary, unpaid role, universities seldom assign them formal positions. That is the case at both UW-Whitewater and UW-Madison, according to UW-Madison spokesperson Meredith McGlone. “It is customary for the spouse to receive what is known as a ‘zero dollar appointment’ — an unpaid position called ‘associate of the chancellor’ that allows them to be considered an employee for the purpose of access university facilities,” McGlone said.Blank’s spouse, Hanns Kuttner, was appointed to the same position as Hill when the UW-Madison chancellor took office in 2013. Both Hill and Kuttner were given official titles, a distinction that the UW System grants all chancellor's spouses, but that, historically, was rarely afforded to women who filled the expected role of the “social hostess.”Robert finds this to be very telling of the gender relations at play in higher education leadership and a pervading patriarchal culture in the United States.“For how many generations have women never been given a title? It was just assumed that they knew how to pour a good cup of tea,” she said. “But when it’s a man who is the spouse, they suddenly have to come up with an institutional role.” Both Lovett and Robert acknowledge the lack of clarity surrounding the unofficial spouse position, which extends well into the information — or lack thereof — that’s been released surrounding the investigation into Kopper’s husband. In this grey area, Lovett sees room for tensions to develop. It is harder to trace out accountability when no policy to establish it exists in the first place, she said.Robert reaffirmed that the qualities women were celebrated for are representations of weakness for men. If roles were switched, Hill “might be labeled effeminate and not in control of his household,” she said.  “The ‘president’s husband’ is often not an acceptable stand-in at an event, whereas the ‘president’s wife’ is,” the American Association of University Women Barriers and Bias report read. Breaking into the “boy’s club”Women haven’t traditionally held leadership roles in higher education. It’s an inequity begins as soon as women enter their institution’s doors as professors, where they often take on larger teaching loads for lower salaries compared to men. They also obtain tenure at a slower rate, according to the National Center for Higher Education Statistics. “Women’s underrepresentation as tenured and full professors in turn limits their opportunities to advance into formal leadership positions at colleges and universities. It is therefore not surprising that men outnumber women even among newly appointed deans, provosts, and presidents,” reads the American Association of University Women Barriers and Bias report. Men who are confident, assertive and self-promoting are respected, while women who share the same qualities are suggested to be “inappropriate” or “undesirable,” according to the AAUW report. “Sometimes seemingly benign comments can take a toll on women’s advancement. In one study, top female college and university leaders cited discouragement, sabotage, and unfair expectations as barriers to leadership,” the report read. These factors can prevent women from obtaining tenure, without which doors to other leadership roles within universities begin to close.“In tenure track positions, you find that men are married and have kids, their careers just skyrocket,” Robert said. “Women who are married and also have children are actually much less likely to even get tenure.”For Kopper, this meant serving as one of four female chancellors out of 13 in the UW System, which is consistent with the national average.And for aspiring women academics and leaders in the UW System and beyond, Robert says that the hostile workplace allegations leveled against Kopper send a somber message.“Unfortunately, they stand and they remain in people’s memory long after the person has walked away,” Robert said. “Those memories become the basis on which a candidate is passed over for a future leadership position. They become empty rationale and rhetoric for why women aren’t in more leadership roles.” But while others acknowledge that there are significant structural barriers preventing women from taking leadership roles — and that undermine women’s credibility once they land them — they say Kopper’s case does not illustrate these problems.“In principle, a woman or man should not suffer as a result of the actions of their spouse,” said UW-Madison Department of Gender and Women's Studies Chair Aili Tripp. “But as the Kopper case suggests, the real world situation may be more complicated, especially given the prevalence of outmoded understandings of the roles and responsibilities of the spouse.”Tripp does not think that any person should be held accountable for the actions of their spouse. However, if they try to hide those actions or don't take action to remedy the situation, then they claim some liability.And as long as the “outmoded model” of spouses as a team persists, Tripp said such problems can occur.  Both Robert and Lovett are hopeful that redrafting institutional policies and defining spousal positions will empower women in academics.For Lovett, the insurmountable grey area surrounding this case could be alleviated by crafting a proper outline of the spousal position at post-secondary levels. “Going forward, I think it’s going to be wise all around to pay much more attention to the role of the spouse and define it in a way that is not done now,” Lovett said. “If the institution expects the spouse to have a role and contribute to the institution, something ought to be negotiated and defined before a presidential contract is signed.” The grey area is common, according to Lovett, especially in scenarios like this. Scandals and resignations may be more salient, but “behind the scenes there are lots of tensions.”However, perhaps there need not be a spousal definition if there aren’t separate expectations for women. Robert stated the importance of cultivating a “new frontier” that would take a look at the gender identities that shape educational institutions, which would dive deep into the official policies that universities strive to uphold.“It’s not enough to put women in power; it’s not enough to put people of color in positions of power, because there is something called an institution with a very strong history,” she said. “And with educational institutions, specifically, one thing that the research shows is that we’re very slow to change. It is a very static institution that is very difficult to transform. But, it can change.” Update Feb. 22: Clara Lovett was president of Northern Arizona University, not Northern Arizona State University.

According to the lawsuit, when Keri Anne Connaughty of Wausau went to UW plastic surgeon John Siebert for a tummy tuck and breast augmentation surgery she did not receive the correct implant size because Siebert disregarded her request. She said Siebert implanted silicone breast implants that were 350-375 cubic centimeters when she had asked for implants that were 225-250 cubic centimeters. When Connaughty experienced discomfort after the surgery, including pain, swelling and bleeding of the abdomen, she said she returned to Siebert for help. However, when she arrived to her appointment, she alleged that Siebert inappropriately touched her shoulders and bare legs, seemingly trying to console her as she cried from the pain of her abdomen wound. In the lawsuit, Connaughty also said Siebert called her “babe” and “sweetie”, names which made her feel uncomfortable. Connaughty, a mother of three, said by filing the lawsuit she is “advocating for others so no one has to experience what I did.” Before working at UW Health Transformations, Siebert was involved with a sexual misconduct case in New York, where he was found guilty of having a sexual relationship with one of his patients. UW Health spokeswoman Lisa Brunette said they do not comment on pending litigation, but said Siebert has provided ""invaluable care to patients"" during his time at the hospital.

They need to get this done before Mitch McConnell’s face melts off of his skull completely, so naturally the White House put out a list of potential Supreme Court nominees before the body even turned cold. As the Daily Cardinal Almanac’s Chief Political Analyst, I will break down the odds for some of the most prominent names of possible replacements for Ginsburg’s seat:Not likely, but I could definitely see this one. Trump owes Cruz a favor for handing him the Republican nomination in 2016 by being one of the most repugnant doofuses on the planet. This choice would also be a historic step forward for Twitter-stepdaughter-porn-watchers.Also a longshot. With that being said, Cotton is quickly becoming a rising star among Republicans after the New York Times published his June 3 op-ed proposing that the U.S. military be sent in to deal with — and presumably shoot — protesters in the wake of the murder of George Floyd.Hawley has already pledged to try to help overturn Roe v. Wade, but he wouldn’t be able to be the next president after Trump’s second term if he was on the Supreme Court.Now for the real contenders, Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa. I believe Trump will choose a woman for two reasons: it will take ammo — in the form of charges of sexism — away from Sleepy Joe and Phony Kamala, and it will significantly decrease the chances that the nomination process is slowed or marred by pesky allegations of sexual misconduct.Uber-popular with the Christian right, Barrett’s record and ideals are so conventionally insane for the Christian right that there is basically nothing original to make fun of her for. She would almost be an even more uninteresting character than fellow Indianan Mike Pence if it weren’t for the fact that she has seven (7!) kids.  Certain to be a favorite among galaxy-brain political consultants who believe Floridians’ votes will be won or lost based on whether or not the next nominee for the Supreme Court is from Florida — when the truth is that Trump will win Florida because he is friends with Tom Brady. So to wrap things up, expect the next nominee for the Supreme Court to be one of these two birds, and expect her to be installed before RBG’s funeral procession is over.",Trump’s supreme court contenders: a review,UWM

UW-La Crosse released a pair of reports from the November investigation Wednesday, the second of which concluded Elgin sexually harassed student Caycee Bean in 2015, who previously made her allegations public in a September Facebook post. The harassment took place during a private drawing lesson, and the investigation reported similar incidents involving other students over the course of Elgin’s career. Elgin announced his retirement in December rather than risk his benefits, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. He has denied wrongdoing and questioned the integrity of the investigation in a letter from his attorney.  Bean shared her experience with Elgin online after she received what she considered a disappointing response from the university to her initial complaint. Soon after, UW-La Crosse reopened the investigation into Elgin. The InvestigationThe investigation described how Elgin allowed Bean into an advanced art class he taught, waiving the prerequisite. When Bean expressed to Elgin her drawing skills were not as advanced as others, he offered her drawing tutorials, which Bean said she didn’t realize would be private.During the private drawing lesson, Elgin sketched while Bean modeled in a small room. He asked her to remove the sweater she wore over a tank top, made comments on her body and tried to lift her shirt twice, according to the report. Elgin said he does not recall meeting with Bean in the small room she said the harassment occurred, the report said.However, investigators also interviewed one current and three former students of Elgin’s with comparable stories. A student who began her time at the university in 2013 cited a private drawing lesson with Elgin, which ended when he “put his hands around her waist (caressing her) and told her how beautiful her body is,” the report said. Similarly, another student who started at UW-La Crosse in 2005 detailed separate incidents in which Elgin asked her to remove her underwear, her robe or her shirt, the final incident including his explanation of “the need to know where nipples are when trying to understand the relationship of the different parts of the body,” the investigation said. Like Bean, she mentioned private drawing tutorials and said Elgin allowed her to enroll in an advanced art class as a freshman. Statements from several UW-La Crosse art professors included in the investigation said waiving class prerequisites happens often. The report found Elgin recommended 314 waivers between fall 2015 and fall 2019, including female and male students.The investigation also detailed two students’ experience “auditioning” to be paid models for the art department in 2016. The two students’ modeling “practice session” involved Elgin convincing the women to expose their breasts, and he took photos of them, according to investigators. One of the students decided not to model for art classes, but the other did. She described classroom modeling and the “practice session” as vastly different.“In the classroom setting, everything about nude modeling was highly professional ... The students are not allowed to film, take photos, or make any sorts of comments about the models or their bodies,” the student told investigators. “I feel incredibly humiliated and violated by the first encounter that I had with Joel [Elgin]. The ‘practice session’ that he created for us clearly was not what we thought it was.”ResponsesThe five-page letter from Elgin’s attorney responding to the investigation called it “not an impartial document” and accused investigators of selectively including information. The letter defended Elgin’s character, citing teaching accolades, his Rate My Professor numbers and the fact that his personal file “contains no complaints.”The letter provided explanations for some of Elgin’s behavior described in the report and denied the rest. His background as a figure artist explained how “a discussion of the body is a requirement of the method and not a sexual comment,” according to the letter. The letter questioned the accounts by the other students, calling them “obviously spawned by the Facebook frenzy.” It objected to many details about the room where the alleged incidents took place — its size, whether it has a lock — in Bean and the other students’ testimonies and called one part of the 2005 student’s account “a coached statement.”In an interview with WPR, Bean pushed back against this characterization of the other students' accounts as part of a larger campaign to “cancel” Elgin.“These girls aren’t my minions, like, I do not know these women,” Bean told WPR. “These are complete strangers who have just heard the word of this guy finally being caught and have a story to share.”At the time of the Dec. 12 interview, Bean said she had no plans to press charges against Elgin. Her attorney has not returned a request for comment for this story. Campus ReactionAccording to Elgin’s attorney’s letter, Bean posting about her experience on Facebook created “a firestorm of hate and bias on campus.” However, not everyone learned about her story through social media.UW-La Crosse senior Kendra Whelan began protesting daily on campus after Bean made her allegations public, holding a sign that read “UWL protects predatory professors.” Whelan said she believes she helped spread awareness, as students would approach her and ask about the sign. When she began protesting, Whelan petitioned for UW-La Crosse Chancellor Joe Gow to hold an open forum about sexual misconduct on campus, and now that has become a reality. Gow and the university’s Title IX team announced an open forum on the Elgin case and “any other issues related to UWL” on Feb. 12.“[T]he release of this report is not the end of this important conversation as a campus community,” Gow said in a campus-wide email Wednesday. “[The forum] will only be the first step towards healing and making the lasting change to ensure that this never happens again.”Whelan agreed the open forum is only the start, saying the university also needs more funding for survivor services and prevention trainings throughout the academic year, not just at the beginning. She is hopefully that administration is moving in the right direction though, saying “Chancellor Gow seems ready to put money where his mouth is,” and she will continue to urge the university in this direction. “I am going to use my last semester here to try to push the administration, faculty and staff, and the student body to do more to combat sexual violence and abuse of power. We can all be doing more,” Whelan said in an email. “The silence has been shattered, and it is our duty to continue this conversation, even after I'm gone.” Whelan also emphasized the bravery of everyone who stepped forward with allegations, and she said she hopes students continue to demand more from their institutions. “I've been saying this whole time that it's more than just this one professor, than this one instance of violence and injustice,” she said.","Investigation reveals former UW-La Crosse professor sexually harassed student, behaved inappropriately with others",UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/12/personhood-wrong-focus-for-state-gop,"December 5, 2011 | 11:16pm CST","Abortion: my favorite thing to watch people bicker about via the comfortable anonymity of the Internet. Discourse in various comment sections and discussion boards has enlightened me to the fact that pro-choice liberals are ""cold-hearted baby-killers,"" while pro-life conservatives are ""soulless misogynistic slavers."" This surprised me, because, I had always thought of liberals as those friendly tree-huggers and conservatives as the freedom lovers.But honestly, such conversation made me realize one thing: Any politically tinged discussion on the issue of abortion is utterly worthless nowadays.Why does this topic have no chance of advancing political debate? Nobody will accept that ‘the other side' has any valid points because both sides have their own respective absolutes: the absolute choice of the woman or the absolute life of the child. Consequently, nothing will be accomplished unless one group has the necessary brute power.But as fruitless and worthless debating abortion may be, the issue will continue to haunt political theater for years to come. In fact, the Wisconsin's legislature brought the issue back in the form of the so-called ‘personhood amendment.' According to the legislative Reference Bureau, ""The constitution states that all people are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, among which is the right to life. This constitutional amendment, proposed to the 2011 legislature on first consideration, replaces the phrase ‘are born equally free and independent' with the phrase ‘are equally free and independent' and defines the terms ‘people' and ‘person' with respect to the right to life to include every human being at any stage of development.""Perhaps the most delightful thing about this proposal is that it was created with the full knowledge that it would get absolutely nowhere. I have to tip my hat to state Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, and state Reps. Andre Jacque, R-Bellevue, Daniel LeMahieu, R-Cascade, Donald Pridemore, R-Hartford, and the bill's other Republican co-sponsors for so courageously putting their names on top of a document that is so blatantly meant to waste the Legislature's time.In fact, I have to commend any male politicians in this country who come up with abortion-related legislation without the participation of even one woman. Who better to come up with laws that strictly regulate the body than those whose bodies will never be affected by them?Male politicians will never have to experience physically the abortion procedure, nor will they ever experience the emotional struggle a woman must face when she considers having an abortion because she has been raped or is too young or physically weak to complete a pregnancy. Therefore, male politicians can easily pretend there are no shades of gray in the morality or necessity of terminating a pregnancy and simply do away with abortion altogether-without being affected in the slightest.Those Republican legislators' disconnect with abortion must also be the reason the change to the constitution is so dangerously imprecise and interpretable.The best example of the bill's vagueness is that it never defines how exactly to interpret the phrase, ""Every human being at any stage of development."" I have to wonder where the starting point for, ""Any stage of development"" really is. Normally, I would assume they are referring to the scientific starting point of the human body-the joining of the sperm cell and the egg-but they're politicians, and I can't expect any sound scientific reasoning from them.This leads me to believe that the personhood bestowed on, ""Every human being at any stage of development"" could eventually apply to the individual sperm or egg. Technically, they each have the potential to form a human and could therefore be considered a human at a very early stage of development. Of course, this is absolutely ridiculous, but this is a vague proposal.In the end, this so-called ""personhood amendment"" is a pointless imitation of the Mississippi's failed attempt at its own constitutional amendment. If politicians are truly pro-life, they should work on improving society by increasing people's access to health care, education and jobs so fewer women feel pressured into having an abortion.That would be some legislation worth working on.Mary Sedarous is a freshman with an undeclared major.

In 2006, her book describing a Honduran child's struggle to reach his mother in the U.S., entitled ""Enrique's Journey,"" became a national best seller.This year, the UW chose ""Enrique's Journey"" for the university's Go Big Read program.Nazario spoke with the Daily Cardinal about her experience escaping gangsters atop freight trains when tracing the unpredictable journey thousands of young immigrants make to the U.S. each year.THE DAILY CARDINAL: Can you tell me some of the difficulties you faced while working on the book?NAZARIO: The first difficulty was that I thought I'd start with a boy in Central America and follow him through Mexico, but I realized that was not possible. There were too many people trying to kill this kid along the way-bandits, gangsters, etc.-so there was no way that I could stick with one kid if he was running from all these different actors. I decided to find a boy who had made it to northern Mexico...hoping he would make it on to his mom in the U.S., and then reconstruct his journey.I felt like I needed to make the train ride myself to see a lot of those details. I traveled about 1,600 miles and about half of that on top of freight trains. That involved a lot of challenges: Not getting raped; not getting swept off the train by a branch. I had a gangster try to grab me and I had to try to get away from him and leap forward three cars, [where] I begged the conductor to save me from this guy.DC: Do you think your experience on the train was authentic in replicating Enrique's?N: I had six guys with AK-47s [guarding me through Chiapas]. I could still see the gangsters knifing people and robbing them on top of my train, but when they would get too close, the guys with me would fire off rounds into the air warning them to not getcloser.I think it was authentic because I had a real sense of how difficult it was. I returned to my home in Los Angeles with a slight case of Post Traumatic Stress. That said, when the train stopped I would get off and I would pull out my credit card, have a few tacos and go to sleep in a real bed. I think my experiences were authentic enough...that it allowed me to write about this in a different way.DC: Why did you decide to use Enrique?N: [At first] I was worried that [Enrique] was a little too old-he was 17 [and] he started his journey when he was 16. I decided I'll focus on him, but I'll keep searching for my ideal 15-year-old. Then I...realized [Enrique] was a glue-sniffer, and that bothered me because I thought readers would want someone they could empathize with morethan an older glue-sniffer. [After a couple weeks], I called my editor...and he said, ‘The best characters in literature are not perfect little angels. They're deeply flawed characters because we can't identify with someone who's perfect.' It was at that point that I went with Enrique and...it was a good choice.DC: I read that you were inspired to write this story by your maid who was separated from her son after immigrating to the U.S. How so?N: Carmen came to clean my house twice a month. She had said to me one morning in the kitchen, ‘You seem like a nice person...but it is very unacceptable as a Latina not to have children. ...When are you going to have children?' I didn't want to answer so I said, ‘What about you Carmen, are you thinking about having any more children?' She just started crying in my kitchen and she explained that she had left four children behind in Guatemala. She explained to me that she had come north to work and left them with her grandma, and how she hadn't seen her children in 12 years.It struck me, first of all as a journalist, as an incredible story-this odyssey that these kids make on top of freight trains to come in search of their mothers. But also a very important story...about what is pushing people out of their home country.DC: What do you think the best approach for these women is, who are looking to provide a better life for their family, but don't want to damage them by leaving?N: I insisted that the book be simultaneously published in Spanish because I wanted Latinas to understand...that there were big costs [of leaving their children behind]. In terms of the question, what choice should they make, I can't answer that question after a decade of looking at this.I had heard stories in high school...that the worst thing these kids can do to get back at their mothers for leaving them, is for the girls to have an affair with the mother's [new husband]. I saw [Carmen] two years ago in Iowa: [she] had just learned...that her oldest daughter had had an affair with [her new] husband. [She said], ‘If I knew then what I know now, I would have never left them; this is destroying my family.' I know how the story ends, but I've never been standing in Honduras with hungry children and nothing to give them.DC: How are you hoping this book impacts students who read it?N: I think many people are highly sympathetic [toward illegal immigrants], but I think there's also enormous hostility. I'm hoping that with both extremes, people can start to look at the other side of the issue.I'm hoping that students will read this and it will take them inside one immigrant family and help them better understand the issues of what's pushing people out of their countries.DC: How often do you speak with Enrique?N: I speak with his mother maybe every couple of months, and I spent a night actually sleeping at their house a couple of weeks ago. I probably talk with him about once a year because I think he doesn't want to hear my lecture about drugs. He made himself scarce the night I was there.DC: I read Enrique is struggling with drugs again. Is this information still accurate?N: Yes. During my lecture I'll explain that there is very good news about Enrique and very bad news about Enrique as well. He's still mired in drugs, but the good news I'll save for later.

Over the last year, critics and bloggers have written hundreds of articles, think pieces and columns about the already infamous Los Angeles rap """"family"""" led by Hodgy Beats, Frank Ocean and Tyler the Creator. Admittedly, the glut appeared about six months ago, when the crew finally broke into the mainstream in a very large and boisterous way.By now, many online ‘pop culture'-stalking junkies, having moved on to the greener pastures, may consider the crew old news. Unfortunately, I always tend to bloom a little later than my peers. Though I had heard the name Odd Future kicked around online in the months before its big breakthrough, I had read the reports of the gleefully irreverent bunch of rapping kids passively, intently filing away the information without really ever expecting to need to use it again.I mean, these were a bunch of snot-nosed teenage felons-in-waiting even younger than me. Worse, Tyler and the mind-numbingly talented lyricist Earl Sweatshirt seemed to really, really enjoy sketching out feverish rape fantasies on their respective free online albums. Weirdly, the fixation on rape seemed to be more than a half-accidental running gag concocted after the fact by a bunch of hopped-up, whip-smart high school dickheads.Instead, the group chose to incorporate its morbid fascination with sexual violence into the complex semi-mythic iconography of the group, which also involves a penchant for inverted crosses, pictures of kittens with their eyes erased and dozens of surrealistic anti-social slogans, my favorites being """"F*** Steve Harvey!"""" and """"Swag, Swag, Swag.""""On the track """"Pidgeons,"""" Earl Sweatshirt contributes another faux-revolutionary slogan, which goes, """"F*** rules, skate life, rape, write, repeat twice."""" Of course, one word excepted, a former mall-punk, liberal arts major like me could hardly imagine a more appealing life philosophy. Then again, that word has been from the onset something of a powder keg for Odd Future, attracting a lot of attention and damaging its reputation.But on the other hand, how much has their lack of taste really hurt these kids? Sure, when I first read about Odd Future, I had been immediately repelled by its reputation for cruel misogyny and its tendency to carelessly toss-out hard f-bombs (and I mean the six-letter word, because honestly who cares anymore about the other kind?).I thought to myself, how the hell could anything like that actually catch on with any more than a handful of hateful, weirdo slouches hiding behind their computer monitors? And, perhaps more importantly, why the hell would I ever want to listen to a group with such a clearly distasteful fixation on sexual violence? But then the video for Tyler the Creator's """"Yonkers"""" dropped, and everything changed.I couldn't ignore Tyler any longer, so I watched the video, and there was this aggressive black kid, clearly a former high school nerd, throwing out references to Rugrats, goofing on demonic possession and for some inscrutable reason shouting out """"pregnant gold retrievers.""""Something inside me perked up. It was the same angry, cowardly rebellious impulse that compelled me to publish my underground jokey anarchist ‘zine The Aussie Avenger in high school, the same impulse that compelled me to buy Hank Williams' Greatest Hits and Big Black's Songs About F***ing on the same record store CD run my freshman year. That impulse was going crazy when it first heard """"Yonkers.""""I mean, sure, the """"Yonkers"""" video flirts with a little satanic imagery and a death threat directed towards pretty boy Hawaiian pop singer Bruno Mars, but for a kid just then getting into some of the more hipster-friendly corners of black metal (Burzum, 4eva!), that was really more of a draw than a turn-off. The worse excesses of Tyler's work were notably absent, thus making """"Yonkers"""" the perfect gateway into Odd Future's world.Before you could say """"swag,"""" I was knee-deep in the crazy fun-house mirror Odd Future cosmology, reveling in their lunatic-on-the-lam willingness to give the finger to anyone and everyone, including those who didn't deserve it. Somehow, despite my well-cultivated self-image as a progressive liberal softie, I loved it, and I still love it. So where the hell do I get off getting a kick out of these immature, deliberately button-pushing rants? Why am I in love with what I know I should hate?Do you think Odd Future is totally clean for the public consumption? Is Alex being way too hard on Tyler and the group?

It took 12 years and help from a UW-Madison Law School program to reverse the wrongful conviction.  The program, the Wisconsin Innocence Project, recently received approximately $1 million in grant money, allowing it to continue to help wrongfully convicted inmates like Ochoa.Ochoa would later graduate from Wisconsin's law school and lend his experience to the program. But despite these successes, his road to freedom was not easy.Weeks before Ochoa's arrest, a Pizza Hut waitress was raped and murdered. So when Ochoa, then a 19-year-old honors student, entered the restaurant with his intoxicated roommate, employees immediately went on the alert. Their suspicion increased when Ochoa's roommate asked questions about the murder, leading them to report Ochoa and his roommate to the police.Ochoa remembered the interrogation clearly: """"A Hispanic detective walked in. He slammed his fist on the table and looked at me.  He said, ‘They call me the boogeyman.' He was the bad cop.""""While there was also a """"good cop,"""" Ochoa said neither were on his side.""""[They] said ‘if you know something [about the murder], and you don't tell us, we can charge you with capital murder and you'll get the death penalty,'"""" he said.According to Ochoa, after denying him an attorney, the detectives thoroughly interrogated him. They believed Ochoa's roommate committed the murder and Ochoa was an accomplice, so they encouraged him to confess before his roommate to soften his penalty.After 12 hours, Ochoa said he was desperate to give the cops a satisfactory statement so he could go home.""""When I got [the answer] right or they told me the answer, I just repeated it, and they would stop the recorder, rewind it, and record it,"""" Ochoa recalled.At one point, Ochoa said one of the detectives stopped the tape, stood up and threw a chair at his head.""""And that was the good cop,"""" Ochoa said.According to Ochoa, he was eventually given an attorney who doubted his innocence and advised him to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty.""""It was life in prison or death. Not much of a choice really,"""" Ochoa said.Ochoa pleaded guilty not just to save his own life, but also to relieve the pain it was causing his family, particularly his mother who suffered a stroke after hearing her son could face the death penalty.With a guilty plea from Ochoa and DNA linking him to the murder, Ochoa spent the next 12 years of his life behind bars.While he kept busy pursuing two associate degrees, it was not enough to alleviate the loneliness he experienced.""""One year, it was Christmas Eve and I was waiting for a card to know that somebody still loved me and cared about me. It didn't come,"""" Ochoa said through tears.His luck began to change in 1997 when Ochoa contacted Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project in New York.Scheck sent him a list of affiliated Innocence Projects, including one located in Wisconsin.""""I don't know what prompted me to choose Wisconsin.  I didn't even know where Wisconsin was on a map,"""" Ochoa said.The Project retested the DNA evidence, proving the innocence of both Ochoa and his roommate while identifying the actual murderer.In 2001, Ochoa's sentence was reversed by the same judge who originally convicted him.Ochoa graduated in 2006 from the UW Law School and now practices real estate law while advising on the Wisconsin Innocence Project.Ten years after his release, Ochoa still suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, but said he has been able to find peace in Madison.""""Being a student here ... was my therapy,"""" Ochoa explained.",Wrongly convicted man recalls help from Wis.

A grim future ahead?By: Cathy CecilMaking use of their rediscovered power in allies in government, anti-choice advocates are rallying around the proposed Human Life Amendment, which would outlaw all abortions and state that human life begins at conception.A subtitle for this weekend's [Wisconsin Citizens Concerned for Life] convention reads """"Abortion, Infanticide, Euthanasia—The Need For a Human Life Amendment."""" But despite the seeming concern for human issues other than abortion, the WCCL members are clearly invested only in preventing women from having legal abortions, and to """"bring America back to its common sense and undo the evil brought upon it from social elitists whose values we abhor and reject,"""" according to U.S. Rep. Charles Dougherty, D-Penn., who addressed the convention Friday night.One of the surprises of the debate over the wording of the Human Life Bill and amendment is that no one wants to make exceptions and allow abortions for victims of rape or incest, or women whose lives would be endangered by childbearing.Another target of the wrath of anti-choice leaders is Planned Parenthood, which offers birth control counseling, abortion referrals, and, in a small number of Planned Parenthood clinics, abortions.Planned Parenthood literature attempts to deal with basic questions about birth control and sexuality in a factual, straightforward manner. Many pamphlets answer questions about homosexuality, masturbation, and oral-genital sex.With her voice shaking with anger, [the Rev. Olga] Fairfax pointed to a passage in a book """"Girls and Sex,"""" written by Wardell B. Pomeron, of Kinsey Report note, and recommended by Planned Parenthood. The passage noted that all mammals engage in petting, sex and masturbation. That passage does nothing but promote these activities in young people, Fairfax charged.Fairfax also noted with concern that the book stated sex is a normal expression of love.After complaining righteously that the Supreme Court justices who legalized abortion had no idea of the pain they had caused potential fathers and grandmother who were deprived of children and grandchildren because of abortion, Fairfax wished there was """"retroactive abortion for senile Supreme Court justices.""""Planned Parenthood also came under attack in a workshop entitled """"Planned Parenthood—The Abortion Connection,"""" which featured Michael Schwartz, the public relations director of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. Planned Parenthood is nothing but """"one of the greatest artists at creating euphemism and using words to mean the direct opposite,"""" Schwartz charged.""""[Planned Parenthood] creates a need for its services,"""" Schwartz charged, """"by coercing teenagers into having sex, so they need contraceptives provided by Planned Parenthood, and eventually an abortion, again from Planned Parenthood.""""Convention leaders were divided on how to provide family planning without Planned Parenthood. Some speakers urged development of alternative family planning programs for couples and families, more in conjunction with childbirth facilities.But Dougherty asserted that, """"sex education has been blown out of proportion"""" and urged that teaching values in church and in families would be more useful for young people.There is no need for birth control counseling or extensive sex education in the schools, he said.""""In 1956 I had a good course in biology,"""" noting that such a course, taught by biologists—not sociologists of anthropologists—is sufficient education.Dougherty, too, criticized Planned Parenthood, because it has """"become a vehicle to advance abortion,"""" and because it """"espouses that homosexuality is a legitimate value.""""",Delving into The Daily Cardinal's History,UWM

If no one comes out as a survivor to them, people assume no one they know is. Considering, however, that one in four women will be a victim of rape or attempted rape during her time in college and 32 percent of college students experience dating violence, it seems impossible that someone could not know anyone affected by these acts.Below are the stories of three women who are, in many ways, just like you. They don't have the word """"survivor"""" tattooed on their foreheads, and they don't live a life of exile because of their experiences.

It was like I was watching it all happen from across the room. I didn't tell anyone about the rape for two years.""""When I finally did tell someone, their reaction was anger toward me for not calling the police or telling anyone. The second person I told asked why I would ever let myself get into that situation. It's been four years now and I still struggle to talk about it. If I could tell you one thing you can do for survivors, it is be there for them, believe them and never ever blame them.""""—your fellow Badger""""To my 18-year-old self, a relationship was only abusive if there was physical violence, so it took me a year to grapple with the fact that the guy I considered to be my first love was emotionally abusive.""""We'd dated for nine months prior to my coming to UW.

When I confronted him, the situation somehow became my fault. Because I loved him, I was blind to the reality of our relationship, and thought if I were a little cooler or prettier, he'd value me more.""""Despite my wanting otherwise, we broke up before going to college, but he'd call me and tell me about all the hot girls and his new girlfriend, who was apparently ‘the one.'""""Eventually I cut him out of my life, but the residual emotional effects still linger.""""—your fellow Badger""""I knew him through friends and seen had him around, but we didn't meet until recently.

When we got in his room, I noticed a hole in his door. He told me he punched it the night before while drunk but had no recollection of it.

When we started making out, he tried taking off my skirt, but I said no.A few minutes later, he pushed my underwear aside and put his penis inside me. Upset and afraid, I pushed him out and told him I didn't want to do that, but a minute later he did it again. I felt afraid and violated. I pushed him out again, and unsure of what to do, rolled over and fell asleep.""""I left as quickly as I could in the morning, and as soon as I got outside started crying.

That is the case in this year's race to represent District 8, where Scott Resnick has shown that he is the best person to serve on Madison's Common Council.District 8 is composed almost entirely of students, a group that can often be dismissed in city politics. But as one of Madison's most vital communities, students need somebody on the Common Council who will speak to their interests. As his impressive platform portrays, Resnick is not only in touch with the interests of the District 8 community but is also more than capable of executing his goals.Resnick's proposals are simple but solid. His idea to require landlords to regularly change building access codes is sensible and can improve safety downtown almost immediately. On a larger scale, Resnick's Madison city job fair proposal could help keep UW graduates in Madison, strengthening ties between the city and university while preventing local brain drain.But just as importantly, Resnick is a seasoned city policy wonk. Currently serving as president of the State-Langdon Neighborhood Association, Resnick is a veteran of downtown advocacy. He understands how to work through the labyrinthine city committee system.Also of note, Resnick will be well suited for whatever city government comes out of Tuesday's elections. Whether Paul Soglin or Dave Cieslewicz wins the mayoral election, Resnick's record shows he will be able to work cooperatively with either candidate while continuing to criticize the mayor when necessary.As for Resnick's opponent, former Daily Cardinal writer Kyle Szarzynski, he is more defined by his weaknesses. In terms of ideas, Szarzynski does not have many. His proposal to establish neighborhood police officers is a call for something that already exists. In addition, he has made full funding of the Rape Crisis Center a major focus of his campaign. The importance of the Rape Crisis Center is something all sensible Madisonians can clearly agree on, but city alders have no control over the center's funding—a duty that belongs to a city social services committee.We also have doubts about Szarzynski's abrasiveness. It is one thing to fight wholeheartedly for a subject you believe in, but doing so in a way which alienates all opponents and even potential allies, as Szarzysnki has often done in the past, negates any effectiveness gained through passion. The candidates for District 8 are both very distinct from one another, which makes the decision easy.

There I was, nestled on my couch haphazardly watching the Packers beat the tar out of the Steelers. The first half was nothing special, and the commercials were OK, but about halfway through the show, pandemonium broke. It was like """"Schindler's List,"""" """"Saw"""" and some deranged form of """"Tron"""" all mixed together in one big devastatingly depressing event. I am speaking, of course, about the Black Eyed Peas' halftime show.I don't even know where to begin. I wholeheartedly believe that I'm suffering from some degree of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of viewing that shameful excuse for entertainment.

Fergie's """"singing"""" of the Guns and Roses' hit """"Sweet Child of Mine"""" was not only horrendous, it was downright disrespectful. This, in combination with some sick and twisted form of live auto-tune, a re-hashed electronica-style dance routine, and Usher's brief lip-synch followed by an unnecessary display of the splits truly shows the dire situation facing the mainstream music industry of today.This devastatingly low point in musical form reminds me of something I studied just last semester. I was in a class called the history of music. It's an easy A and is actually pretty interesting stuff, though that is beside the point. The point is, a few hundred years ago there was this point in human history appropriately labeled """"The Dark Ages. In a nutshell, it was a period of time when mankind was basically busy killing each other over religious holy sites, and said """"to hell with art"""" for a few centuries. All creativity essentially ceased to exist and the music scene was probably even worse than it is now. Thankfully, a little thing called the Renaissance took place, and a group of guys banded together and decided to fix the atrocity that was the dismal musical situation of their time. Think of it as a time period equivalent to the 1960s Rock and Roll revolution, just with fewer amplifiers and more violins.Just look at the Billboard Top 100 and you have to agree—we need another Renaissance. It's hard for a guy to even go to the bars anymore without some form or another of audio rape occurring. I have roommates who play this modern day synthesized garbage, and am literally forced to leave the room until the noise pollution stops.If you're like me, and are nearly brought to tears when Ke$ha or Katy Perry comes on the radio, just imagine what it's going to be like in 10 or 20 years. It's a scary thought indeed, and action needs to be taken.Basically, we can sit around and play the denial card, hoping something will change, and we all know how well that worked for Europe when Hitler reared his head. No, someone needs to play the part of Great Britain before we're all turned into the French and are forced to surrender to the underground for good. I don't know how this modern day Renaissance is going to take place, but I do know that there is strength in numbers.There needs to be some sort of coalition formed right here in Madison with one goal—purge the world of all the nonsense that the mainstream music industry is throwing our way in one great musical revival of our time.

His seat will open after Feb. 11.A hearing for the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT) hearing will take place Tuesday.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/11/the-best-of-the-worst-relatable-villains,"November 7, 2012 | 9:32pm CST","Who doesn’t love a good bad guy? Well that sounds weird, but you get what I mean. Or maybe you don’t.Point is, few things are as enjoyable in a good movie as a bad villain. Well not “bad” bad, but really well done and terrifying and easy to hate and awesome. You know, a bad villain.People have spent countless hours debating who the greatest villains in movie history are, and you could make cases for lists and lists of many different fiends of film. However, in my very productively spent hours of reading these arguments, articles and lists, I’ve come to notice a pretty solid trend in which villains tend to be considered the best of the worst. Or the worst of the worst.That is, I’m pretty sure that all truly great movie villains fall into one of two categories, which I refer to as either the “Blank Slate” villain, or the “Magnificent Basterd” villain.Named for the perfect exemplification of the type, the “Magnificent Basterd” villain is one who’s very evil, if not purely irredeemable, but they’re so entertaining and charismatic, so purely fun, that you look forward to their appearance on screen and, in spite of yourself, almost find yourself rooting for them even though they’re a murderer/psychopath/what have you.Its name, at least the way I use it, stems from Christoph Waltz’s character in “Inglourious Basterds,” Colonel Hans Landa, who managed to embody everything that is right and good and awesome about movie villains. He takes the opening scene and turns it into one of the most tense, exhilarating cinematic experiences in recent memory. His character shifts flawlessly from affable and overly polite to icy, inhuman and vicious in the execution of his tasks. It’s a show-stealing scene in a very, very good movie, and from that moment on, he only gets better. As the movie progresses, Col. Landa ranges from borderline goofy (the “that’s a BINGO” line) to a soul-chilling interrogator who commits acts of senseless violence. And through it all, you couldn’t take your eyes off him if you wanted to.It’s not just the great acting and writing behind the character that made him an effective villain though; it’s the fact that even if we can’t agree with what he’s saying or fighting for (and we can’t), we still find ourselves cheering for him just a little. As much as he terrifies and repulses us, there’s a part of us that really wants him to be on screen at all times. It’s this magnetic quality that my favorite charismatic villains like Col. Landa, The Joker in “The Dark Knight,” Nurse Ratched in “One Flew Over The Cukoo’s Nest” and Anton Chighurh in “No Country for Old Men” have all possessed.Sometimes, the villain winds up as the protagonist of the story, as in Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange.” Alex DeLarge’s hobbies include rape, ultraviolence and Beethoven, and yet we’re with him for the entire story and are even pretty much sympathetic to him at the end.This seems like a good spot to clarify something. A villain is a bad person; a hero is a good person. A protagonist is the character we’re experiencing the story with, more or less the main character; an antagonist is the foil to the protagonist, the side of the story we’re set against. You can have a hero as an antagonist, and, as in “A Clockwork Orange” and other works, you can have a villain protagonist.The other category of great villain, the “Blank Slate,” is the menacing, mysterious villain—the one that inspires terror with their mere presence onscreen. Some examples include Darth Vader (kind of obvious), Michael Myers/The Shape from the “Halloween” series, and, very uniquely, HAL-9000 from “2001: A Space Odyssey.” They’re all basically blank slates. If my calling them “Blank Slate” villains didn’t make that clear.Unlike other villains, their appeal lies in what’s left unsaid. Darth Vader, when he first appeared, was a mysterious figure. Nobody knew who or what he was, what he looked like under his helmet or if he was even human. HAL-9000 nearly ran into the same problem, terrifying us in his cool, omniscient and omnipresent sense of menace and mystique. We can’t tell if he’s truly having feelings or if he’s just carrying out his programming, and the closest we get to a physical sense of his existence is that ceaseless, careless, distant red light in a lens. We can’t begin to understand him, and this terrifies us.The ultimate blank Slate, however, remains Michael Myers of the “Halloween” franchise. His motives are left unexplained beyond anything more than pure evil and his face is a literal blank slate, just a white slide onto which we can project our fears.And this is where the true base of the “Blank Slate” villain’s effectiveness lies: They provide a dark, negative space for our imaginations to fill, draw our fears into the open and allow us to fill in the blanks with whatever we choose. It’s our primal fear of the dark being expressed through cinema.This is fundamentally different than the “Basterd.” Where the “Slate” shows our fears outside of ourselves, the “Basterd” scares us by showing us the appeal of being bad, how fun it can seem to be evil. It shows us the monsters that, deep down, live inside all of us, and that they’re really more terrifying than anything we could imagine.Wow, that got kind of serious. Sorry.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/11/tea-partys-extremism-alienates-voters,"November 7, 2012 | 8:41pm CST","I would like to consider myself an independent voter. In truth, I am probably more of a moderate Democrat than an Independent, but I have always disliked labels because most things factoring into them are contingent and malleable. Tuesday, Nov. 6, I was forced to do something that I hope I never have to do again: vote straight democrat. It isn’t that I will never again vote straight Democrat or that I never again want to vote straight Democrat. Rather, I hope with all of my heart that I never again feel it absolutely necessary to do so. In fact, I sincerely want to be able to one day endorse a Republican candidate.Although I am a native Chicagoan, I chose to vote here in Wisconsin because I felt that this fine state needed my vote more than the Land of Lincoln did. And to be fair, there are some Republican candidates in Illinois that, if the timing were right, I would have no problem endorsing. For instance, in what would have been my voting district in the suburbs of Chicago, the district 10, there could very well exist circumstances in which I would whole-heartedly cast my ballot for moderate Republican Robert Dold, who lost to Democrat Brad Schneider by the narrowest of margins. The conditions that I speak of, that I find so dire and pressing to be able to enjoy a moderate Republican in office, are that nowhere, on any ballot, should any Tea Party member have a legitimate chance of success.There have been great Republican politicians in the past, and there still are in the present. Vintage John McCain and Mitt Romney, as well as current Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie immediately come to mind.But the fact is that the Republican Party has been usurped by the Tea Party. That is the reason that John McCain chose Sarah Palin as a running mate four years ago, and it is the reason that Paul Ryan campaigned alongside Mitt Romney. The Tea Party represents a backwards, mendacious and often racist element of extreme right-wing conservativism, and with them holding sway in the government, moderate Republicans have no choice but to at least partially assimilate to Tea Party platforms so that they can simultaneously push their own agendas.I cannot fathom putting more Republicans in office as long as the Tea Party is around. I refuse to allow my country to be dictated by people who could not care less about those who are inherently disadvantaged. I will not stand for anyone who condones, or does not condemn, the belief that rape can be legitimate or that it is the will of God. I will not remain idle while politicians recklessly permit the debt ceiling to near the brink of default, causing an economic catastrophe, just because the extant, mindful propositions to avoid such collapse come from someone who they dislike. And above all else, I understand that it is inevitable that all politicians stretch the truth. But I will take no part in supporting a party that purely fabricates and propagates false data and ideas on a daily basis, with zero regard for any last bit of truth.I genuinely want there to be a time, hopefully in the near future, when I am perfectly content to call Mark Kirk or Chris Christie my president and be confident that bipartisan propositions will be instituted to make the country I love so dearly a better place. That can only happen when the Tea Party is a mere remnant of the past, a blip in the history books. Until then, I must acknowledge that I am so very proud to call Barack Obama the president of my country, the United States of America.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/11/republican-stance-on-abortion-ineffective-and-misguided,"November 2, 2012 | 12:31am CDT","Recent gaffes from Republicans like U.S. Senate Candidate Richard Mourdock, who said that rape is “something that God intended to happen,” have brought the issue of abortion back into the media with less than two weeks before the presidential election.  Former Gov. Mitt Romney, who originally said he would be “delighted” to sign a bill banning all abortions, has softened his stance in an attempt to pander to the women voters he so desperately needs to win the election.  However, Romney still favors defunding organizations like Planned Parenthood and vows to repeal Roe v. Wade (1973) if given the opportunity.A common misconception among conservatives is that being pro-choice makes you pro-abortion. As a pro-choice American, I hope that no mother ever has to abort a child.  However, I do think it is a choice best left between a woman and her body, not the federal government.  In general, I think liberals and conservatives can agree that abortions are something that we should try to reduce.  Conservatives approach this problem in the wrong way. They focus on bans rather than addressing the underlying problems. If we really want to reduce the rate of abortions in America, then we have to address how we will support women in a way that will either allow them to keep their child after becoming pregnant or by providing them with the necessary tools to avoid unwanted pregnancy.       Providing economic security is one of the largest means of support.  In the 1990s, when the economy was roaring, abortion declined at an astonishing rate. But when the economy came screeching to a halt in 2008, abortion rates dramatically increased.  Many of these women who chose abortion during the 2008 recession reported having a traumatic event in their lives, which for many included losing a job or a home. Even more alarming is the fact that nearly 70 percent of women who choose abortion are poor or near poor with more than three out of four women reporting they cannot afford another child. If we truly want to reduce abortion rates in the United States, we have to start by addressing the issue of poverty.  If we can provide economic security, women will be less likely to turn to abortion.Support through education is another way to empower women and reduce the amount of abortions in the U.S.   Often, conservatives are keen to promote abstinence only education in schools.  This policy sounds good in theory, but in reality it is largely ineffective.  Women should be informed of all their options, including contraceptives, which significantly reduce unwanted pregnancy rates and could decrease the amount of abortions.  In addition to empowering women through education, we also need to increase their access to contraceptives.  Thankfully, under the Patient Protection and Affordability Act, insurance companies are now required to provide women with options for free contraceptives.  Therefore, with more women able to receive and use contraceptives, the rate of unwanted pregnancies will likely decline, which may reduce the amount of abortions.I’m always baffled by Republicans who claim to be serious about reducing abortion rates but fail to tackle relevant issues. Simply implementing restrictive legislation banning abortions is neither feasible nor effective. Instead, we must support women economically, empower them through education and provide them with access to contraceptives. That is, of course, if we are truly serious about reducing the rate of abortions.Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Republican stance on abortion ineffective and misguided,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/11/extremists-embarrass-republicans,"October 31, 2012 | 7:56pm CDT","I figure that, with the election coming up in the next week or so, I’d best input my final two cents about the political system. I’m becoming increasingly disturbed by what I see going on in the conservative spectrum of our national discourse. There’s been quite a bit of outrage over some comments made recently by one Richard Mourdock involving rape, which is only another grain of salt in a wound opened up by Todd Akin’s now-infamous “legitimate rape” statement made while defending pro-life positions. So I say to all self-respecting Americans: hasn’t this gone on long enough? Aren’t we sick of our elected representatives spewing pseudoscience as if they were some kind of political medium? The time to end this anti-intellectualism has come, and unless it does end, Americans are going to suffer because of it.I first started to pick up on this trend during the rise of the Tea Party movement way back in 2008. There was a great outcry for a grassroots political movement and a return to America’s “glory days” through simplistic, scaled-back governance. Ok, so I can understand if you’re feeling a bit libertarian, and maybe rolling back certain areas of government intervention would be beneficial, but the rhetoric that was thrown around was disgusting. Climate change and evolution were denounced as hoaxes believed only by the “Libtards” who worshipped Obama. There were constantly calls for the removal of political figures simply for the reason that they were well-educated. This was subsequently done in many states. Well, now their replacements are in office, and America is somehow shocked that these are among the most ignorant and divisive of any politicians to date.Mr. Akin, a tea party favorite, has repeatedly and very publicly stated that he does not think evolution is a scientifically valid theory. This is in addition to his claim that women who are not pregnant can receive abortions. And of course his belief that women can’t get pregnant from rape as long it’s actually rape and she’s not secretly enjoying it. All that would be fine, providing that he’d never occupy a position where he could use his opinions to directly influence people’s lives. Too bad he was elected to a legislative position by people who apparently didn’t care that he believed these things.Similarly, Paul Broun, who sits on the House Science Committee, claimed, among other scientifically invalid things, that the earth is in fact only 9,000 years old. To be clear, he participates in a body that determines vast amounts of scientific governmental policies. This is anti-intellectualism at its worst—or maybe its finest. Simply because he refuses to believe what the scientific establishment has maintained as truth for the past few centuries or so, he is therefore an upstanding, honest man? I’m sorry, but there’s nothing at work here but sheer paranoia over the idea that someone in the government is trying to pull the wool over our eyes. It’s the political equivalent of a raving lunatic running around with a tinfoil hat, screaming at you: “Wake up sheeple! The government’s known aliens have been visiting us for years, man!”Frankly, it’s embarrassing to the more moderate members of the Republican party who don’t think that somehow the “Liberal Elites” are out to get them. Unfortunately, extremism has taken hold of their party, and it won’t go away until someone is brave enough to speak out against it from within the party itself.Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Extremists embarrass Republicans,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/10/odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all-shows-freedom,"October 14, 2012 | 6:40pm CDT","Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All represents a group of about a dozen best friends (eight of whom happen to be rappers and two of whom happen to be singers) based out of the Los Angeles area. You may have heard of their ringleader, Tyler The Creator, otherwise known as “that crazy dude with big ears that ate a cockroach and then killed himself in that really weird music video.” You may also have heard of the group’s quintessential good boy, Frank Ocean, otherwise known as “that one guy who can sing really well and makes cool songs about girls but really he’s gay, I think.” Perhaps the name Earl Sweatshirt rings a bell, commonly known as “that short guy with the disturbingly big lips that went missing for a while and is a ridiculously talented lyricist.”A lot of people associate the name Odd Future with recklessness, anarchy and all around devilishness, and these people are in no way wrong in their assumptions because the group is known to swear a lot at very inappropriate times, vandalize public and private property, smoke copious amounts of weed, blatantly disrespect authority figures and even rap about rape and violence against homosexuals and women. If your grandmother heard you singing some of their lyrics at Sunday dinner, you would scare her right out of her wig.They abide by no rules and throw up lingering middle fingers to any outsider that gives them his or her opinion, whether it be good or bad.Really, it’s no wonder why this enclave leaves a bad taste in the mouths of many. But for me, and hundreds of thousands of people just like me all over the world, Odd Future represents much more than just a group of rowdy young adults that don’t seem to care about anything other than themselves, their music and their money. For me, they represent freedom.By freedom, I mean freedom from the constricting shackles that the opinions of a superficial society have put on our minds and actions. They mean freedom from the mundane traditions of the previous generations, and from any and all doubt in ourselves and our loved ones. When Tyler The Creator created (see what I did there?) the group around 2007, his goal was just to spawn a moniker for his close-knit group of friends to use when they all made music at each other’s houses. The Wolf Gang was initially a clique made up of best friends; it didn’t start as a rap group. Over time, more people were added, much more music was released and their name started to create a bigger buzz.Throughout it all, they did not once compromise a friendship or pretend to be something they weren’t. The members act and make the type of music they want and are now selling out international shows as a result. They’re making their way in this world just by having as much fun as they can within their circle and not letting the opinions or critiques of others affect their course.This is precisely why they’ve been a personal inspiration to me and others around the world. If they were able to make a name for themselves just by doing what they love deeply, there is absolutely no reason why anyone is incapable of doing the same either alone or with friends. Everyone has his or her own particular set of skills that should not be taken (see what I did there?) for granted. If I wholeheartedly enjoy finger painting, then I believe I should be able to do so whenever I want and not care about what anyone has to say. As long as it makes me happy, is there anything else I should be overly concerned with? Granted, that’s a rather caricatured example, but my point remains.Aside from the thematic reasons of why I love Odd Future, I genuinely love listening to their music. I have seen them in concert live twice and those were some of the best live performances I have ever seen. When I saw them on stage, I didn’t see them as rappers or celebrities or gods of modern culture; I saw them as friends. I saw them as people I feel like I have a lot in common with. Then I looked around in the crowd and felt the exact same way about all the people that were surrounding me. Die-hard Wolf Gang fans know the feeling I’m talking about.Odd Future is a cult. It has hundreds of thousands of members and devotees that are willing enough to get the moniker tatted on their skin forever (like me). No one will be drinking any Kool-Aid anytime soon but we may start a mosh pit or walk down the street screaming ""Wolf Gang!"" in unison for no reason.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/10/biden-takes-aim-at-ryan-in-vp-debate,"October 11, 2012 | 11:35pm CDT","Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Janesville, faced off in the first and only vice presidential debate of the 2012 election, engaging in several testy exchanges over their roadmaps for the country.An energetic Biden went on the offensive in the wake of what was widely seen as a poor debate performance from President Barack Obama last week. He often grinned, threw his hands in the air and even interrupted at times when Ryan responded to the moderators’ questions.Ryan was much more reserved but did not hesitate to go back and forth with Biden throughout the lively 90-minute debate moderated by Martha Raddatz of ABC News.The vice president attacked Ryan for comments Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney that the 47 percent of Americans who do not pay income tax “do not take personal responsibility and care for their lives,” which Obama refrained from doing in last Wednesday’s debate.“These people are my mom and dad, the people I grew up with, my neighbors,” Biden said. “They pay more effective tax than Gov. Romney pays in his federal income tax.”Ryan responded by saying a Romney “cares about the 100 percent in this country” and that just about everyone has suffered under the failed leadership of the Obama administration.""The economy is barely limping along,"" Ryan said. “This is not what a real recovery looks like.Ryan also slammed the Obama administration for failing to take adequate steps to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear capabilities and its response to the attack on the American embassy in Lybia last month, which resulted in the death of a U.S. ambassador.""What we are watching on our TV screens in the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy,"" Ryan said.But Biden disregarded many Ryan’s claims about the administration’s actions abroad as falsehoods.“With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey,” Biden said in one of the most memorable lines of the night. “Not a single thing he said is accurate.”As for the war in Afghanistan, Biden was adamant about withdrawing U.S. troops by 2014. Ryan said he agreed generally with that timeline, but said a Romney administration would not publicize a specific date as to avoid tipping of the country’s enemies.When the debate shifted to taxes, Biden appeared to veer slightly from the official campaign line. Obama has pushed for allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire on individuals earning $250,000 or more a year, but Biden said Thursday night he wants an increase in the federal income tax rate from 36 percent to 39.6 percent only on those with an annual income of more than $1 million.Nevertheless, he echoed Obama’s criticism that the GOP would rather see taxes increased on the middle class than the Bush tax cuts expire for the wealthy.""They're holding hostage the middle class tax cut to the super wealthy,"" Biden said.But Ryan said raising taxes on millionaires would negatively affect small businesses that file as individuals. Instead, he advocated for comprehensive tax reform, including lower tax rates across the board and the closing of certain loopholes to avoid adding to the deficit.The two also tussled over the future of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare. Biden claimed Ryan wants to completely overhaul the program and change it to a voucher system, which would require senior to pay more out of their own pocket for health care.Ryan, however, said Obama and Biden gutted $716 billion fro Medicare to help fund the president’s signature domestic achievement his first term in office, the Affordable Care Act, threatening the program’s long-term stability.“They got caught with their hand in the cookie jar turning Medicare into a piggy bank for ObamaCare,” Ryan said.Biden and Ryan, both devoted Catholics, clashed on abortion towards the end of the debate. While he believes life begins at conception, Biden said he does not want to impose his view on others, adding the decision should remain between a woman and her doctor.""I do not believe we have a right to tell other people, women, that we have a right to control their body,"" Biden said.Ryan argued that Obama and Biden are on the extreme end of the debate since their administration supported taxpayer-funded abortions. He said his pro-life position stems not just from his Christian beliefs, but “reason and science,” adding that a Romney administration would oppose all abortions with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.""We don't think that unelected judges should make this decision,"" Ryan said, referring to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortions in the U.S.In their closing statements, Biden re-emphasized that he and Obama have made significant progress despite inheriting a “God-awful circumstance” when sworn into office, while Ryan told those tuning in that they deserve better from their leaders and promised to “re-apply our founding principles” if elected.",Biden takes aim at Ryan in VP debate,UWM

Six million people have died since violence began in 1996, and hundreds of thousands of women have been raped, according to UW-Madison Conflict-Free Campus Initiative campus organizer Katy Johnson.But Johnson said U.S. college students, more than any other demographic, fuel the deadly war by consuming electronics, such as cell phones and computers, which contain these conflict minerals gathered in Congo. “We, without meaning to, play a role in this conflict,” Johnson said. “We are the ones who support these rebel-controlled mines.”Johnson led an informative session Friday to announce CFCI’s plan to join the 100 other U.S. universities in creating student movements that push university administration to pass resolutions urging companies to produce conflict-free products.“UW-Madison has such a legacy of being this progressive, politically active campus,” Johnson said. “This is an incredible opportunity for Madison not only to be a leader in the nation but to be a leader in the Big Ten.”So far, 12 universities have passed resolutions, including Duke and Stanford Universities, according to Johnson.But passing a conflict-free product resolution through a large university is “tricky,” according to Raising Hope for Congo Campaign Manager JD Stier.“[The University] may have political connections, corporate connections and personal investments on the line,” Stier said. “Anything that can cost them or the institution money is something to be scared of.”UW Board of Regent student member Katherine Pointer said if the Regents hesitated to pass the resolution, it would be because of cost.“This is clearly an important issue students are raising,” Pointer said. “But if it comes down to cost and we can’t afford [it], I don’t think the Regents will pursue it.”But according to Stier, the resolution would not cost the university money.“When you are spending your dollars for any consumer of electronics in the world, we should be considering the impact these consumer goods have on the world,” Stier said. “We are asking our universities to put that [consideration] into writing.”But an ocean away, where money is often the least of peoples' worries, Songolo said she found comfort in her family in the Congo.""There were people killed 70 km from where I was staying but you wouldn't have known because I was surrounded by so much happiness and joy,"" Songolo said.

Fall 2012 promises to be just as exciting in terms of political conflict. The items listed below are hot topics to follow as the school year starts.Presidential Election: Wisconsin has been thrust into the spotlight of the presidential election for two reasons: Wisconsin’s status as a “swing state” and Paul Ryan’s vice-presidential bid. Although Obama won Wisconsin in 2008 by almost 14 points, Wisconsin has leaned right since that historic day. Gov. Scott Walker’s recall victory - the first time a governor has faced recall and remained in office - featured a slightly larger margin of victory than his initial election in 2010. The poll numbers from Walker’s election and recall show conservative strength in Wisconsin that the Romney-Ryan ticket hope to exploit come election day. According to recent polls, Obama’s lead over Romney in Wisconsin is minuscule. Although the state only possesses 10 electoral votes, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a large amount of campaigning in the state these next few months.Senatorial Election: The U.S. senatorial race between Tammy Baldwin (D) and Tommy Thompson (R) is already escalating and is sure to be a popular news item especially around Madison. Tommy Thompson is Wisconsin’s longest serving governor and has a strong advantage in early polling; however, Thompson’s history in Wisconsin isn’t all positive. Back in 2000, Thompson chaired a committee which authored the 2000 GOP platform that supported a constitutional amendment banning abortion in all cases including those of incest and rape. Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin’s recent “legitimate rape” remarks have brought women’s rights into a national conversation. Abortion and birth control will feature prominently in the national campaigns and these issues will echo down into this state-wide race.Gun Control: After three shootings received nationwide coverage this summer, gun control and concealed carry issues will definitely attract attention this fall. The three shootings offer disparaging evidence regarding the future of gun control in the United States. Concealed carry advocates will posit the Oak Creek, WI and Aurora, CO shootings as evidence for concealed carry; if one person in either situation had a gun and the presence of mind to use it, a gun owner could’ve saved multiple lives. The empire state building shooting offers contrary evidence. When police officers went to apprehend the shooter, a fire fight broke out where the police officers injured nine passer-bys while killing the shooter. The officers in this case were highly trained handgun users but still caused a large amount of collateral damage. In Wisconsin, a hunting license is enough to receive a concealed carry permit. If trained police officers still have trouble hitting their targets how can a Wisconsinite years removed from his hunter’s safety class be considered a responsible concealed carrier?John Doe Investigation: Walker’s issues didn’t end when he survived the recall election. A John Doe investigation has been circling around Walker’s staff and his actions, specifically the time he spent as the Milwaukee county executive before he won his governorship. The investigation hasn’t created much news since last spring; however, earlier this month it was announced that the scope of the investigation might have grown to include his time as governor, not just the time he spent in Milwaukee county. Any news regarding the John Doe investigation could be damaging to Walker, and the investigations longevity suggests – but does not prove – its importance.Party School Ranking: The University of Wisconsin - Madison fell to 13th in Princeton Review’s new rankings.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/03/no-abortion-coverage-from-federal-healthcare,"March 14, 2012 | 1:59am CDT","The Assembly passed a bill prohibiting the coverage of abortion under the federal healthcare law in Wisconsin following heated debate Tuesday.Bolstered by a Planned Parenthood-sponsored rally that drew hundreds Tuesday morning, many democratic representatives wore pink shirts as they argued fiercely against a Republican-backed bill they said infringed on private healthcare decisions.Republicans strongly defended their bill, which they said prevents taxpayer dollars from funding abortions through President Obama’s federal healthcare law, or “Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act.”“Do the people of Wisconsin approve of the possibility of their tax dollars being used to kill babies?” asked Rep. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, adding he wished the bill went further and fully banned abortion.Democrats countered that the bill oversteps Republicans’ policy of minimum government intervention.“Don’t impose your own personal beliefs on me and my family,” said Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison.Taylor argued not having insurance when a woman feels she must seek an abortion “can make or break a family financially.” She also proposed amendments to mandate, rather than simply allow, insurance providers to cover abortions in cases of rape, incest or when the mother’s life would be endangered by continuing her pregnancy.“I can’t understand this impulse… to control women’s bodies, to control women’s lives,” said Rep. Kelda Roys, D-Madison. “This bill will endanger the health and the autonomy of women… for the most base of political reasons.”Although Democrats, including Roys, disparaged the bill as an extension of the “national war on women,” self-identified pro-life legislator Rep. Joan Ballweg, R-Markesan, disagreed, calling for civil discourse between the two sides.“It’s not a war,” Ballweg said. “It’s what we believe whole-heartedly.”",No abortion coverage from federal healthcare,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/02/student-group-raises-12000-for-child-soldier-prevention,"February 28, 2012 | 2:35am CST"," Children living in the Congo sleep with one eye open in fear of machete-clad rebel soldiers rushing into their homes and kidnapping them to serve as child soldiers. Living in terror of a real life Boogieman, the youth have been coined “night commuters” as they flee to the city where they find safety in numbers. There they find peace, if only for one night.Across the Pacific Ocean, a new UW-Madison student group is working to protect these children. Afforded the stability of campus life, these students lead fundraising efforts to combat rebel armies that violently induct child soldiers in Central Africa. While only 31 students currently belong to the university’s Invisible Children chapter, members raised over $12,000 in their first semester this fall.The group’s parent organization, Invisible Children, is a non-profit organization whose mission is to end the use of child soldiers in Central Africa. Its projects focus on rebuilding communities that the rebel leader Joseph Kony and his Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) have terrorized since 1987.When the nation-wide fall fundraising campaign ended Dec. 14, the UW-Madison team stacked up 19th out of the 2,580 fundraising teams.   In recognition of their success, Marrisa Mora, the UW junior who is leading the initiative, will travel to Uganda this spring to witness the impact of the group’s fundraising efforts.All proceeds earned by the UW team directly finance Invisible Children’s Protection Plan. This project, which targets undermining the LRA’s current onslaught in the Congo, provides rehabilitation centers for former child soldiers. It also supports FM radio broadcasts that warn civilians of advancing LRA rebels.Testimony is key for recruiting both volunteers and donor support to Invisible Children’s campaign. On Oct. 4, Peter King Mwaka, a 32-year-old Ugandan resident, came to campus with three other Invisible Children volunteers to share his story.  “When I was still a little boy, growing up, the LRA came in our village, and in about ten minutes, 31 people were killed,” Mwaka said. “That affected me because I virtually grew up not having any other person beside me.”Mwaka added that while peace eventually returned to Uganda, LRA-based violence has migrated to the Congo, where people continue to be displaced, raped and killed.   “It’s kids that are fighting, kids that are being abducted and kids that are being ignored,” said UW-Madison chapter member Caitlin Bergstrom.Invisible Children Spokesperson Suzanna Hendricks said Invisible Children is now shifting it efforts from fundraising to raising awareness about the LRA.  More specifically, she said the goal of the new “Kony 2012” campaign is to elevate the profile of the war criminal, in hopes of holding him accountable.According to Invisible Children, Kony has forced more than 30,000 children in Central Africa to fight as child soldiers.  But for the last 26 years, the crimes have gone unnoticed.“The hope is that the media and public will pay attention when Kony is apprehended and brought before the International Criminal Court,” Mora said.While the UW chapter also turns its focus to the new campaign, Hendricks said the group continues to find innovative ways to raise money.“They are absolutely rock stars,” she said.","Student group raises $12,000 for child soldier prevention",UWM

""[UHS] has needed to make salary adjustments to continue to be quality health care providers.""After the committee denied Rec Sports and Wisconsin Union's budgets last week because the groups were unable to show exactly where student segregated fees would be spent, committee members asked UHS representatives to show where the fees would go in their budget.SSFC Chair Sarah Neibart said UHS provided the committee with more detail on where segregated fees would go than Rec Sports and the Wisconsin Union did.""Their budget was much more itemized than the Union's or Rec Sports',"" Neibart said. ""At the same time, they knew well in advance.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/11/republican-evolution-still-necessary,"November 21, 2013 | 10:19pm CST","Squish! You might remember that sound. That was the sound of the vanquished Republican Party under the feet of Democrats in last year’s general election. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney—a formidable, moderate candidate who ran on the far right to win his party’s nomination lost to President Barack Obama, failing to win nearly all swing states. This, too, was the case in Congress. Democrats won nearly every important seat in the Senate, like that of Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri, where her opponent famously asserted women’s uteruses have magical powers to undo the pregnancies of rape. They even reigned in Indiana, a state Gov. Romney won, after Sen. Joe Donnelly’s opponent made similar comments about these pregnancies being “a gift from God.” President Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress trounced their Republican opposition despite the intense winds of the economic downturn blowing against them.After sulking around and licking their wounds, Republicans dusted off their Italian-made suits, reshaped their finely designed combovers and did some much needed soul-searching and self-reflection. Looking into their political woes, Republicans discovered something quite strange—political minorities don’t vote for them.Indeed, voting blocs like Hispanics, women and the LGBT community don’t go to the polls for the Republican Party. Upon this realization, Chairman Reince Priebus issued several prescriptions for an ailing Republican Party, each promoting a recurring theme: It’s time for the GOP to reform its extreme social ideology and rein in its members who refuse. Among other things, Priebus called for his colleagues in government to support comprehensive immigration reform, welcome the gay community and put an end to their “biologically stupid” comments to mitigate their vote share problems. To push the party in that direction, he also called for a more controlled primary process so that leaders don’t need to run so far right to win the votes of primary goers. Yet after a year of legislating and an election cycle later, GOP leaders aren’t drinking the slightly less distasteful Kool-Aid. Instead, Republicans remain the gauche party they’re known to be.Their first misstep: immigration reform. After much compromise, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill this summer: a bill that’s protective of our borders and holds illegal immigrants accountable while giving those who want to be Americans a pathway to get there. The bill, which could be an overnight political remedy for Republicans, sits at the desk of Speaker John Boehner, who has promised the House won’t vote on it this year.Their second misstep: women. House Republicans passed a 20-week abortion ban this summer, and Sen. Lindsey Graham has finally taken up the bill in the Senate. Further, Republican state legislatures, like that of Wisconsin, have pushed through other restrictive abortion bills, worsening the pervasive gender gap Democrats own.The third: the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. While Democrats in the Senate, with the help of several moderate Republicans, passed a bill making it illegal to discriminate against LGBT employees, it remains a nonstarter in the House, just like immigration reform. While their comments to the community are less intolerant than they were 10 years ago, their actions toward LGBT people remain as archaic as ever.Despite the party’s unwise maneuvers, moderate Republicans claim to have found a beacon of hope—a light of unearthly guidance—in Gov. Chris Christie. A maverick, charismatic figure, Christie is a political miracle: a centrist GOP governor of a blue state who just won a landslide re-election against his Democratic opponent. But while certain Republicans believe Christie can be the party healer, their next presidential nominee, and even the next occupant of the White House, their hopes may be tarnished over the next year. Much to their dismay, Christie is set to become the next chairman of the Republican Governors’ Association where his primary responsibility will be to campaign for his GOP counterparts across the nation. Doing so will force him further to the right when he has to defend the policies of figures like Gov. Rick Scott and our own Gov. Scott Walker. His association with these policies—like controversial voter ID laws and failure to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act—could forever taint his centrism in the eyes of the electorate and ruin his presidential ambitions—just like Gov. Romney. Alas, the Republican identity crisis continues while a new party fails to emerge. With looming budget fights and midterm elections, it’s clear 2014 will be a crucial year for Republicans to promote their brand for 2016. Will they promote party discipline? Will the House and their extreme counterparts move toward the center? It all comes down to one question: Do they want to win? Ultimately, that’s what the GOP has yet to answer correctly.Do you think the Republican Party can survive without changing their traditional viewpoints? Is Sean accurate with his description of the GOP? Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Republican evolution still necessary,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/11/feminism-stands-for-gender-equality,"November 12, 2013 | 1:05am CST","Feminism takes a lot of heat. It is a stigmatized word. Celebrities like Taylor Swift and Katy Perry refused to call themselves feminists. Even Beyoncé does not consider herself a feminist. I think the word feminist, like the term rape culture, has connotations that are warped from any recognizable definition. I am here to set the record straight. Feminism is nothing more and nothing less than the desire for equal rights and opportunities for men and women. It is about humanity, not hatred. Anyone calling their hatred for men “feminism” should probably just take a vow of silence. If you hate men, that is a personal problem, not a political stance. So stop using the word that way, and stop hating feminists because of it.That said, I consider myself a feminist, and I notice when there are no lead female characters in a movie. I notice when my male boss is more lenient with a male coworker than he is with me. But I also notice when men are treated unfairly, and that happens a lot, too. I think my feminist friends, and especially people hating men, need to observe the times they have the upper hand.I notice a lot of things I love to do that men just cannot do without judgment, and I care about that too. So I’ve compiled a bunch of fun things that I would love to see men have the equal opportunity to do.Men are stuck with their appearance. I get to wear make-up, nail polish, push-up bras, heels and dresses that can be constructed to show off whichever body parts I choose while hiding ones I want. Men have shirts, pants and shoes. I can also dye, straighten, curl and style my hair in any way I choose. If I tell you to picture a man with dyed, straightened hair and nail polish a very distinct picture and personality probably comes to mind, and a judgment may or may not accompany it. It might be argued that women are expected to dress up and work harder on their appearance than men, but hey, I have the choice to upgrade my look and I would not give that up. I can cover acne, I can tan, and hide my weird wavy blonde locks under brown hair dye and a straightener. I’m sorry society doesn’t give men the freedom of appearance we women have. That being said, I am insanely jealous of beard-growing abilities.I am allowed to love a lot of things that men are not. I learned recently that men taking selfies looks strange. We have somehow developed a culture in the last decade that makes it effeminate for a man to use something as seemingly gender-neutral as a small digital camera. Just last weekend I saw a high school musical and I could not help but wondering, “Who’s gay?” Men liking musicals, singing, or dancing causes a lot of  oppressive, unnecessary sexuality inquiry, leading me into another restriction.Oftentimes, men feel pressured to pick a horse in our society when it comes to their sexuality. We are coming to terms with titles within the LGBTQ community but few people consider the sexuality continuum yet. We are all on a sexuality spectrum. Some people will date anyone, some prefer men but will also date women...you get the idea. Today it is much more acceptable for a woman to have a “girl crush” or kiss her friend without anyone necessarily labeling her “gay.” A man having any attraction to other men is often considered gay rather than just being along the spectrum.It seems like if a woman is an engineer or a mechanic or loves football she is praised. She is allowed to not care about any of those things. No one judges me for not being able to change a flat tire. Most people understand when I say I do not care about football and that I prefer wine to beer. I have a male friend who constantly pretends to care about football because he does not want to justify his indifference.Gender roles are not about all women loving shopping or all men loving football. There are seven billion men and women on this planet and no one can convince me that common interests coincide with gender roles. Our culture simply has stigmas attached to a lot of behaviors that no one even thinks about. People need to stop thinking in terms of what girls or boys do, and drop the stigma. Be a feminist. Let people do what they want to do.Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Feminism stands for gender equality,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/11/student-services-finance-committee-approves-2015-internal-budget,"November 8, 2013 | 12:49am CST","The Student Services Finance Committee approved the Associated Students of Madison Internal Budget for 2015 Thursday with few changes, including upholding Student Council’s decision to eliminate funding for United States Student Association membership. Student Council eliminated USSA funding last week after members said USSA has not upheld its intended purpose, which is to represent student issues on a local, state and national level, and has been insensitive to groups on campus such as the pro-Israel community by having a policy that proposes to stop foreign aid to Israel.Student Council members Sarah Neibart and Nick Checker addressed SSFC in open forum and both said they hoped SSFC would uphold council’s decision to not fund USSA.SSFC Rep. Elizabeth Olsen motioned to fund USSA $10,000 because she said she felt it was important to fund an organization that advocates for students nationally. Olsen said the organization currently represents over 1.1 million students and said she believes it needs to be part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison because many students on this campus have student loan debt, an issue USSA represents.Rep. Devon Maier said he was opposed to funding USSA because there are other student organizations that have been effective nationally. Maier said USSA conducted a sit-out a few years ago, which he doesn’t see as effective lobbying. Rep. Callen Raveret said he was originally in favor of funding USSA to have a voice for students at the national level, but then began to research USSA and found a lot of negative attitudes toward USSA. He said the number of people who came to Student Council to speak against USSA was “unbelievable.”SSFC voted 4-6-1 to fund USSA. Additionally, SSFC added $6,214 to the Rape Crisis Center line and removed a rider amendment that stated the Green Fund was dependent on ASM bylaw alterations that would have to pass two consecutive council meetings. SSFC Chair David Vines said bylaws will still need to be passed, but they took away the rider to give more incentive to pass the bylaws.Also in the meeting, SSFC voted to minimally fund the Western Martial Arts Society and heard a budget request from the Atheists, Humanists, & Agnostics.During WMAS’s budget hearing Monday, the organization’s Financial Officer Matthew Manes said the group’s direct service is regularly held historical fencing workshops, although the workshops haven’t started yet because the organization wasn’t offered liability insurance until recently.Many SSFC members originally said they were unsure how they would be voting on the group’s budget but most decided to minimally fund the group, saying it has not provided a direct service to students with the funding it currently has.SSFC Vice Chair Ian Malmstadt said the martial arts group has not, and is not currently, spending most of its time providing a direct service, which is a requirement of groups receiving funding from SSFC.“They have not provided a direct service for four months,” Malmstadt said. “So to say that their organization is a direct service is kind of puzzling to me.” According to AHA’s website, the organization’s mission is “to promote the discussion of faith and religion on the UW-Madison campus,” and through their services they aim to educate students on “issues important to the secular community, and encourage the personal development of one’s religious identity.”AHA Outreach Chair Sam Erickson said the budget they are requesting is nearly an 11 percent decrease from their last budget due to salary changes and budget lines they no longer need, like computer software and hardware.AHA will receive their budget decision Monday.",Student Services Finance Committee approves 2015 internal budget,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/11/un-representative-argues-sexual-violence-knows-no-boundaries,"November 7, 2013 | 1:09am CST","United Nations representative Zainab Hawa Bangura gave a lecture Wednesday on sexual violence in times of global conflict, a speech that happened to coincide with a weeklong discussion of rape culture on campus.Bangura ran for president in her home country of Sierra Leone, and also served as a foreign minister. She was appointed to her position as a special envoy on sexual violence in September 2012.Bangura said sexual violence knows no geographical or cultural boundaries, and is an issue that should be addressed locally, nationally and internationally.Bangura stressed the need to discontinue rape as a tactic of war, and spoke in detail of the pain and suffering of families due to sexual violence.“An attack on women isn’t just an attack on an individual,” Bangura said. “It is an attack on their family and the community.”Using vivid descriptions to exemplify the extent of sexual violence and rape in society, such as “When a man is forced to rape his own son at gunpoint, a six-month-old baby is brutally raped, and a 70-year-old woman is frightfully attacked,” Bangura argued these forms of violence are used as strategies to decimate communities during times of war.She said that in certain societies, victims of violence are turned into outcasts, and there is a lower rate of school attendance for fear of experiencing shame. She emphasized the need to transport this shame to the perpetrators by bringing them to justice. In order for this to happen, communities must first see sexual violence as a crime.Bangura said in countries such as Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the police, local militia and invading troops commit rape, which leads to a decreased sense of safety among citizens.The U.N. proposed a six-plan agenda to fight this problem. Some of these goals included protecting civilians—women and girls in particular—from further attacks, mobilizing political leadership to address the issue and enforcing national responsibility.Despite security restrictions in war-torn countries, Bangura has negated governments in order to visit smaller villages and speak with various victims of attacks.

But what you may not know about Friday is that it is also the United Nation’s International Day of The Girl. While it may not seem like these two events have much in common, they do. They both laud the value of education, but do so in different ways.Anyone who goes or went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison is well aware of the benefits of getting an education at an excellent school. That, as we Badgers know, is good as any reason to celebrate. But for the millions of girls the U.N. is recognizing during their International Day of the Girl, an education—even a primary one—is out of the question.For example, last Wednesday, Oct. 9, marked the one-year anniversary of the attempted murder of a 15-year-old Pakistani girl Malala Yousafzai. Taliban assassins gunned her down while she was riding home on her school bus. The reason? She had advocated for women’s rights. Fortunately, she survived and has spent the majority of this last year continuing to advocate for girls’ rights internationally, despite the intense adversity she faces.Yousafzai’s fearlessness demonstrates just how meaningful an education can be. According to an EFA Global Monitoring Report, more than 66 million girls are out of school, a problem that is most evident in developing nations. Instead of going to schools, girls in developing nations are often forced to work at a young age or become child brides. In fact, in the time it takes you to finish this paragraph, roughly 13 girls under the age of 18 have been forced to marry. These conditions lead to more instances of rape, sex trafficking, genital mutilation and death during pregnancy, among many other problems.While these facts may seem devastating, there is hope. It has been proven time and again that educating a girl through secondary school opens up countless doors for them. According a study by Barbara Mensch, Susheela Singh and John Casterline, girls who have been in school for eight years or more are four times less likely to become child brides. Additionally, literate mothers are 50 percent more likely to have children that survive past 5 years old, according to UNESCO.Not convinced? Let money do the talking: The World Bank has reported that for every additional year of education, a girl can earn 20 percent more money during adulthood. The UN contends if 1 percent more of girls in India enrolled in secondary school, the country’s GDP would increase by $5.5 billion.Our organization, She’s the First, recognizes that an education is a marvelous, empowering thing. That’s why our chapter believes Homecoming and the International Day of the Girl can and should be celebrated together this year.So, sometime in between watching the Homecoming parade, singing Varsity with your friends, and celebrating another Wisconsin win, take a moment to reflect on your time at UW-Madison and what it took to get here. Because, in the end, we can all appreciate the value of a great education.She’s the First is dedicated to helping girls in the developing world become the first in their families to graduate from secondary school.She’s the First is an organization promoting education for women around the globe.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/09/parents-tv-council-targets-wrong-shows,"September 25, 2013 | 12:39am CDT","Last week, FX’s hit series “Sons of Anarchy” aired its Season 6 premiere to landmark numbers. Despite what even the creator of the show admitted was a disturbing episode, “Sons of Anarchy” drew in 8.32 million viewers in its 10 p.m. time slot, setting a record for any show on FX. Packed into the hour were guns, rape and other multitudes of gross, sometimes downright squeamish scenes. So it’s no surprise that immediately following the premiere, the Parents Television Council blasted the network and creator for airing such an offensive and insensitive episode. Oh, here we go.For those of you unfamiliar, the Parents Television Council is a group that, according to its website, “works to stem the flow of harmful and negative messages targeted towards children.” After the “Sons of Anarchy” premiere, the PTC took to the media to condemn the show for its depiction of a school shooting, simulated rape and the torture of women. This was all part of the council’s effort to convince Congress to pass a bill that would allow viewers to have a sort of a-la-carte cable bill so they wouldn’t be required to have networks like FX on their subscriptions. This latest whine-fest doled out by the PTC has finally gotten on my last nerve and I’ll tell you exactly why.The PTC has a history of going after shows that it feels display inappropriate or disturbing behavior. It has scorned “Glee” for episodes featuring characters losing their virginity and then later singing about it. More recently it launched an attack against ABC’s “Scandal” for portraying what appeared to be a waterboarding scene as harmful to society’s youth. And I mean let’s face it, isn’t every kid you know just dying to tune in to a drama about politics mixed in with romantic affairs? Not exactly. But they may be tuning in to a show like “SpongeBob SquarePants,” which according to research can be a lot more harmful to kids.The Journal of Pediatrics conducted a study in 2011 proving “that a child’s brain actually changes” after watching “SpongeBob SquarePants” and could lead the brain to develop ADHD-like impulses. The study was broken down like this: 60 pre school-aged children (age 4) were divided into three groups of 20. Group one was shown nine minutes of an educational cartoon. Group two was asked to draw pictures for nine minutes and group three watched nine minutes of “SpongeBob SquarePants.” After each group had completed its activity, researchers tested characteristics such as impulse behavior, cognitive ability and following instructions. Kids who watched “SpongeBob” did about half as well as kids in the other two groups. Researchers concluded that the frequency at which scenes change in the show (about every nine seconds) was too much action for a child whose brain is still in the early stages of cognitive development to handle. While this is all quite intriguing research, you’re probably asking yourself what point I’m trying to get at. Well here it is.The Parents Television Council is so laser-focused on what it believes is behavior on TV that could potentially harm and negatively influence children instead of looking at what really is harming children. Out of the 8.32 million viewers “Sons of Anarchy” got, 5.55 million were in the age range of 18-49, something that the PTC shouldn’t even be concerning itself with. It’s highly doubtful that a child is tuning in at 10 p.m. to catch a glimpse of the bad-ass bikers. However 39 percent of “SpongeBob SquarePants” viewers are between the ages of 2 and 5, and it’s most likely that the parents of those kids are the ones putting that show on.So perhaps the PTC can stop worrying about the content of a show that has a very small chance of actually reaching children, and be more concerned about what has been proven to really harm kids’ brains. Some words of wisdom to the Parents Television Council: Stop worrying about “Sons of Anarchy,” and start worrying about who lives in a pineapple under the sea.Do you think the PTC needs to lay off “Sons of Anarchy”?

In the course, the workshops highlight the Rape Crisis Center, UHS counseling and Domestic Abuse Intervention Services.According to Santi, she would also like to see multiple campus communities to come together to increase awareness and prevention, including men and the LGBT community. However, Santi emphasized the importance of women continuing to support one another.“It’s good to have an overall understanding that we’re all in the same boat as females,” Santi said. “But I would like to see us all come together.”","UW-Madison, PAVE collaboration aims to educate campus on abuse and violence",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/04/mad-men-returns-for-its-sixth-season,"April 11, 2013 | 12:16am CDT","There’s an odd stench in the air at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. No, it’s not the billow of reefer stemming from Don’s creative team. No, that my friends is the debilitating odor of death. The office is no stranger to death, but this season seems a more macabre meditation on mortality.A dreary opening transitions to sunnier skies as Don and Megan relax in the heat of Hawaii. One of my favorite elements of “Mad Men” is how events happen naturally between episodes, with viewers expected to catch up through the show’s conversations. In this vein, it appears Megan has become a soap opera star since her last gig as Beauty in her fairytale TV commercial.Creator Matthew Weiner has stated change is a primary theme this season. Yet early on Don remains static as he mirrors last season’s closing shot, alone at a clouded bar. His blackened silhouette clashes with the pastel paintings while a serviceman, private first class Dinkins, strikes up a conversation. Don indulges him, but there’s an unnerving realization of isolation on his face as the soldier talks of one day being “the man who can’t sleep and talks to strangers.”Betty remains a child. Her regression has become almost uncomfortable. Delighting in the sounds of a violin like a newborn babe, making casual rape references to “spice” things up with her husband, dying her hair on a whim, every action Betty makes seems childish and petulant. I recognize that’s her character, but Betty’s storyline is less palatable than the homeless men’s makeshift goulash.Luckily, Peggy is handling success well across town at her new agency, but her stubborn adherence to Don’s antiquated practices is holding her back from rolling with the times. The consummate professional, she solves her agency’s crisis, but exudes Don’s negativity.Meanwhile, Roger contemplates life’s inevitabilities with a psychiatrist as the creeping smell of death filters into his barren office. Roger’s mother has died, but he can’t bring himself to cry. Roger wished for life experiences to change him. It’s strange how fulfilled wishes can so easily end in disappointment.As Don leaves Grandma Sterling’s funeral after providing the maid with an ever-refreshing pile of vomit, drunken Don interrogates his building’s doorman while Ken and Pete help him to his room.Earlier in the episode, Don nearly saw the man die and sat in a state of utter shock while his new friend, Dr. Rosen, saved his life. He merely wants to know what the man saw when he died. What remains for man when he is entirely alone? When he has reached the pinnacle of existentialism? Don assumes tropical beaches; in reality, it’s probably the darkness of the empty elevator shaft he stared down last season.Don also mistakenly acquired Pfc. Dinkins’ lighter. Every time he tries to dispose of the flame, it winds up back at his side. Don has already stolen one soldier’s identity and he doesn’t want another lingering in his back pocket. The lighter exudes contemplation, but he’d prefer Dinkins remain a drunken soldier rather than a catalyst for reflection.At the office, Don enters the pitch for the Hawaiian hotel he visited, with his “experience” driving the narrative. The ad says Hawaii is the jumping off point, as a man leaves behind his clothes and enters the sea. It’s suicide, yet Don remains blind to its meaning. He’s still lost amidst the rolling sea as Lumberjack Stan explains the suicide is what makes it so great.Don describes how the word “love” has lost its electricity. Hawaii is a jumping off point, a simple search for the spark Megan’s love once provided. Don didn’t start sleeping with Dr. Rosen’s wife because he stopped loving Megan, but because their love stopped meaning as much.Dr. Faye was right; Don only loves the beginning of things. Don gave up the wife he wanted for the life she coveted, and it cheapened their love. Megan’s proclamation of love in costume during last season’s finale now seems as much a fairy tale as any. Happy endings are a fool’s revisionist history; the original tales were grim.What did you think about the new “Mad Men?” Let Adam know at aparis@wisc.edu",‘Mad Men’ returns for its sixth season,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/04/tyler-the-creator-snarls-on-wolf,"April 4, 2013 | 10:57pm CDT","One video of a hanging, several pairs of colorful socks and a Jimmy Fallon back-leap/Mos Def “swag!” yelp later, it appears that Tyler, The Creator has risen from the ashes of underground darling and finally etched his own place into hip-hop with his Odd Future collective waving their upside-down crosses into the sunset.But you only gather about half of that upon first glance at Wolf, his new album: It appears a few hundred thousand in the bank and a four-story house still doesn’t equal a happy Tyler, who is now coping with the drawbacks of his infamy, the sudden passing of his grandmother who was “always bitchin’ about her carpet” on Bastard and the fact that his father still hasn’t called him back. Still, this album is a smooth, depraved ride through the darkest corners of the summertime with a few bigger names on the bill and a few marshmallows to burn.Tyler stated early in the development stages the production was the primetime focus of this album, and by God he wasn’t exaggerating. His cartoony synth-slap sound has taken a very audible upgrade: bigger chord progressions, more strings and an exercise in all of his influences, from the bare-bones, Missy Elliott-sounding twerkability of “Tamale” to the slow soul Erykah Badu-collab “Treehome95.” Wolf sounds precisely like its setting: a subplot from the original universe found in Bastard and Goblin that finds the characters Wolf and Sam at Camp Flog Gnaw finding love (and hate) for the summer. Tyler’s progression provides a lush cohesion that can accompany the darkest of introspection with a smile and a Sunny D in hand.Though Tyler trolled online about the album being god-awful, he sold himself short on the lyricism; he has even more moments of gold since finding his comfort zone and focusing more on conventional song structure. “Bimmer” is an astounding melodic exercise with Frank Ocean background vocals making the song drip. “Answer” is a sincere and personal moment for Tyler wanting his father and grandmother back. “48” is about Tyler dealing drugs and I don’t even give a damn because it’s sonically beautiful and well written and has Nas on it, so it’s an automatic win.Wolf has plenty of ups going for it early, but it also sounds like Tyler’s emulating all his idols throughout, with  varying degrees of success. It is this variance that makes the record “IFHY” work so perfectly since Tyler’s gigantic Pharrell influence is perfectly compatible with… well, Pharrell. But this is the same caveat that makes “Colossus” sound like a Tumblr-era take on Eminem’s “Stan,” no matter how much Tyler would probably deny it.If Tyler’s albums are one thing, they are damn sure long, and Wolf’s 71 minutes follow suit in the same fashion of its predecessoser: some of the songs are in weird places that can kill whatever build-up he was going for. This is initiated by the semi-comeback single “Domo 23,” which ups the ante in energy, but doesn’t truly add to the already-loose narrative other than being a go-dumb song. Also, despite how “Tamale” holds a weird place in my heart, it has no business being the penultimate song before the jarring outro “Lone,” about the last time Tyler saw his grandmother. Also, the “PartyIsn’tOver/Campfire/Bimmer” stitching may work as filler for the campy vibe, but there isn’t much else here to work with for it to be seven minutes long.The primary problem with Wolf arrives when Tyler decides to abandon the new shades of himself he revealed to revel in critic-bashing and how much fans want to suck his dick. I’d expect nothing more from his abrasiveness at this point, but it can certainly wear on the listener to no end. He unloads several responses to criticism on the somber banger “Rusty,” where he bellows: “The fuck am I saying? Tyler’s not even a violent name/I’m ‘bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes/But he rapes women, and spit wrong like he hate dentists/Goddamn menace, 666 and he’s not finished” (it is worth noting that Domo has a show-stealer on this jam and I am proud to see how far he’s come). When Tyler takes too much time to address writers like me as invalid dumbasses who shouldn’t have jobs, it takes away from the awkward gratification he can deliver when he continues to disobey “voices of reason” instead of complaining.Wolf is neither the Grammy-winner Tyler bleeds for (nor even the nominee), but it demonstrates that he is just as much a work-in-progress as his art. Though he has thankfully shed a majority of the rape and assault content rampant in the previous Odd Future catalog, Tyler is still ricocheting between the beauty of his artistry that can come with his newfound focus and the green-masked-rapist-racist of yesteryear that propelled him to his success. When you hear the tiring “Frank-Ocean-is-my-friend-I’m-not-homophobic-but-you’re-a-fag” quips and the typical displeasure with being famous until he sees his bank account, inflated from cat t-shirts, you can see that Tyler’s maturation has not completed yet. But this summertime opus is definitely a level-up on Wolf Haley’s behalf, and watching his progression is a ride we are undeniably tuned to no matter what ALL CAPS antics occur next.Grade: B","Tyler, the Creator snarls on ‘Wolf’",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/03/slut-shaming-a-societal-problem,"March 5, 2013 | 5:09pm CST","Thursday, a column entitled “Try these strategies to get more Badger ladies” ran on this page. Since then, we have received several complaints about it, which have said some of the language used was offensive. After reviewing the article, we realize the column engaged in slut-shaming, albeit unintentionally. We apologize to anyone who may have been offended by the column and regret that its tone and language could be considered negative, as it was not the author’s intention.The views reflected in the column are not held by the writer, editors or The Daily Cardinal. It was an error in the editing process, and we will do everything we can to learn from the experience and ensure it does not happen in the future.The Daily Cardinal has received letters to the editor regarding the column. In place of printing them, we are choosing to respond to the column by shedding light on the issue directly. “Slut-shaming” is a self-explanatory term that can have unintentional consequences when put into action. Calling people “sluts” or “whores,” even as a joke, propagates a culture that accepts rape as inevitable and as a side-effect of being a woman. By saying that “classy” women only hang out in the libraries, or by saying that women who go out to the bars are “slutty,” we are chastising people for doing what makes them happy or allows them to have fun. Additionally, the Thursday  column was giving men advice on finding women to date, explicitly stating that men need to “get more” women, implying that females are items to be “had” or “owned” instead of people.  Think about it: Although it’s wrong, we would never call a guy who stayed in during the weekends and worked at the libraries “classy.” In fact, society might refer to him as “pathetic.” Although it’s wrong, men who cannot keep up with their friends while drinking are often harassed. Some passed-out men have their faces drawn on, or are even feminized or homosexualized, implying that men who cannot drink as much as their friends are “womanly” or “gay.” Let’s think about what we have discussed: Women are taught to be beautiful and dainty, stay in and study, and have a man. Men are taught to be strong and aggressive, “get chicks” and “keep up” when drinking with their friends. Each of the stigmas aligned with men and women are “obligations” in social norms. These behaviors propagate something called “rape culture.” By saying that only “trashy” or “slutty” women drink, we are implying that those women who do go out are “asking for it” just by going out. We also imply that men should take advantage of women because of their affinity for drinking and their alleged need to “score” each time they go out.  However, neither of these norms are true, realistic or healthy for our society. We should never ask a woman why she was assaulted (e.g. “what were you wearing?” or “why were you out so late anyway?”) or ask a man why he “pussied out” of a night of drinking or didn’t “get any.” Each individual should be allowed to make choices independent of their gender and the social pressures that accompany it.None of this was purposely promoted by the writer, but it illustrates how hard we must work to change our attitudes.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/02/mining-bill-divides-northern-wisconsin,"February 3, 2013 | 11:48pm CST","Beautiful waterways and tree-lined landscapes surround declining northern Wisconsin towns that are recently seeing fewer jobs and increased conflict.Northern citizens are split on a recent mining bill proposed earlier this year in the state legislature that would make the permitting process for interested mining companies easier to navigate. Some citizens have pledged unwavering support for the bill as a road to a rejuvenated economy, while others condemn it as a direct attack on the region’s pristine environment.Republican legislators back the bill for the 700-plus jobs it could eventually create if a mine were built, but Democrats are wary, saying it would loosen environmental standards and allow mining companies to pollute northern Wisconsin without consequence.The legislative debate follows a historical trend, according to David Canon, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor.“The Republican Party is going to favor economic concerns over environmental concerns and Democrats would probably be slightly tilted in the other direction,” Canon said.Two citizens directly involved in the contentious debate are Joe Pinardi, the mayor of Hurley, a northern town located near the proposed mine site, and Dylan Jennings, a UW-Madison student whose home is on the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indian Reservation.Both represent sides to an argument that is increasingly being played up among northern citizens, making the debate truly about the people a mine could affect.Jobs, Jobs, JobsPinardi painted a bleak picture of northern living in his interview with The Daily Cardinal. He has lived in the area his whole life, and consequently has seen the boom-to-bust cycle of a mining town that lost its mine.“Back in the days when I was a kid, we had mines like crazy up here,” Pinardi said. “Our population since the mines have closed is less than half of what it used to be.”He said the number of grocery stores in town had decreased from six to one since he was a child. The same happened to barbershops and car dealerships, which were abundant when Pinardi was growing up, but are now nonexistent.But the issue that hit Pinardi hardest was the number of people leaving town to pursue higher education and never coming back. Pinardi said it happens every year with each graduating high school class.“This year’s graduating class was 55. Out of that 55, 40 of them have gone to college right now and will probably never come back here,” Pinardi said.The introduction of a mine would fix these problems and “revitalize” the area, giving younger generations reason to stay, according to Pinardi. He added the mine would also cause a “trickle down” effect, because the mine would provide jobs in the area, allowing people to spend their extra income at commercial outlets in town.“There are only 700 people that would be employed at the mine, but we’re talking 20 to 22 hundred people getting jobs because of it,” Pinardi said. “It’s all because of grocery stores, barber shops and car dealerships.”Tied to the landDylan Jennings also grew up on northern Wisconsin soil, specifically the Bad River Indian Reservation, and he is quick to recognize the need for an economic boost in the area. But he also sees the land as too high a price to pay for job creation.“The big bill pushers and the people who are really trying to get this passed through fail to recognize that when a mine is put into the earth … it affects everything in the surrounding [area],” Jennings said.Jennings’s reservation sits downstream from the proposed mine site, which has led residents to express concern for their native wild rice that grows in water beds fed by the river. The rice, a food staple for the tribe, would be in danger if the water becomes contaminated, Jennings said.“The processes of harvesting and processing that kind of rice are tradition among my people,” Jennings said. “There is no way a mine would not have any effect.”Chippewa Natives and anti-mine citizens are also skeptical of the promise for jobs. The mine would lead to jobs in the short term, but Jennings said he thought the jobs would go to out-of-state engineers instead of northern citizens.“You get your quick buck but … after that, you are left with the same kind of problems you were with,” Jennings said. “Then you have all of this land that was raped of its resources.”Jennings has had a positive experience talking to students on campus about the issue, but he said many are unaware of the true impacts a mine could have or that an issue is even being debated.He said he hopes people will continue to take notice and that he and his tribe will do all they could to oppose the bill.“We would tie ourselves to our land and stand in front of bulldozers and do whatever we can to stop what they want to do,” Jennings said.",Mining bill divides northern Wisconsin,UWM

Council members ultimately approved the allocation.Representative Steven Hughes also made a motion to strike the budget line regarding United States Student Association membership.Hughes said he feels the student advocacy association has not done anything in the past three months to justify ASM’s continued membership, which he said makes the line a waste of money.USSA representative and UW-Madison student Hannah Kinsella described how her role in the association provides a connection between students on campus and national campaigns.Representative Megan Phillips also voiced her thoughts on the importance of USSA membership, saying it promotes a variety of opportunities for students.“This is really the best way we can be engaged at a national level,” Phillips said.The motion to remove USSA’s membership did not pass.In another move, University Affairs Chair John Paetsch motioned to strike the budget line for Finance Committee stipends, an area introduced for the first time in the 2016 budget.Paetsch explained that in the Student Services Finance Committee, stipends were introduced to improve attendance, but he saw no issue with attendance in the Finance Committee.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/gamergate-is-a-damaging-blemish-on-gaming-community,"October 12, 2014 | 10:22pm CDT","A war on the people who have the audacity to make budget-priced or free, independent games that represent characters other than grizzled white dudes has been ongoing since August. Their games push back against the idea that games must be power fantasies, whether the power in place is the ownership of a vehicle worth millions or being an individual assassin striking terror in the hearts of the orcs of Middle Earth. Most, if not all, of these games are pretty easy to acquire, run on your college laptop, and cost $20 or less.This hate campaign goes by the name #GamerGate. The movement was primarily founded in two events; the harassment and revealing of personal information of game developer Zoe Quinn (“Depression Quest”) regarding her supposed impropriety in “attaining press through personal relationships”—which has been debunked, though persists in a “Five Guys, Burgers and Fries” meme you can see perpetuated even in our own State Street location—and an article by games editorialist Leigh Alexander proclaiming the death of the “gamer” identity. The latter led to the creation of the #GamerGate hashtag by Adam Baldwin of the cast of “Firefly.”Some claim that the movement is about the “contempt for the audience” this rejection of the “gamer” identity shows, but it seems to ignore sites like Giant Bomb that decried “gamer” as a marketing term invented in the early 2000s. Instead, it comes after those who entreat game developers and writers to offer experiences to new audiences. Many now claim it’s a movement about “corruption in the games industry,” but it seems to ignore sites that are taking marketing deals from Electronic Arts or Microsoft; rather they are coming after those who dare to publish “social justice oriented” articles that “push an agenda.” The agenda: it would be cool if LGBTQ and nonwhite characters appeared in more games.After the hashtag gained popularity, enterprising influencers rallied angry individuals to launch hate campaigns against, well, most of my Twitter timeline. Every day I’ve watched the writers and designers who inspire me respond to death threats, rape threats, homophobic slurs (+transphobia), racial slurs (primarily toward Asian-Americans), gendered insults (both referring to the promiscuous and the anatomical) and paranoid accusations of “collusion” or “corruption.” Most, though not all, of the victims are women. The aforementioned Quinn, along with feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian, received high-profile attention when harassment got so specific that they fled their homes.A handful of the industry’s best writers have quit in the face of this harassment. The most well-known of these is Jenn Frank, who has been writing Major Games editorial work for the last twelve years. I could name several more, let alone all the people who were not well-read enough to be noticed or those who turned away before getting involved at all. Game developer Phil Fish (“Fez” and one of the subjects of the documentary “Indie Game: The Movie”) is legendary for his standoffishness and ability to throw and take punches; he left the games industry midway through development of his new game.Others have taken a harder stance. Quinn infiltrated the chatrooms where people discussed whether or not they should try to get her to commit suicide. After the first month, she submitted her screencaps, chat logs, documents, and evidence of hacking to the FBI. Sarkeesian, well known for fielding this kind of abuse since the Kickstarter announcing her “Tropes vs Women in Video Games” series launched, gave a talk at XOXO Fest detailing the harassment.The #Gamergate people are losing. Alexander has been chosen to write about the issue for Time Magazine and The Guardian, to introduce the conflict to the general public. They still hammer down dissent; the GaymerX games convention promoting LGBTQ representation announced a stance of “neutrality” towards the issue, legitimizing the movement as another side, out of fear of harassment. They have rectified this and publicized their dissent. Intel pulled advertising from Gamasutra, the host of the “death of the gamer” Alexander article.For those hoping it would calm down soon, The Escapist, a high-profile gaming coverage site, ran interviews last Friday with several noted harassers. One person who complained, developer Brianna Wu, received rape and death threats that included her address, making her the third victim of harassment to flee her home in terror. Most major gaming coverage sites failed to cover the story.Let it be known; this columnist will not tolerate #GamerGate. The group is a hate movement, regardless of its uninformed constituents. Those who have the strength to stand up are heroes, and those who leave will be understood and missed.

The approach helps people in a group format, where group members are given an opportunity to help their companions to overcome problems, as well as solve their own. Community based sociotherapy was first introduced in Rwanda in 2005. The program has been remarkably successful in assisting Rwandans in dealing with the consequences of genocide and war.The group is used as a therapeutic medium to establish trust, confidence and open environments for discussion and peer-support structures. The approach has helped bring many people to recognize their mistakes and ask for forgiveness during the time of the Gacaca courts – transitional justice courts established in 2001 and designed to promote healing after the genocide – in Rwanda and to build up reconciliation and unity in the community.  Applying the approach, the Byumba Anglican Diocese has tirelessly contributed to assisting wounded people in dealing with the psychosocial problems unresolved by the Gacaca courts.Sociotherapy is defined by its practitioners, contributing to the 2008 book “Here We Are,” as having six conditions: Safety: It is necessary to know that the people you look after are safe. Trust: It is necessary for the people in need to trust the individual who can help, because when there is no trust, those in need cannot move forward.Care: People who need help need to understand that there are individuals within the group who are able to take care of them.Respect: People need to know that even after they have shared their problems with the socio-group, they will still have the respect of its members.New rules: These are the rules set up and agreed upon by group members, thus providing a new start for living in harmony.Memory of emotions: The participants have the right to remember what happened to them and to be able to live with these memories, developing what is good and breaking through the bad. Many testimonies on the healing effects of sociotherapy have emerged over the years in Rwanda. Participants have been able to alleviate their trauma by finding a space for sharing their hurting memories and wounded emotions. Raped women have been given the opportunity to talk about what has happened to them in safety with individuals who care. Through this approach, affected Rwandans have been able to move forward and give pardon to their abusers. They have learned to trust others and, as a result, realize that their lives can continue with meaning.  The success and effectiveness of this method can be partially attributed to the fact that group relationships and community life are so integral to the Rwandan people.Program leaders are making efforts to expand this approach to the entire territory of Rwanda. Currently they are working in the four provinces of the country in a consortium with two other organizations. Hopefully, such practices will also spread to additional locations outside of Rwanda where suffering has occurred. Restoring communities and relationships, healing traumas and promoting positive peace within and among communities and nations should be a high priority for all governments around the world.Jean de Dieu Basabose, co-founded and co-directs Shalom Educating for Peace and has more than 10 years of experience in peacebuilding work.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/04/gender-is-an-oppressive-social-construct,"April 27, 2014 | 11:24pm CDT","There was an article circulating on the Inter-webs this past week regarding sexism in our society, which I think warrants some response.A University of Wisconsin-Madison grad student, and my current, wonderful TA, Kelly Fox wrote an editorial response to an article on the notion female privilege entitled “Is My Female Privilege Showing?! An Open Letter to Mark Saunders” for guerillafem.com. In the article she all but denies that any notion of female privilege could possibly exist, and she is wrong to do so. While admittedly she does make some very good points on combating certain specific notions of female privilege, she is wrong to imply that it altogether does not exist. Female privilege exists in a dysfunctional harmony with male privilage. Let me be clear: I am a feminist. I believe the Western world’s adherence to a patriarchal hierarchy is unethical and harmful to our society as a whole. I believe our society must act meaningfully to protect and advance the rights of women. I realize that there is a powerful and complicated societal structure, created in part by all of us, working against women, and that this is a force that we must combat. However, to say that women are the only victims of our patriarchic tendencies is an oversimplification. Men are also harmed by our society’s misconstrued constructions of gender roles.Each and every one of us has a vested interest in combating our society’s oppression. Systems of oppression are complicated, and they work to harm both the oppressor and the oppressed. It is in everyone’s interest to tear these structures down. We don’t need them.Women get the short end of the stick; there is absolutely no doubt. However, in their oppression they are granted certain exclusive privileges. These privileges are sometimes used against them in their oppression. For example, a couple of weekends ago a friend of mine chose to wear a dress that sexualized her, because she felt like being sexy. A man does not have the privilege to do such a thing. There is no way for a male to hyper-sexualize himself and be taken seriously in any normal social setting. This is something everyone should have the privilege to do. This privilege, however, was used against her, as a strange man grabbed her butt. The man clearly had no right to do this, and was grossly overstepping a general doctrine of respect that every human being should have for one another. Perhaps, had he been brought up in a society in which men could be hyper-sexualized, he would have a better understanding of this doctrine of respect.I am not, by any means, denying the existence of male privilege or rape culture. These are two problems that are very real and are clearly much larger than the small privileges that our male-dominated society create for women, however I would argue that they are the product of the same oppressive system of patriarchy. You cannot argue that it is always better to be a man than it is to be a woman, and it would be laughable to suggest the inverse.We should therefore reach an understanding that our social construction of gender roles grants each gender certain privileges and disadvantages and that we should do our best to erode these discrepancies in a general manner that helps women realize true equality.I entirely agree with the feminist cause, but one cannot be a feminist and expect the man to pay for every meal.The entire structure must go. Some small sliver of female privilege does exist, and it works to oppress men in certain (relatively insignificant) ways. Male privilege works to oppress women and is clearly the much bigger issue. These privileges are created by a social construction of gender, which in and of itself works to preserve male dominance. We all have a vested interest in throwing this system out. We should create a system in which one is free to construct their gender-role in any way they see fit, that recognizes the equality of all and that compels us to always treat others with respect. This is a far cry from what we have now, and we all must do our part to dismantle this patriarchal system of oppression.What is your take on female privilege? Do you agree with Spencer that we should get rid of the social construct of gender? Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",Gender is an oppressive social construct,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/04/central-african-genocide-could-be-the-next-rwanda,"April 9, 2014 | 9:03pm CDT","Monday marked the 20th anniversary of one of the world’s most horrific tragedies after World War II—the Rwandan Genocide.On April 7 two decades ago, amid a civil war ravaging the country, the Hutu ethnic majority began its senseless, merciless slaughter of the defenseless Tutsi minority. Though the calamity lasted a mere 100 days, its effects were immediately indelible with over 800,000 innocents executed, completely erased from the face of the earth. Those who were able to outlive the massacre were equally tortured in life. Many women survivors who had been raped during the violence had to endure inevitable deaths after contracting HIV, and many more had to continue living with their friends, family and communities completely eradicated.Certainly, the extremist perpetrators hold the highest culpability for this crime against humanity, and in appropriate response, countries around the world in conjunction with the United Nations constructed the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to seek justice for the victims. However, the international community’s inexplicable inaction during the crisis is almost equally to blame. Indeed, members of the UN Security Council failed to summon the political will for intervention that would have surely alleviated the extremity of the one-sided violence. While insurgents murdered thousands of people at identification checkpoints and systematically destroyed Tutsi communities across the country, world leaders like the United States, quietly evacuated their citizens from the region, ignoring the violence and leaving Rwanda to its fate. Though deploying substantial military would have been difficult and costly, the United States failed to take simple actions, such as jam radio programs inciting more carnage. It wasn’t until mid-May of that year that American officials were even authorized to use the term “genocide” to describe the conflict.But this week—as Rwandans, Americans and citizens of every nation, religion, and ethnicity alike mourn this intense human loss—events unfolding in another African nation, the Central African Republic, indicate we may again be on the verge of witnessing another mass murder similar the Rwandan tragedy 20 years ago. For several months, sectarian violence and civil war have been on the rise between the country’s Muslim and Christian populations. Thousands of bystanders have already been killed, and according to some accounts, nearly one million have been displaced due to the uprising. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon made a trip to the nation Saturday to urge the Security Council to intervene. “The international community failed the people of Rwanda 20 years ago,” he said. “And we are at risk of not doing enough for the people of the C.A.R. today.”Mr. Ban is right. The international community needs to take steps toward intervention, and the United States should be leading it. Too often, rationality and self-interest dominate foreign policy while we give little weight to humanity and benevolence, two seemingly irrational concepts, in the decision-making process. The United States seeks regional stability chiefly to protect its economic and energy interests in the region. Similarly, the United States has taken action against Russia for its incursions in the Ukraine not to restore power to Crimea’s rightful government, but to keep its greatest rival from gaining further political power in the international system. However, the United States has little stake in the conflict in the C.A.R. Little strategic interest exists to intervene.Perhaps this is true—the United States doesn’t have much to gain from taking action against this sort of violence in this small country, yet certainly the United States does have something less tangible to gain from supporting intervention. Inscribed in the centuries-old calligraphy of one of our found documents is that all people have the right to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” the fundamental value that everyone from whatever creed or walk of life deserve a basic, equal starting point upon which they can build their lives. Certainly aimless, untenable killing of thousands of people is a direct violation of that basic principle Americans cherish. As Americans, we have to seek to prevent those abuses at home and abroad. How can we know our own rights will always remain in place unless we know they’re guaranteed to everyone?This week, the Security Council, of which the United States is a member, will take up a resolution to send 12,000 peacekeepers to the C.A.R. to prevent the further spread of violence. American officials, like UN Ambassador Samantha Power, should voice their utmost support for the action to ensure all world citizens can have those sacred, inalienable rights.Do you have any insight on the genocide in the Central African Republic?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/03/house-of-cards-showcases-televisions-cinematic-potential,"March 2, 2014 | 8:46pm CST","Last summer, I holed up in an air-conditioned room and didn’t resurface until I had binged the entire first season of ""House of Cards,"" Netflix’s first successful stab at original programming. The opening scene is still as vivid in my mind today as it was those many months ago—we hear a dog get hit by a car offscreen and an impeccably dressed Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) arrives at the pitiful scene. While wrapping his bare hands around the neck of the whimpering dog, he looks directly at the camera and delivers the first of many monologues in a quaint, southern accent. He squeezes until its cries become faint and, after a few seconds, they cease altogether. We get the sense that Frank Underwood is the epitome of a ruthless pragmatist and a perfect spokesperson for the political underworld.Everything from the cinematography to Spacey’s convincing performance operated in perfect symbiosis to create a sequence and a first season that still resonates to this day. This is cinematic television.The first season culminated in murder, Underwood’s rise in the ranks and a slew of award wins and nominations. Viewers were left reeling, wondering if and how the next season would carry on its scandalous tradition. I have good news, folks—the ascent continues and season 2 is even more praiseworthy than the first.In the first few episodes alone, lives are taken. There is extortion, rape, a threesome worthy of a knee slap and too many lies told to keep count. I won’t give away any spoilers but be prepared to pry your jaw from the floor when it drops.In attempts to keep my promise, I will stray from a traditional plot summary and focus on why season 2, and ""House of Cards"" in general, is so deserving of its acclaim. What makes this such a well-received television show is the simple fact that it doesn’t seem like television at all.In truth, what we have is a political soap opera, which alongside TV as an artistic medium, has been a largely delegitimized genre in the entertainment industry. We’ve all heard the unflattering terms—“boob tube,” “vast wasteland,” “chewing gum for the mind”—well, ""House of Cards"" is in no way a piece of chewing gum. Rather, it better resembles what we have come to expect and admire from classical Hollywood cinema.Even some of Hollywood’s most prominent figures have dabbled in the series’ creation. David Fincher, Jodie Foster and even the show’s own Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) have all lent their artistic services.Similarly, the creators of ""House of Cards"" have cherry-picked a cast of seasoned faces, some of whom are no strangers to the Academy. I was already obsessed with Kevin Spacey even before the premiere of the first episode—Lester Burnham is one of my favorite onscreen anti-heroes— but his portrayal of the ruthless Frank Underwood has undoubtedly confirmed my love. He’s unscrupulous, conniving and a talented manipulator—there were times when even I found myself feeling charmed by his convincing demeanor, that is, until he looked directly at the camera and flashed a devious grin.Just as her character in the show, Robin Wright has proven her ability to hold her own next to a powerhouse like Kevin Spacey. Last season she took home a Golden Globe for her role as Claire, Frank’s equally shameless wife. Season 2 offered her a substantial amount of screentime, allowing her character to blossom into one of the series’ most vital entities. You can almost feel the conflict that bubbles inside of her when she begins to realize that guilt can creep in on even the coldest of souls.Much of the criticism surrounding the series has to do with its simplified depiction of policy-making. I study film, which is to say that I am not quite an expert on international relations, nor do I fully grasp the logistics of how a bill becomes a law. If I wanted to learn such things, I would read a book on political science. I don’t know about you but I have been warned about the precarious nature of “Hollywood history” and I am fully content to use my naivete as an excuse to ignore these concerns.In perfect symmetry, the final scene of season 2 struck me just as forcefully as the first had. Not only was it epic, it felt worthy of a big screen.Think Callie is crazy to love “House of Cards?” Let her know why you think the show may be flawed at ckollenrboic@wisc.edu.",'House of Cards' showcases television's cinematic potential,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/02/letter-to-the-editor-the-truth-shall-set-you-free,"February 25, 2014 | 12:00am CST","Mr. Podgers, the Rose Campaign last Thursday (Feb. 13) was trying to accomplish a good, to challenge a mindset that limits sex to pleasure or an action that is not completely giving of one’s self.  You incorrectly identified the goals of the campaign by Badger Catholic and claimed the idea that the men involved were imposing views on women through the passing out of roses with short notes attached.Commonly, it is men in society today who are promoting a hook-up culture and rape culture against women by using women and women’s bodies for their own satisfaction and pleasure. In some of these cases, women do not have the choice and stop this from happening. The Roses Campaign itself was freely offering a rose and a short message to a woman, who could accept it or deny it, from a man who saw her for being a person, not an object or some lower class citizen.You limit the individual’s own decision making ability by implying that chivalry is an old-fashioned idea and that this way of thinking is inferior. If indeed you believe in choice, you should have no problem with informing people of all ways of thought on a particular subject because everyone has an ability to evaluate an issue and decide how to act based on the information they have. To quote William F. Buckley, Jr., “Liberals claim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are shocked and offended to discover that there are other views.” Mr. Podgers, you claim to be a “liberal Catholic.” Therefore it does not surprise me that you find Badger Catholic’s prerogative challenging. You are misinterpreting the goal of the campaign. Misinformation is a common occurrence in society these days, and you are deluding others of your inaccurate opinion of the Catholic Church, “patriarchal stereotypes,” and “gender roles.”I wish to address your comments with regards to the campaign itself first. Your “assertions” about the Badger Catholic campaign are that men are the only individuals who can define women’s dignity. In no way was this campaign pushing an agenda where men define beauty and dignity of women. Men were given a choice to purchase a rose, write a short note, and hand it off to a random lady of their choosing. As I stated before, the women could accept or deny the rose itself. In fact, some women did decline the rose offered. But as men are the key perpetrators in a culture where women are used for men’s sexual pleasures, the intention of only having men hand out the roses was to demonstrate to women there are men who do not support such a use of women and want to uplift women as persons, not objects. Where in these actions was the implication that “only” men can tell women what is beautiful and from where their dignity is derived? Can one individual man not tell another individual woman that she is beautiful, not remind her of a dignity she poses inherently, and not encourage her in efforts to be proud of being a woman? As I have stated before, information is a good in that it broadens people’s abilities to choose an action corresponding to bringing them a good.Mr. Podgers, I am offended by the fact that you limit Badger Catholic to a single event and limit the Catholic Church to a social progressive mentality. Hundreds of students participated in service trips sponsored by Badger Catholic around the country during Winter Break. The Badger Catholic Service Team goes to the Catholic Multicultural Center in Madison regularly to help serve food to the homeless and needy.Pope Francis has called us to live out the Gospel message, which is a difficult task. He has called the Christian people to unity and to look for ways to unite others. In his Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium, he calls us, you and me, to serve the poor in all ways and bring the Gospel message in peace to others. Evangelization is challenging and showing charity to others in all forms (providing them with shelter, visiting them in the hospital, feeding and clothing them, offering them spiritual direction, comforting them with counsel) is difficult to live out. However, Badger Catholic, through its many efforts, has tried to bring about these things on campus and in the Madison area.Pope Francis also discussed the inherent dignity of the human person. In discussing many ways the Church has helped society understand civil rights, defense of life, responsibility for the environment, and many others facets that have attributed to better unity and peace in society, Pope Francis states, “we find it difficult to make people see that when we raise questions less palatable to public opinion, we are doing so out of fidelity to precisely the same convictions about human dignity and the common good” (Evangelii Gaudium 65). What Pope Francis is saying is that at the core of all these societal matters the Church speaks about is the upholding of all human dignity. We are not imposing a view on other people, but allowing them to see how they are truly valued.He goes on to say that the family, the building block of society, is under attack because marriage is only seen for its “emotional satisfaction.” According to the Catholic Church, marriage is a sacramental commitment by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life and which is ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of offspring. When someone uses marriage and the family for other means or limits marriage to only its emotional facet, it disrespects the union and devalues the other people in the family unit.You stated that there is a lot of beauty in consensual and judge-less sex. My question to you is: where is this found most fully? Without a condom, in the marriage bed, with the option of procreativity, not hindered by artificial or intellectual constraints. At the heart of the sexual act is the free self-giving of the person to the other so that it expresses the unity between the couple and life has the ability to spring from this interaction. The Rose Campaign was trying to provide a view that sees the true beauty and self-gift in the sexual act.Women can make decisions for themselves. Free will has always been held as a good in the Church. But when others start limiting that will by imposing thoughts that do not bring about a good, then we as men must step up and ensure those thoughts are challenged and contemplated to their fullest extent while offering another thought that ensures the dignity of others and highlighting the good that should be sought.Mr. Podgers, we are not perfect. But we must seek the good and uphold the dignity of all others around us. This was the purpose of the campaign and to misspeak about it disrespects all those involved, the givers and the recipients.

Krysten Ritter (“Don’t Trust the B---- in Apartment 23”) gives a heroic performance in an otherwise non-heroic superhero persona as Jones. This role gives Ritter the opportunity to break away from her past experience in comedy, and prove she is a multifaceted actress. “Jessica Jones” is a melting pot of varied emotion and mood, which Ritter seems to perfectly harness. At times the plot can be extremely dark and disturbing, while other times it can be snarky and fun. Ritter proves she is up to the challenge, gracefully playing one of the most graceless, damaged, tormented and complex superheroes on television.Jessica is a superhero who uses her powers to help others, but not in the way you would anticipate. She is a private investigator offering freelance work to clients who are desperate for a snoop. Jessica practices her powers simply to obtain the information she needs for her clients. The show uniquely offers us a superhero with the “super” being an afterthought. Her powers are lower on the show’s importance hierarchy in comparison to her complex character. Here is a superhero that is barely super; she is simply a little stronger than humans, not even by very much. She is still prone to being hurt and even bleeds as easily as any human. One would think this would make the show less interesting but surprisingly it’s only more intense. Her weak powers add physical vulnerability to her already unstable and self-destructive persona. Jessica’s problem is that she is all too willing to help others, but never herself. This results in constant binge drinking and pushing herself into isolation. Her only friend is Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor), a famous radio personality and one of her exclusive support system, along with Luke Cage (Mike Colter), Jessica’s love interest and fellow super.“Jessica Jones” is a superhero show with a fresh take, offering a brand-new plot that comes nowhere near the typical superhero story. We are introduced to Jessica in the midst of her journey to recovery. This is not from alcoholism or addiction, but a form of PTSD caused by her interactions with the treacherous supervillain of the show, Kilgrave, played by David Tennant from “Doctor Who.” Kilgrave has the gift of mind control and uses it abominably. Unlike in other superhero stories, Jessica had fallen prey to his powers earlier and they still haunt her. She is victim to panic attacks, hallucinations and, most of all, guilt after being used as his personal puppet to kill. The show begins with his return into Jessica’s life just as she is trying to move on. Jessica marks his return through cases he strategically placed in her path to weave her back into his web. This forces her to go on a suicide mission to stop him from manipulating anyone else once and for all.Jessica and Kilgrave have a unique superhero-supervillain dynamic. She was the first of his victims to challenge him and escape. This challenge is what sparked his obsession, even love, for her. He gets a thrill from defiance because he is accustomed to getting his way. In his sick mind, she is the one that got away. This brings to light such harsh realities as rape, abuse, post-traumatic stress and more that the show refuses to shy away from. Holistically, it is a series that investigates the investigator. Who truly is Jessica Jones and what has turned her into the chaotic force she is today? This will be answered more literally in the form of her origin story as a child, how she received her powers and why she is suppressing them. However, the focus for the audience, more on the psychological problems in Jessica’s life instead of literal answers, is the show’s true innovation. Jessica Jones is a fascinating character with a fascinating mind, a mind that maniacal mind-controller Kilgrave, let alone the audience, finds puzzling to interpret but captivating all the same.",Marvel’s ‘Jessica Jones’ exceeds expectations on Netflix,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/10/abortion-laws-need-to-consider-the-mother,"October 6, 2015 | 10:44pm CDT","I am a Christian, but I support abortion. As a kid, I was taught to value lives with great care and dignity—any form of taking away lives was forbidden. One example of taking away life is abortion. It certainly is a great deal of torment to watch this helpless life end without having a chance to stand in this world, but it is also a painfully complicated issue for others as well. Because abortion is not all about the death of a baby before birth. It is a great tragedy for all parties involved in the process of conception and process of controlling the fate of the potential life.I am not blatantly devaluing human life by supporting abortion. I merely wish to express how this is not only about taking away one’s life. Indeed a sad reality, not all conceptions happen under reasonably favorable circumstances. For example, in scenes of war, many women are raped and forcibly become mothers of their aggressors. In a letter to the editor by Janet Benshoff, President of Global Justice Center, to the New York Times on May 22, 2015, she reveals some disturbing victimizations of women’s rights during the war, “Largely because of the abortion ban attached to American foreign aid, Nigerian women and girls raped and forcibly impregnated by Boko Haram militants will be denied lifesaving abortions.” This strategy of weakening populations through constant rapes and forceful impregnations is not only implemented by the Boko Haram in Nigeria but across the globe where conflicts are ever so prevalent.It is truly disturbing to learn that human reproduction, which should be used for the strengthening of human race, is instead used to not only abuse individual women’s rights but also is exploited by the forceful, violent conquest of less privileged others. Rape does not happen in battlefields alone—it also happens to many women in developed nations like the United States. Sure, saving a life is a blessing, but would it serve as a true blessing for the mothers who were raped and victimized? Shouldn’t women be given choices to deal with the aftermath of rape other than keeping the baby because its life is important? Should the rights of the baby overrun the rights of the mother?The abuse of human sexuality does not only occur in the confusion by the war, but also in places with relative poverty and unstable social structures. While Latin America is known for its strict adherence to anti-abortion laws, in adoring Catholic faith, it is the place where young girls are forced into unwanted situations of pregnancy.In the May 30 article in The Economist magazine, it is said there are many cases of abuse and little protection to girls to prevent unwanted pregnancies. For example, it was reported that 34 percent of girls suffered sexual abuse before age 18 in Bolivia. The studies also suggested that up to 36 percent of Latin American adult women suffer domestic or sexual violence. Based on the relatively high rates of abuse, it is not a big surprise to find out that many women in these regions suffer from early pregnancies, often unwanted ones. According to United Nations, in Latin America, 69 out of every 1,000 girls aged 15-19 gave birth, a rate that is exceeded only in Sub-Saharan Africa.However, due to the strict anti-abortion laws, many are not given the chance to have abortions from unwanted pregnancies and stuck in the cycle of poverty. In many developing nations, women are not able to engage fully in economic enterprises due to pregnancy and are forced into domesticity in early ages. Because of pregnancies and highly patriarchal societies, these women are not granted chances to be properly educated and have more choices or opportunities to enjoy life as many of us do here. The unwanted pregnancies are likely to create social inequality, deprivation of rights and increased length of living life in poverty. The ban on abortions could also indicate that many people are not provided enough clinical access related to sexual health­—that they would have less knowledge of how to maintain healthy lifestyles during pregnancy or how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases resulting from sexual violence that they often face.Unwanted pregnancy seems to suggest this is not successful in securing the truly genuine path of life. It is ruining the lives of many females—depriving them of chances to better their lives. Also, other than the case of domestic violence, it is true that pregnancies put many women at risk. Pregnancy is a very physically tormenting process to this day, based on certain mortality rates. Also, it puts them at a greater risk in that women suffering from certain illnesses cannot be properly treated, as the fetus can be affected by the treatment.Pregnancy is a potentially happy, but also risky business. All conceptions and circumstances are not always welcoming to the birth of future generations. It is important that as we come to realize how important the human race is, it is also important to consider that all lives matter. Not only the baby’s, but the mothers’ as well. If pregnancies are the result of unfavorable circumstances and victimization of women, shouldn’t we consider a little about how to deal with their tragedies as well, other than losing the life of the baby? We should create a world where both mother and baby could be happy, not the one where both would be deprived of basic rights.Do you agree with Hae Rin’s view on abortion?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/09/with-unrelenting-ignorance-azealia-banks-use-of-faggot-will-cost-her-fans,"September 28, 2015 | 11:30pm CDT","I don’t even know where to begin with my adoration for Azealia Banks’ talent as a rapper. After bursting out in 2011 with “212 (feat. Lazy Jay),” Banks quickly ascended as the “next big female MC.” Her acidic tone, fantastic lyricism and pleasing vulgarity hooked me in as a young college student. With a heavy heart this weekend, I opened iTunes and promptly deleted Banks’ catalogue from my library—what a difference four years makes.Anyone who follows hip-hop, or enjoys the riveting combustion of Twitter feuds, knows that Banks has reigned supreme over the last few years as Queen of the Beef. From collaborators to labels, online commenters to media outlets, if Banks doesn’t like what you’re saying, she’ll come after you for it. Banks has been accused of being transphobic, a rape apologist and a general bigot; these claims came to a head last week when Banks, angry with a male flight attendant who allegedly hit her, called him a “fucking faggot.” Then, lightning struck twice, and Banks lashed out at “white gays” and said how she sees the LGBT community as the new Ku Klux Klan.Now, this isn’t the first time that Banks has thrown around “faggot” as a way to try and push back against “white gays.” Perez Hilton, a bomb-thrower in his own right, received Banks’ ire in early 2013, which culminated in her calling Hilton a “messy faggot.” Banks’ explanation for why she used “faggot” against an openly gay man—which should’ve been the first indication that Banks should be tossed aside—was that she’s reclaiming the word, and using it to describe “men who hate women.” In this recent outburst, Banks defended her usage of the slur again with claims that she has gay men who work for her.Alright, sure. Let’s go with the reclamation aspect of her use of “faggot.” If we are to believe that Banks sincerely wants to reclaim this slur—a slur that isn’t hers to reclaim as a bisexual woman—then fans and observers shouldn’t be shocked that Banks would call a man who allegedly hit her a “faggot.” Since her definition is that it's a word to describe “men who hate women,” that fits.But, and I have to restate this, “faggot” is not hers to reclaim. Has she been around gay men who call each other that, or, hell, even call her that in a joking, friendly manner? Probably. This exposure to the slur doesn’t grant her free usage of the slur, much like a white man who thinks that they can say the N-word because one black man said it would be okay.If Banks has received homophobic attacks in her life, I’m extremely sorry for the pain which she may have gone through because of those attacks.

She’s not being edgy by using a homophobic slur, she’s being homophobic.Banks, in her over-the-top glory, has called out the rampant misogyny and racism still prevalent in the music industry today. She’s had cogent points about Iggy Azalea’s tone-deaf response when asked about “Black Lives Matter,” but recently stated that she “sort of agrees with Trump’s stance on immigration,” because the United States government hasn’t dealt with the stain of slavery. This give-and-take relationship with Banks’ online persona has proved divisive for fans, and makes calling her out difficult. She’ll revert back to calling the “attacker” racist, sexist or misogynist because they’re calling her out when she says something ignorant or bigotedBanks’ reclamation of “faggot” is a joke, as is her continued fight to stay relevant. While her debut album, Broke with Expensive Taste, was eclectic and vibrant, her continued feuds and outbursts are going to alienate even more of her fans. Just because Banks faces bigotry in her personal and professional life doesn’t absolve her sins when she throws out bigoted or ignorant statements.

Pan indicated he will not seek re-election next year, citing a desire to have another student take on the role.“I think it’s the kind of seat you want to hand over to new blood, not the kind of seat that should be used for a career or a stepping stone,” Pan said.  “I’ve always believed that the seat should cycle pretty frequently.”Young said her priorities include a wide array of goals, such as increasing funding for safety resources like the Rape Crisis Center, providing opportunities for affordable housing and protecting the environment.“In my experience on campus, everyone knows someone who has experienced sexual violence, and that’s just unacceptable,” Young said.Despite the challenge of lower turnouts at local elections, Young hopes to introduce voters to their local government.“Many people don’t know who their supervisor is and what they can do for them,” Young said. “I look at this as an opportunity to introduce folks to how local government can impact them.”The election primaries are scheduled for Feb. 16 of next year, with the general election scheduled for April 5.",Recent UW grad declares candidacy for county board seat,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/09/arguments-against-drug-legalization-fail,"September 13, 2015 | 8:38pm CDT","The so-called “War on Drugs” has been a failure ever since it was implemented. Criminalizing the possession and distribution of drugs is contrary to fundamental individual rights, like the right to exercise control over one’s own body and the right to voluntarily trade with others. Additionally, imprisoning people for the use, possession or sale of an illicit drug negatively impacts their life and hampers their freedom. A punishment as severe as imprisonment should be reserved for crimes that have a victim and are clearly immoral—theft, rape, murder and so on. Prohibition of drugs (and alcohol in the 1920s) attempts to purify society and proactively stop drug-related crime before it happens; however, it actually entrenches a black market in which violence is inherently associated with, and does nothing to address, a societal health issue.The most straightforward argument for legalizing all drugs is based upon acknowledging a simple set of rights that all individuals possess. A general rule for encapsulating this set of allowable behavior is that, under normal circumstances, people can do anything as long as they do not harm someone else or their property. Individuals are allowed to take risks with their own lives by making choices about their own health and the dangerous activities they partake in. Whether society thinks a drug is “bad” or not is irrelevant to its legal status. The benefits and consequences of using a drug are subjective. Some people care a lot about health risks, and others not at all. Simply put, all drugs should be legalized because everyone has a right to exercise control over their own body. It is not appropriate to use the force of government (through fines and jail time) because of an inherently personal decision that is somehow “wrong.”Many people agree that individuals have a right to exercise control over their own body; however, they only extend that logic to situations where the health risks are lower than those associated with drugs. These situations could include the right to eat at “unhealthy” fast food restaurants instead of cooking healthy food at home or the right to skydive with the potential for injury or death. Strong drugs like heroin or cocaine supposedly have a risk that is so high that it renders the right to self-ownership and control to not be absolute. If you hold the fundamental belief that it is morally acceptable to fine or jail someone for a personal health choice if it crosses some arbitrary line of risk, there is nothing I can do to convince you.A stronger argument against the legalization of drugs is the idea that certain drugs are going to cause crime. Proponents of this idea see drug prohibition as eliminating a problem at its roots. They contend that drug use causes crime; therefore, preventing drug use prevents harmful crimes like theft, assault and murder. For this argument to be valid, using an illicit drug would have to directly cause another crime 100 percent of the time. I say 100 percent of the time because it isn’t acceptable to imprison a nonviolent personal simply because an activity they do is correlated with another violent one. Fortunately, we’ll never come close to a moral dilemma of a drug causing violence 99 percent of the time because it’s impossible to prove that drugs cause violent and illegal behavior.Human behavior is complex, and there are a multitude of psychological explanations for behavior. Correlation doesn’t imply causation, and even if it did, the correlation between drug use and crime is not strong. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics shows that only 5-7 percent of homicides are drug-related, and only 14 percent of people on probation reported being under the influence of any drug when they committed their crime. Unsurprisingly, 10 percent of the overall probation population reported marijuana as the drug they were high on, so only 4 percent of those surveyed were feeling the effects of a stronger drug. Other drug use and crime statistics consistently show marijuana as the drug most highly correlated with crime, yet marijuana is also one of the most harmless drugs. This relationship would seem to indicate that, even in the presence of horrific anecdotes of violent crimes committed under the influence, drug use does not cause crime. A separate, unknown set of factors likely causes both drug use and crime.While the motives of crime are quite vast and unclear, the ramifications of prohibition are obvious. Individuals who have only allegedly “harmed” themselves see their freedoms eliminated or severely restricted. Just like markets did under the prohibition of alcohol, markets for illicit drugs become black markets that are highly cartelized and marred with violence. Illegal drug users and distributors have no legitimate way of resolving disputes (they can’t go to court or call the police without fear of imprisonment), so they turn to violence. When government authorities threaten their highly profitable operations, they fight back. Evidently, that violence isn’t justified, but there are always people who are willing to corrupt their morals in order to make a profit. Without prohibition, that violence becomes unnecessary and disappears.All of the arguments for prohibition fail. It is not the government’s job to make an individual’s health a societal issue. We all have the right to control our own bodies. Drug use does not cause crime no matter how strong of a correlation between crime and illicit drug use we perceive as a result of anecdotal evidence. People don’t deserve to go to prison for using a drug regardless of the health risks and consequences associated with that drug. Trying to stop the crime problem at its “source” is impossible because there is no cause to hone in on given the inherent complexity of explaining human behavior. All we are doing through our current prohibition policy is negatively impacting people for their own personal choices and setting up a prime environment for gangs and cartels. Like we did in the 1930s with alcohol, it’s time to end prohibition. This time, all drugs must be legalized.Tim is a freshman writer for The Daily Cardinal. What do you think about his perspective?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/09/earning-gender-and-womens-studies-a-seat-at-the-table,"September 10, 2015 | 1:46am CDT","It was the early years of the Women’s Studies Program at UW-Madison, and students in Susan Friedman’s “Images of Women” discussion section were talking about challenges many women in the 1970s may have been struggling with, but could never discuss in an academic setting.“My husband won’t let me come to class until I’ve cleaned the oven,” Friedman remembers one student saying, in response to analyzing an advertisement depicting a similar scene.Such an opportunity to analyze deeply personal and social issues in an academic setting gained formal structure in 1975, when the Women’s Studies Program—becoming the Department of Gender and Women’s Studies in 2008—was born at UW-Madison.“It’s an academic subject. We’re talking about it academically,” said Friedman, who still teaches in the department today. “It’s still a strain in teaching gender and women’s studies. Things that are very personal, sometimes stories of violence, stories of extreme distress enter into the classroom. At the same time ... what we’re doing is an academic enterprise and it needs to be done rigorously ... but you can’t ignore when people come into class and say things.”The GWS Department will be reflecting on its 40-year history and contemplating its future at a campus-wide conference Oct. 23 and 24, when students will be able to hear lectures and join discussions with prominent educators in the field.This department, created by the impetus of roaring social movements, maintained the energy it was born with and now eyes new directions to expand the study of women and gender.Momentum of the ‘Second Wave’In 1975, women made up 51 percent of the United States population, but very few in academia studied their experiences and history.According to Pernille Ipsen, assistant professor and conference organizer, the second-wave feminist movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s helped earn women’s studies a seat at the academic table.“Students were pressing on universities to include many different minority studies,” Ipsen said. “It was so difficult to speak against because it makes very little sense, for, as long as academia had existed, women had been so excluded from the curriculum.”These arguments resonated with the UW System Board of Regents, which in the early 1970s mandated that all System campuses establish Women’s Studies programs.The UW-Madison committee tasked with creating the program wanted the autonomy to establish its own coherent curriculum, but recognized the study of women and gender was missing from many different departments.“We didn’t want to isolate the subject of women’s studies and gender and just do it as a separate thing. We were afraid of a kind of ‘ghetto,’” Friedman said. “We wanted to integrate the existing departments with the kind of issues we believed in.”—Pernille Ipsen, assistant professor and conference organizerAfter its creation, the program faced a new set of issues surrounding its legitimacy. Friedman said skeptics questioned if women’s studies was “just a fad” or “too political.”Faculty seeking to establish legitimacy through tenure in other departments found themselves scattered across the university helping develop women’s studies while also teaching in other fields.Once GWS classes, such as Friedman’s “Images of Women,” did begin, professors faced a new set of challenges, such as teaching a subject that had little academic precedent and even fewer resources.“I didn’t have a syllabus. Everything was so new. I was constructing the class as we went along. There were no textbooks,” Friedman said. “Each week, I’d have to say, was a little stressful.”Stress aside, creating the introductory courses came with its own sets of bureaucratic difficulties.According to Friedman, Ruth Bleier, a medical school professor, first proposed an introductory science course to the Biological Sciences Divisional Committee. Initially, the committee said it was not rigorous enough to give science credit and that “it reads like something that would be in a Kotex box.”Seeking to give the committee what it asked for, Bleier responded by making a course so extremely rigorous the committee turned it down, citing it was too difficult for freshmen.What came from the third proposal has blossomed into one of UW-Madison’s most popular classes: Women and Their Bodies in Health and Disease, more commonly known as GWS 103.Friedman said the course has been “so successful,” and that it regularly enrolls more than 300 students with long waiting lists.The work planted 40 years ago can be seen in a department that is expanding across the board, with more and more students joining GWS and becoming a part of its history.The 21st century of women’s studiesHelen Powling is all too familiar with the waitlist for GWS 103.But to her, the two and a half weeks spent waiting were more than worth it.“The knowledge [a student] will get from GWS 103, you can’t pass it up,” said Powling, a UW-Madison senior. “I learned about my own body and I also learned about myself and my identity. Those two things I will take with me for the rest of my life.”Despite positive feedback on GWS 103 and the department, the pressure to find a job post-graduation leads to many questions about the department’s ability to prepare students for the future.“When students tell their parents they’re studying gender and women’s studies, that can be a hard sell,” Department Chair Judith Houck said. “We joke that many of our students end up working in NGO’s, nonprofits. And certainly that’s true, but our students also become ministers and counselors and physicians and writers. We do well. We teach critical thinking, critical writing, research skills and other things that translate to the market.”At the same time, a GWS degree still offers traditional liberal arts training.“When they watch movies, when they read the news, we’ve given them a way to unpack certain aspects of the world around them—the social world, the political world, the cultural world—that they wouldn’t have known was there until they took our classes,” Houck said.—Helen Powling, UW-Madison studentHouck argues GWS classes expand students’ thinking through offering diverse perspectives, which the department is also actively working on.“There has always been an effort to make sure that we don’t just present the historical perspectives of white middle-class women,” Houck said.Critical analysis, identity and research aside, Powling found other practical implications from her time in GWS 103.“The other thing that will always stick out to me as one of those turning points was the day I learned about orgasms in GWS 103. I had no idea what those were until I was a sophomore in college. I also didn’t know what a clitoris was until I was a sophomore in college,” Powling said. “Both of those things were literally pretty mind-blowing.”In 1975, the Women’s Studies Program was fighting to prove it was a legitimate field. Today, the GWS Department has established itself, leaving students with knowledge that will stay with them past graduation.Generations coming togetherSome women who will be attending the Oct. 23 and 24 conference once lived in a United States where it was not illegal for a husband to rape his wife.All attendees still live in a country where white women make 78 cents to every dollar a man earns, and women of color earn even less.“I was hoping that this event could be a moment to show the students the older generation, as well as bring them together,” Ipsen said. “The issues that we confront and deal with are in many ways the same, but the ways that we do it are sometimes so different that we can’t hear each other across generations.”The conference will also address the future of the GWS Department as resources dwindle.Houck hopes to see future improvements on topics like race, work and the environment, while adding faculty and career planning resources. Friedman said the department is in the exploratory stages of establishing a Ph.D. program, though she noted budget constraints could hinder such progress.“Any lack of resources that we’re confronting at this point I don’t think is unique to gender and women’s studies,” Houck said.Nevertheless, this department builds on its history of thriving in the presence of challenges.It was the energy of advocates pushing for a spot at the academic table that brought the department into existence. It is the energy of professors and students who make GWS 103 an electric environment.That same energy, instead of being used to clean an oven before being able to come to class, is what Ipsen sees the current generation of GWS students using to propel the department’s and students’ accomplishments.“[GWS] won’t keep growing unless we all put energy into it,” Ipsen said. “[The younger generation] should see it as their material, their space to engage in these issues and practice their arguments and their thinking about hierarchies of difference. By having them in the same room ... they can inherit this, take it over and take it as their own.”",Earning gender and women's studies a seat at the table,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/05/athletes-fans-and-social-media-hang-in-delicate-balance,"May 1, 2015 | 1:45pm CDT","In today’s digital society, the relationship between the fan and the athlete has become closer than ever. Social media allows fans to have a more personal relationship with players than ever before. While it’s great to be immersed in the off-the-field lives of our favorite athletes, this increasing connection often does more harm than good.Take for example my beloved St. Louis Blues, who fell in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the third straight year. This pathetic flop by the Cubs of hockey most likely spells the end for the core of this team. Despite their regular season success, it has become evident that this team lacks the ability to perform when it matters. T.J. Oshie will probably be traded. David Backes should lose his captainship and might be sent packing as well. And I’m going to be devastated.But why am I dreading this moment? After all, this is what’s best for the team. The problem is I’ve grown way too close to the players. I follow @OSH74 on twitter, see pictures of his dog and his baby girl and tweets about his life outside the rink. The same goes for Backes and his undying love for rescue dogs.While I can’t deny how cool it is to see what goes on in athletes' personal lives, this relationship is devastating when it comes time for a favorite player to move on. I feel as if I’ve grown close to Oshie and Backes. I’ve admired their in-game play and enjoyed the ability to see their everyday lives through the lens of social media. But all too often, this causes us to forget that sports are a business.Now, as I wait for the Blues general manager to explode the team’s core, I stand between a rock and a hard place. On the one side, I know this is what the team needs if they want to achieve playoff success. On the other hand, I feel as if I’m losing a team I grew up with. For me, these guys ignited a love for hockey and the Blues franchise. Then, because of Twitter, I was able to see Oshie and Backes grow up as men. Oshie had a baby and Backes has one on the way. I don’t want to see these guys in different colored sweaters.But, such is the harsh reality of sports. The end of every player’s tenure with a club is inevitable, whether that be from retirement or a trade or free agency. Unfortunately, when this end comes, the heartbreak of a favorite player leaving is intensified by an athlete’s social media presence.But fans are not the only ones who deal with challenges of a more intimate connection. Athletes can develop strained relationships with fans in this digital age. Players attempt to keep profiles on various social networks in order to interact with fans, but everyone and their brother is a critic and athletes are too often subject to brutal criticism.Brandon Bostick, the infamous Packers tight end, is a perfect example. He made a terrible play in the NFC Championship Game, but does that really warrant fans tweeting death threats at him? And after receiving those threats, how willing is Bostick to continue to engage with fans? Then there’s players like former Giants running back Brandon Jacobs, who received death threats from peeved fantasy football owners. Or Dodgers outfielder Yasiel Puig, who often posts on Instagram, but has to deal with constant hateful comments on his pictures. And who could forget the run-in that former MLB ace Curt Schilling had with fans who thought it was okay to send tweets about raping his daughter?In other words, athletes on social media carry a double-edged sword. They are stuck between wanting to engage with fans and contending with the psychotic ones. On top of that, they have to exercise extreme caution if they want to interact with the harassers in order to avoid a PR nightmare.In the end, I still believe that athletes should attempt to engage with fans via social media. But, with all the crazy spectators out there, I would never blame an athlete for choosing to stay off Twitter or Instagram. As for the fans, it’s important for us to remember that this window into a player’s life is a privilege and we shouldn’t use it to belittle the players we admire.More importantly, we must keep in mind that sports are a cruel business and that just because we know the name of our favorite athlete’s dog, it doesn’t mean he should stay on our team forever. Otherwise, you’ll end up like me, crying into a pillow over T.J. Oshie. Kidding (kinda).","Athletes, fans and social media hang in delicate balance",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/04/uw-madison-group-fights-at-capitol-for-the-wrongly-convicted,"April 8, 2015 | 9:56pm CDT","Representatives from the Wisconsin Innocence Project presented before roughly 40 state legislators and staff members Wednesday, emphasizing the need for law enforcement to wear electronic surveillance devices, as well as a need for an increase in the compensation for Wisconsinites who are wrongly convicted of crimes.The program, which comprises UW-Madison Law School students and faculty, investigates cases to exonerate wrongly convicted individuals by examining DNA evidence and eyewitness testimony. The group has roughly 100 cases open and has exonerated 22 individuals since its inception in 1998.Wisconsin Innocence Project co-founder Keith Findley said wrongful convictions harm all of society.“Every time we convict an innocent person we fail to convict the true perpetrator,” Findley said. “These cases provide a window into the system so we can study what went wrong.”In the case of Chris Ochoa, whose case the program handled, faulty testimony and police misconduct led to Ochoa being forced to admit to the 1988 rape and murder of Nancy DePriest, crimes he did not commit.“[Law enforcement] said if you don’t tell us what you know, you get the death penalty, even if you didn’t [commit the crime],” Ochoa said. “I was scared and I thought I had nowhere to turn.”Ochoa was exonerated in 2002 with help from the Wisconsin Innocence Project and later graduated from the UW-Madison Law School. Findley said electronic surveillance of law enforcement could have helped prevent Ochoa’s original conviction.Handling cases such as Ochoa’s provides practical experience that is rare for students, according to Pat DuBois, a second year law student.“This is an opportunity to do real work for real clients and help someone,” DuBois said. “It is rare for law students to have that opportunity.”The group’s efforts garnered praise from both Democrats and Republicans. State Rep. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, who helped organize the event with state Rep. Gary Hebl, D-Sun Prairie, applauded its work as a way to uphold the integrity of the state’s communities.“[Wrongful convictions] tear apart the fabric of communities and families,” Kooyenga said. “We are grateful that there are dedicated people who are seeking to find these cases and rectify them.”Kooyenga said he is planning to author legislation that would increase compensation for wrongly convicted individuals. The bill would correct a system Findley said is currently the worst in the nation.Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca, D-Kenosha, called the group an embodiment of the Wisconsin Idea.“These kinds of projects are essential,” Barca said after the presentation. “It fits in perfectly with the Wisconsin Idea and upholds Wisconsin values.”",UW-Madison group fights at Capitol for the wrongly convicted,UWM

In the midst of an extremely frustrating, stressful day, the voice of Marina Lambrini Diamandis, accompanied with a simple piano track, filled me with joy. I realized that in the middle of College Library I was sitting alone with a huge smile across my face, as if I had just won a thousand dollars. The simplest track on the album made me remember all over again why I fell in love with music in the first place.Marina and the Diamonds released her third album Froot March 13. The Welsh singer/songwriter has not released any music since her 2012 electropop album Electra Heart. Froot is the result of over three years of writing for Diamandis, and her voice gives her a distinct indie pop sound that has brought her much success. The singer has been known to describe herself as “an indie artist with pop goals.”As I continued on with the album, I found that it primarily consists of upbeat dance tracks.  Diamandis does manage, though, to incorporate interesting and poetic lyrics into her pop sound. For example, the eleventh track, “Savages,” deals with issues of war, rape and indecency in the human race. In addition, the fifth song on the album, “Forget,” has a catchy beat that sounds like a dance anthem in which the lyrics get lost. But in reality, the song has a thoughtful message with well-designed parallels including “Life was like a tipping scale/ Like an abacus I played with/ Counting every win and fail.”In the world of pop music, songs and artists can often seem to sound the exact same. Marina and the Diamonds continues to succeed in her creativity and ability to stand out in a homogenous crowd. The artist has her own sound that is difficult to compare to anyone else. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Froot, but my only regret was that I wish that the album featured more ballads, similar to that of the first track on the album “Happy.” Overall, this was my first time really sitting down and listening to Marina and the Diamonds, but I have no doubt that this will not be my last.

The dignity of working women was attacked on Election Day when the state voted to re-elect a U.S. senator who has voted against pay equity five times. Black students on campus were dehumanized when attendees of a UW-Madison football game brought a noose and metaphorically hung our black president.Our own university has faced losses, with the state legislature cutting $800 million from our budget since 2011, leaving us unable to fund our great research and pay our brilliant faculty.Politically, we are in a devastating position. Conservatives are dominating the government at the national level and in our own state. In January, Republican legislators in the state capital will propose campus carry legislation. This will allow students to carry on their person, into any campus building, classroom or lecture hall, a lethal firearm.However, we have not lost everything. As students, we have the ability to battle for the issues that matter most. We will fight tooth and nail to preserve the integrity of our nation, our state and our institution.I fear if we do not act now and prevent campus carry from being introduced and later passed by the State Assembly, we suffer another grave loss here at UW-Madison.I fear campus carry because my classrooms are politically charged places, full of thought-provoking discussions, where dearly held ideas are challenged. I don’t want to see such exchanges give way to fear and silence because of concerns that someone carrying a firearm may react to that in a violent way.I fear campus carry because 65 percent of Wisconsinites oppose the legislation. If passed, it would mean Republican legislators are publicly choosing to put some other interest ahead of their duty to their hardworking, honest constituents.I fear campus carry because it may be yet another step designed to drive away qualified faculty, a punishment of sorts for their speaking out against the legislature’s previous attack on tenure.I don’t want to see my exceptional, qualified professors faced with the decision to leave their academic home for the confines of a safer campus where their presence is respected and sought after.I fear campus carry because, according to a study by the late UW-Madison Professor Leonard Berkowitz, the presence of a gun in a room makes people act with more aggression.I fear campus carry because our campus undeniably uses excessive amounts of alcohol, and pairing alcohol with firearms leads to unequivocal mistakes.I fear campus carry as a woman because studies find it only perpetuates campus rape, with a 50 percent increase in rape on campuses in Utah following the passage of such legislation.I fear campus carry because if I cannot feel safe in a classroom, one of the most sacred spaces for learning and the sharing of ideas, where can I feel safe?I fear campus carry even with all my privilege, but most of all I fear for the safety of my marginalized peers, who do not benefit from the same protection from hate crimes that my white skin allows.So the time must be now. I refuse to sit idly by as the very purpose of our university is transformed from a place of knowledge, intellect and learning to a battleground.I ask the friends, staff, alumni, students, professors and family of UW-Madison to join the opposition for campus carry and call their legislators on the campus-wide Day of Action, Dec. 15, to tell them we cannot risk another loss and we cannot afford guns in our classrooms.Kat is a sophomore majoring in Political Science and GIS Cartography.

Chair Carmen Goséy encouraged members to ask questions and think critically about the proposed amounts before the budget is brought for debate at an upcoming Student Council meeting. A final budget must be submitted to ASM’s Student Services Finance Committee by Nov. 9, according to ASM bylaws.Due to a change in council members’ compensation from stipends to an hourly wage, the budget plans to dip into ASM’s reserves. Goséy said that she plans to “re-work” parts of the budget to find ways to offset this in the upcoming weeks.Some line items showed more money allocated to student groups than in the past. Both the Rape Crisis Center and the Tenant Resource Center had higher budgets for the upcoming fiscal year, and some council members asked if this could be changed to allocate those funds to other areas. However, Scanlon explained that due to contracts negotiated by past council members those line items could only be changed when the contracts came up for renewal.“It’s about $1.4 million, and so it’s kind of cool that people in this room and Student Council get to write the budget,” said Goséy.Before concluding the meeting, Goséy announced that the Westboro Baptist Church will visit campus for a half-hour Oct. 20.“They come for a half-hour, say whatever they want to say, and then they leave in order to stir up the people that are around them,” Goséy said.Goséy will speak with the Faculty Senate Monday to discuss how ASM and faculty can support each other to stand with students on campus during the event.",Preliminary ASM budget previewed at Coordinating Council meeting,UWM

A group of county representatives and correctional design professionals then developed a strategy from that report for the county to execute.The resolution explicitly said the improvements are only a short-term solution to the most significant problems in the building and “should not be considered a long term solution or fix.” The county will continue working toward decommissioning the jail, according to the resolution.“Any delay in moving out of the CCB Jail will continue to increase the risk and exposure of staff and inmates regarding health and life-safety concerns,” the resolution reads.The mitigation measures specifically will cost $3,990,940. They include replacing the cell block and cell door sliding devices, replacing outdated analog cameras and cable with digital infrastructure and testing the water for lead and other contaminants.Windows in the building are currently fixed and will be replaced with operable units. The update will allow for smoke ventilation in the event of a fire. Currently the building is considered “windowless.”The additional $141,210 will go to “soft costs” associated with managing the project. The project will spend capital funding that was already allocated.“This is kind of a band-aid,” said County Board Supervisor Hayley Young, District 5. “But it is a band-aid that we really, really need. So that’s why there was the support for this and that’s why it’s called ‘Life and Safety Amendments.’”The county will have to approve additional funding in the 2017 capital budget for increased staffing during the construction, compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act and inmate transportation. The original ordinance said those items would be “approved,” but the Board amended the language that to say those items will be “considered” in 2017.Young also toured the facilities, which have newer and older portions, before voting on the resolution.“If you compare the older facility with the newer part, you can see the newer part is following best practices,” Young said. “It is just a frankly better facility than some of the older parts. Touring that I think makes something like this, you really see why this is necessary.”Dane County Executive Joe Parisi still must sign the resolution before it becomes law. According to the contract, the project is expected to start June 1, 2017.",‘Life-safety improvements’ coming to City-County Building Jail,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/04/mental-health-freedom-of-speech-clash-in-fight-over-trigger-warnings,"April 18, 2016 | 6:00am CDT","The 1960s and 70s were known for progressive activism, and few places better embodied these movements than college campuses.UW-Madison in particular was known as a center of student involvement in social issues.When UW System Board of Regent Tim Higgins, a self-described “good conservative” from a parochial school in Appleton, arrived at UW-Madison in the early 1970s, he was in for quite a culture shock. Higgins said fellow students challenged his viewpoints from the moment he stepped on campus.“It certainly expanded my horizons,” Higgins said. “Sometimes the learning you get from confrontation is more valuable because it goes beyond the bounds of academic rigor and makes you think about how you live your life.”The push for trigger warnings, notifications given to students for whom classroom material may bring back past trauma, divides this coalescence of student activism and student freedom.Many individuals, such as recently retired political science professor Donald Downs, see the movement as a generational shift for student activists.“I’m from the 60s generation, and we wanted more freedom,” Downs said. “We didn’t want paternalism. We didn’t want administration trying to protect us.”Student activists today, however, believe these are inaccurate characterizations.“I think the idea of sheltered or coddled college students is misguided.The intent of trigger warnings is not to shut down discussion,” said Lizzy Schounard, vice chair of UW-Madison College Democrats. “Trigger warnings aim to help students feel comfortable, safe, and empowered in the classroom.”Beyond making students comfortable, trigger warnings may also provide tangible mental health benefits.According to Samantha Johnson, the undergraduate violence prevention specialist for the campus group End Violence On Campus, trigger warnings can help when students are presented with graphic content.“We know sensory information like that can trigger flashbacks to harm done to them, or even anxiety and panic attacks,” Johnson said. “So having that self-preparation has both a health benefit, and prepares that person to engage in the dialogue.”EVOC advises professors and teaching assistants on how best to integrate potentially triggering material in the classroom, Johnson stated.EVOC also uses trigger warnings at events it hosts on campus, which often concern themes of sexual violence.“We always like to give a heads-up that people are welcome to participate at their own pace,” Johnson said. “It’s sort of a challenge-by-choice situation. People may choose to engage, people may choose to just listen.”While this selective participation may work for EVOC events, many believe it can make the classroom a less academically challenging environment.“It sort of boils down to what a college education is supposed to be,” Downs said. “It’s supposed to be challenging. It’s supposed to present things that make us uncomfortable to a point.”To Higgins, it is not the professor's responsibility to sort through all potential triggers in class material, nor is it very realistic.“As a student you have a responsibility to protect yourself. If somebody assigns a book and you’re really concerned about a rape scene, well, you need to find out if that’s going to bother you,” Higgins said.According to Neil Simpkins, a PhD student in the English department who co-authored a paper on trigger warnings last year, this slippery slope could be avoided by simply talking to students.“Rather than the professor saying ‘this is what I assume is triggering to my students,’ they could use some kind of anonymous form for students to be able to say ‘this is what I need a trigger warning for in this particular classroom context,’” Simpkins said.Schounard also said concerns about trigger warnings damaging the classroom are exaggerated, however their mental health benefits are essential for some students.“Trigger warnings are just that: a warning,” Schounard said. “Professors showing highly controversial, graphic, or potentially triggering content should be compelled to provide trigger warnings to the benefit of their entire classroom, and if even one student is made to feel more comfortable, then it has done its job.”As a professor, Downs says he would object to being subjected to a mandated trigger warning rule.“We end up encouraging students to feel victimized and to feel offended all the time,” Downs said. “It’s not a sign of mental health in a society when more and more people feel like they don’t have mental health.”Ultimately, Downs said he believes a school-wide policy isn’t necessary to achieve what student activists are pushing for.“A lot of it is just common sense respect for your students,” Downs said. “We don’t need a whole trigger warning policy and movement to tell faculty that if you’re dealing with stuff that’s disturbing material, maybe they should prepare their students for it.”As current student activists fight for trigger warnings as part of their vision of mental health justice and opponents denounce the movement as an attack on free speech, the debate on the issue gets more contentious, and possibly less productive.“Whether or not [trigger warnings] ultimately get taken up, the discussion around them should be different than what it is,” Simpkins said.","Mental health, freedom of speech clash in fight over trigger warnings",UWM

I meet many of the stereotypical expectations of being a millennial; I consider myself to be tech-savvy and plan on voting for Bernie Sanders in my home state’s primary. However, millennials are often written off by members of other generations as entitled, lazy and unable to deal with adversity. While this is obviously a blanket statement and not true in many cases, it is not a stereotype without foundation.College campuses are some of the most liberal political ecosystems in the country, with UW-Madison being no different. Young, politically minded students with their lives ahead of them often want to change the world, taking leaps and bounds for social justice. In the days leading up to last week’s Wisconsin primary, murals and messages adorned the walls, stairs and streets of campus encouraging students to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a democratic socialist candidate who, according to CNN, garners 83 percent of the vote for those between the ages of 18 and 29. While all of this is fine and dandy, it seems that the message of equality and camaraderie that so many young people shout from the mountain tops is only applicable to people who share the same views.Recently, students at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor spotted chalk markings across campus reading #StopIslam and #Trump2016. According to the Michigan Daily, instead of shaking the markings off or simply ignoring them, students chose to call the police to report them and have them removed. While I am one of the first people to denounce the hateful and controversial policies that Donald Trump has contributed during his campaign, I am also the first to call bullshit on students who cannot live with opinions that don’t coincide with their own.It is instances like these where millennials get a reputation for being unable to deal with opposing views or tough situations. We live in a society where social media is a major part of our lives, where we can selectively choose the opinions we hear about and those we don’t and where many people insist on a visual or written “trigger warning” to precede potentially offensive content. Trigger warnings began as a warning for sufferers of major traumatic experiences such as PTSD, rape or child abuse. However, they have now evolved into examples of extreme political correctness that are used by some to block out all opinions and views that sway from their own.While you are not required, or even expected, to find the positive in every political candidate, it is imperative that everyone’s right to vote and share their views be treated equally. There is no reason why a Bernie Sanders chalk mural should be heralded while a similar Trump statement is reported as offensive and repulsive. Freedom of speech and the democratic process are some of the things that make the United States such a great country; we shouldn’t isolate ourselves from the views of our opposition because we cannot bear to hear something that is different from our personal mantra.As I stated at the beginning of this article, I am a proud millennial. However, we as a generation need to practice what we preach and be more accepting of people who don’t agree with us word for word. While I am not expecting anyone to artificially agree with something they don’t, I think that everyone deserves some basic form of respect, and erasing the political views of someone who supports Donald Trump not only is close-minded but invalidates that person and their right to share their views. Instead of voluntarily isolating ourselves from the opinions we don’t agree with, we should instead acknowledge that everyone has a right to share their views and simply let our voices be heard in the voting booth this November.Samantha is a freshman planning on majoring in communication arts and journalism.

He has been a teacher, an entrepreneur and a board member and director of the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County, but his first role was as a student athlete on the men’s basketball team.Jackson played 99 games over the course of four seasons, and when he finished his career in 1989 he was the third-leading scorer in UW-Madison basketball history. His athletic eligibility ended in 1989, and Jackson began playing abroad.Between international seasons, he returned to Madison in the summers to take classes and inch towards his credit total needed to graduate, finally earning his degree in 1994.Following his basketball career, Jackson spent a brief period in Miami, Fla., where he worked as a substitute teacher before returning to Madison in 1998 as a full-time teacher. During the next decade, he earned his MBA and worked for the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County in several different roles.After these positions, he started working on an athletic clothing company called ROUGH Sportswear. He founded the company in the spring of 2009, and it grew quickly, earning its big break in 2012 when it sponsored boxer Daniel Ponce De León in a fight that was viewed by more than 20 million people. Following the fight, he has received offers to purchase ROUGH for more than $1 million from several companies, including Adidas.Though the company became almost immediately lucrative, Jackson said ROUGH has stayed true to the meaning of its name, as it is an acronym for “reach out, you get help” and “reach out, you give help.”He said since the founding of the company a priority has been to give back.“If there is anything that ROUGH is about, it’s second chances,” Jackson said.In the past four years, ROUGH has given more than $50,000 of unrestricted donations to numerous local charities in Madison, including the Dane County Rape Crisis Center and the Boys and Girls Club of Dane County.ROUGH Sportswear will hold their second annual 5k run-and-walk to raise money for Porchlight Homeless Solutions. Last year the event raised roughly $2,000, and Jackson said he hopes to raise about three times that amount this year at the April 10 event.Jackson encouraged everyone to attend the event, even those who dread the idea of exercising.“If you can’t spend 30 minutes suffering a little bit, either walking or running, then [you should] think about those who live in those elements,” Jackson said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/02/beasts-of-no-nation-evokes-difficult-emotions,"February 25, 2016 | 7:08pm CST","Why are movies made? What motivates a director, a writer or a production company to invest time and money for a film? If recent projects in Hollywood provide any proof of this, it would seem that the answer is to make money. Every so often a cord seems to strike with audiences, and when the film industry finds that cord, they do whatever they can to make a profit off it by replicating what makes that cord resonate, leaving anything divergent of this trend lying in the shadows as a result. I enjoy big blockbuster productions immensely, but it was in these shadows that I found myself watching Cary Joji Fukunaga’s “Beasts of No Nation,” which sounded a much deeper, emotional cord than any mainstream film of recent memory.“Beasts of No Nation” is a limited-release film distributed by Netflix. It centers around a young West African boy, Agu, as he is separated from his family and forced to become a child soldier in the midst of a civil war. The film begins on a lighter note, depicting Agu playing in his village with friends and family, but gradually shifts to a tone of escalating darkness when the village is invaded by military rebels fighting in the war, resulting in the death of Agu’s father and brother. Agu is soon assimilated into the ranks of the “NDF,” a military faction of the civil war, headed by the Commandant, played by Idris Elba. The film hinges on the juxtaposition of childhood innocence with the horrors of war, making for an emotionally taxing film from start to finish.It is absolutely heartbreaking to watch Agu and the rest of the child soldiers spiral into the darkness of combat, and that is largely credited to Abraham Attah’s raw performance. There’s a scene where Agu’s closest friend in the battalion is shot, forcing Agu to carry him onward through the battleground. The boy dies while still on Agu’s back, and all the young soldiers can do to commemorate his death is quickly cover him with leaves from the foliage so they can continue to fight. This moment, like the rest of the film, is disconcerting and heavy with emotional realism.Idris Elba is also captivating in his role as the Commandant. What startled me about his character was his allure. As a warlord with reign over these boys, the Commandant is not overtly ruthless; in fact, his allure at the onset of his appearance is shocking, and in many ways, he embodies a paternal role for Agu very soon after he loses his father. It was both fascinating and unsettling to watch Elba peel back the layers of this man, proving that the Commandant is far more complex than my stereotype of what a warlord is.In one word, “Beasts of No Nation” is striking. It is arguably one of the most difficult movies I have ever watched, not because it was bad—on the contrary, it was beautifully executed—but because it deals with themes and ideas that we don’t get to see in mainstream films, and perhaps there is a reason for that. The movie touches on issues of war, violence, rape, sex and drugs, all of which are topics that are not easy to discuss. However, if its critical acclaim and Idris Elba’s recent SAG award for Best Supporting Actor means anything, perhaps these are the ideas that really matter in filmmaking. While I can’t say “Beasts of No Nation” is a film that I would want to watch again, watching it was a necessary experience because it grabbed me, rattled me and forced me to think about the issues and themes that don’t get enough recognition in the media. There is certainly merit in making films that will resonate with the audience’s wallets, but if the real reason to make films is to get audiences to think about difficult questions and to feel difficult emotions, then “Beasts of No Nation” encapsulates every aspect of that.",'Beasts of No Nation' evokes difficult emotions,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/02/letter-to-the-editor-god-bless-contraception,"February 8, 2016 | 11:00am CST","An Op-Ed published in The Daily Cardinal titled “The social impact of contraception” claimed the increased use of contraception has had a “devastating impact on our families, relationships and our society.” The author, Ben Miller, cites Pope Paul VI’s Humanae Vitae, an encyclical published in 1968 that predicted an increase in infidelity, objectification of women, overreach and corruption by public authorities, and immoral attempts by humankind to control their bodies if contraception use became widespread. Due to the flawed logic of his argument and disregard for the positive effects of contraception, we felt it necessary to respond.As two men writing about contraception we cannot fully understand the female experience and we underline the need for the inclusion of women in this discussion and the development of policies related to sexual health.A quick evaluation of the author’s argument illuminates a disconcerting lack of statistical knowledge. The author’s assertions are presented in the following manner:1. A occurs before B2. Therefore, A is the cause of B.The logic collapses because Miller tries to create an artificial cause-and-effect relationship. While correlation is an important indicator, the strength and direction of a relationship must not be confused with causation. A lack of experimentation and investigation where dozens of variables are uncontrolled has led Miller to leap to the unjustified conclusion that contraception has caused a number of phenomena.Miller’s argues access to contraception has increased since 1968 and as a result divorce and marriage infidelity rates have increased.Based on this logic, one could write about the coinciding fall in divorce rates in Maine and the decreasing consumption rates of margarine. Or consider the more convincing relationship between an increase in Japanese car sales in the U.S. and an increase in suicides by crashing a motor vehicle from 1999 to 2007. Both situations have extremely high correlations but are spurious relationships, as the presence of other variables goes unaccounted for.Miller’s first argument is that widespread use of contraceptives has led to “marriage infidelity and the general lowering of morality.” He cites an increase in the divorce rate and marriage infidelity in the U.S. This claim is simply unsubstantiated. According to a New York Times article and Justin Wolfers, a University of Michigan economist, the rate of divorce has actually fallen in the U.S. and Europe after peaking in the 1980s. Reasons for this drop are varied but include later marriages, birth control and changing gender roles.Additionally, he states an increase in abortion, out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections as evidence for decreased sexual morality. Here is why he is wrong: first, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a source also cited by Miller, abortion has been trending downward and recently reached its lowest point since 1973. If the author wishes to see further decrease in abortion we suggest supporting access to contraception, as it is arguably the most indispensible tool for preventing unplanned pregnancy. Abstinence, which he mentions, is an unrealistic, didactic solution that robs humans of one of life’s greatest pleasures. Furthermore, in many male dominated societies women are not afforded the option of adhering to abstinence.Along with his use of inaccurate statistics Miller insinuates that out-of-wedlock pregnancies are an indicator of moral decay. On the contrary, there is nothing wrong with having children outside marriage. The majority of children in Scandinavia are born “out-of-wedlock” and yet somehow the fabric of their society remains intact. Finally, while sexually transmitted infections are a huge problem across the globe, they are not a sign of moral deficiency and contraceptives are one of the most important tools to battle these diseases. UHS and Sex Out Loud are more than willing to provide education on the use and purpose of contraceptives.In his second argument, the author contends, “our relationships have universally suffered” as a result of increased sexual objectification of women. This argument shows a complete lack of respect for history and the progress made by early feminist movements to improve economic, career, and social fulfillment for women. Before 1977, women could lose their jobs for getting pregnant, marital rape was not recognized as a criminal offense, sexual harassment was not recognized in the workplace and women were not allowed to hold credit cards. While issues such as rape culture, the gender pay gap and unequal representation in business and government still plague women, their place in society has undoubtedly improved.The author’s dogmatic view on contraception ignores the tremendous good it has done throughout the world. The benefits of contraception include protection against STIs, the empowerment of women through the prevention of unwanted pregnancies, a reduced need for abortion, and a decrease in the risk of ovarian cancer. This is particularly important for women in developing countries where accidental pregnancy can have dramatic consequences on their health and economic situations. Furthermore, contraception can be used for reasons not related to the prevention of pregnancy such as regulation of menstrual cycles.In nearly five decades since Pope Paul VI published his encyclical, society has improved due to greater access to contraception. His argument and that of the author is neither enlightening nor truthful, and we are concerned about the effect such views have on public policy. As Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens said in response to Pope Paul VI, “I beg you my brothers let us avoid another Galileo affair. One is enough for the Church.”Eoin and Matthew wrote this article as a response to Ben Miller’s Feb. 4th article titled “The social impact of contraception.” Eoin is a senior majoring in geography and journalism, and Matthew is a senior majoring in political science.

It has affected my hopes, dreams, mannerisms and particularly, my viewing habits. I have tried to suppress this indulgence, but it still holds a firm grip on my life. No matter how hard I try, I cannot subdue it: I am an anglophile. There, I said it. I plan out my imaginary future vacation to England, I gravitate towards the many delights of the BBC, I often brew too much tea. I even changed the setting on my iPhone to a Siri with a British accent. Why is this relevant, you might ask? Well, as any fellow anglophile knows, the series “Downton Abbey” is not only a television show, but a ritual. Every Sunday, I look forward to Laura Linney introducing Masterpiece Classic, the montage of sifting book pages and even the ever-present Viking River Cruises ad because I know what joy awaits me. This joy, I regret to say, must come to an end. ""Downton Abbey"" is running its last season (or series, for all you anglophiles out there).For the few of you who have not yet discovered this treasure of a show, I will elaborate. “Downton Abbey” is a British period piece that follows the life and times of the wealthy Crawley family and their servants. All of this takes place under the roof of Downton Abbey, an elaborate home that is arguably a character on its own. By the end of the series, it will have been on air for six years. However, the premise spans from 1912 to 1925, beginning with events such as the Titanic disaster and the introduction of electricity to domestic homes and continuing through World War I and post-war England. Throughout this duration, each character evolves along with the shifting horizons of the world that surrounds them. As the time period transforms, so do the small specificities that officiate the series as a true period piece with faithful accuracy. It is truly beautiful to watch. Every detail is carefully attended to with care, precision and respect to the year in which it is set.What truly elevates the show to the success it is today is how relevant and relatable the content is, despite the era it depicts. It addresses and explores issues that were works in progress at the time and still are today, such as sexism, racism, homophobia and even rape culture. I have grown to care about each character; I root for characters I never thought I would have at the beginning of the series. This marks how wonderfully the series generates not only historic change paving way for modernity, but also the evolution of its characters. As annoying as the middle sister, Edith, was at the beginning, she finally found our hearts when desperately trying to escape the social imprisonments and stigmas surrounding women while trying to manage a magazine. Thomas once was the character everyone loved to hate; however, we have come to understand how he has struggled personally, whether it be through society’s lack of acceptance of him as a homosexual man or when he was weaned out of a job at Downton due to economic cuts to downstairs staff. I also became fully invested in the relationships of the series as I watched them progress, from Mary and Matthew Crawley’s arranged-marriage-turned-true-love, to Anna and John Bates' imperiled downstairs romance, to the focal point of the final season so far: Ms. Hughes and Mr. Carson, the leaders of the downstairs staff. This season feels much slower, but it makes sense considering everything is winding down to an inevitable finish.In a sense, “Downton” is an ode to changing times, with the beauty of the past gracefully accepting the future. By the time the show ends, I will miss the exquisite setting of Britain’s Highclere Castle as Downton, the immaculate costumes, the sing-songy dialect and, of course, the snappy one-liners from Maggie Smith’s unforgettable Violet Crawley. The series manages to fully encapsulate a beautiful moment in history and seamlessly relay its stories as relatable and timeless in their own way. Initially, I was irritated and impatient when waiting for the episodes to be released in the U.S. after the British had the privilege of viewing them first. However, now that the show is ending, I am almost glad to have waited because at least I will have “Downton” with me for a little longer. As the series ends, us American anglophiles will mourn, yet we must remember the takeaway message of the series—in order for there to be change, one must accept the future, even one that no longer holds a series as special as “Downton Abbey.”",Final season of Downton Abbey continues to portray past with relevance,UWM

The country’s new policy was enacted recently when the President of the United States, Donald Trump, left for his visit to this Asian country. Despite President Trump’s recent claims that China committed the “greatest theft in the history of the world,” is “raping our country” and that their M.O. is to “lie, cheat, and steal in all international dealings,” Xi Jinping welcomed him with open arms. “I respect Trump,” he said, teary-eyed before the President’s private jet landed in Beijing. “He is really just a genuine guy. I wish I was as great of a leader as he is. My people don’t idolize me like that.”China’s president gained his composure as Trump’s plane landed, sneakily hiding his “I <3 Trump” button before their encounter. The two leaders embraced for what seemed to have been slightly too long, and then embarked on their parade through the city to their meeting place.

The legislation passed the state Senate on a 29-4 vote.The amendment is intended to create more privacy for victims by ensuring their right to deny defense attorneys’ interviews, be heard at preliminary court hearings and to protect their ability to attend all proceedings of the trial. The amendment also removed previous language that allows victims to seal their records.Resolution 53 is based on the campaign Marsy’s Law, established after a California woman, Marsalee Nicholas, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, who later confronted her mother and brother in a grocery store after he was released on bail. The Nicholas family, who was unaware of the perpetrator’s release, then established a campaign in an effort to create further protections for victims.Before the vote, the legislation had over 200 key endorsements from supporters, including survivors. Many victims have gotten involved to help push the passing of this legislation. One of the leaders of the push for new victims’ rights legislation in Wisconsin originally stemmed from domestic violence victim-turned spokeswoman, Teri Jendusa-Nicolai.In 2004, Jendusa-Nicolai survived an attack from her ex-husband. She has since become a prominent advocate of victims’ rights and a major supporter of Marsy’s law.“Our lawmakers continue to demonstrate their concern for survivors like me, and I am deeply grateful for their support of this bipartisan legislation that will give victims a stronger voice in the courtroom,” Jendusa-Nicola said after today’s vote.Fiona Wakefield, a recent graduate of Madison College, also said she contacted legislators to share her story, urging them to put themselves in the victims’ shoes.“I was 14 when I was raped. Statistically that gives me 86 years left of life. The chances of me running into my rapist are pretty high with those odds,” Wakefield said. “Could you imagine the trauma of being approached without warning? This law is extremely important, and puts rights’ back into the hands of survivors and their loved ones, where it is deserved.”The bill now moves to the state Assembly, who will vote on the proposal on Thursday.",'Marsy's Law' boosting crime victim protection clears state Senate,UWM

Andre Jacque, R-De Pere, told The Cap Times.The state Senate Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety also held a public hearing Thursday on Senate Bill 423, which would place restrictions on the use of fetal tissue obtained by induced abortions as part of medical research.Proponents of the bill say they don’t have an issue with fetal tissue research, but rather with using fetal tissue from induced abortions for that research.Opponents of the bill say restricting fetal tissue research would disrupt important research pertaining to cancer, Alzheimer's and other fatal diseases. The University of Wisconsin Medical School uses fetal tissue for research in those fields.Using fetal cells and tissue is already heavily regulated under both federal law and UW-Madison’s institutional policies. UW-Madison strictly complies with all federal research regulations and opposes profiting from fetal tissue sales, according to UW Health.Banning fetal tissue research, however, would be “detrimental,” according to medical school officials.“We strongly urge the state Legislature to reject a ban on fetal tissue research in Wisconsin,” said Lisa Brunette, spokesperson for UW Health. “The ban would be devastating to the remarkable opportunity we have to develop new, lifesaving vaccines, therapies and cures that will benefit patients across Wisconsin.”Republicans have begun offering competing proposals on the bill restricting fetal tissue research, such as a proposal to only ban the sale of fetal tissue and put regulations stem cell research on fetal tissue obtained since January 2017.Previously, anti-abortion proposals have been unable to generate enough support due to large groups of opponents and difficulty among Republicans leaders to reach a consensus.It is unsure as to whether Republicans will be able to come to an agreement on which direction to take. Although the fetal tissue bill received a public hearing in the Senate, there is currently no scheduled vote on the calendar.The state Legislature has limited time to pass both bills since the legislative session is coming to a close and lawmakers will not return to vote until January.

Johnson wrote again Monday to Inspector General Steve Linick, demanding further action be taken.The letter encourages investigators to “...examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the potential consumption of tainted alcohol.”Wisconsin Democratic senator Tammy Baldwin also sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson following the death of Connor.“I am gravely concerned that the State Department is not taking seriously the health and safety risks to U.S. citizens posed by illicit alcohol,” Baldwin said in the letter. “To date, the Department’s actions have not matched its stated concern for the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad.”Both senators have expressed frustration over the lack of transparency revolving the case and are still waiting on a response from the Mexican Embassy in order to obtain answers on theincident.Siblings Abbey and Austin Conner were found face down in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar pool after consuming potentially tainted alcohol provided by the resort. After being taken to a local hospital, Austin recovered, but Abbey was pronounced brain dead and was soon taken off of life support.The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported on the case and since then over a hundred people have come forward comparing similar stories of their own blackouts at resorts across Mexico. There are reports of rape, unconsciousness and robbery after low levels of alcohol consumption.These cases have not been resolved and there is speculation that the resorts are tainting the alcohol in conspiracy with local hospitals in order to gain large sums of cash from the tourists who seek medical care, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.The U.S. has not been tracking the cities or the resorts at which these incidents are occurring, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Having listened to recordings of Tagaq’s work, I knew to expect a concert experience unlike any I had heard before, but nothing could have prepared me for Saturday’s show.Flanked by an electric violinist and drummer who made use of electronic percussion and sequencing, Tagaq addressed the audience prior to commencing her renowned vocalizations. Noting that her backing chorus had been assembled and trained recently, she described the development as an improvisation and praised it for its uniqueness.Tagaq confronted the crowd, many of them older than the typical college student, with a tremendously diverse array of sounds. She utilized melodic pitch sequences, grunts, groans and other noises — far too many to enumerate. The Canadian performer informed concertgoers that her work was a contemporization of Inuit vocal practices traditionally executed by a pair of women through a friendly competition.Throughout the demonstration, Tagaq made intense movements and vivid facial expressions which accompanied her singing. Her choreography made for a stunning visual spectacle, though watching her bandmates was fascinating as well. Closing my eyes intensified the impact of Tagaq’s sound and allowed my mind to become more imaginative, but this was at the cost of missing her profound physical displays.A self-described freak show, she asked attendees not to photograph her in any way during her performance. No image or recording could encapsulate the experience of intaking Retribution in live fashion. Tagaq’s expressions were as courageous as they were complex; she routinely contorted her face and body into positions most wouldn’t dare attempt in the comfort of their own bedroom, let alone a stage.Dynamic in style, volume and consistency, Tagaq’s lengthy showcase incorporated a cover of grunge icon Nirvana’s “Rape Me” into the continuum of sonic output. Having not listened to Retribution — which includes the cover in its entirety — prior to witnessing it in person, my eyes widened when I recognized Kurt Cobain’s abrasive lyrics. The rendition was chilling.The choir, uniform in black dress but not in age, produced an assortment of support for the soloist, including clicking noises that resembled slow-moving water. They were directed by a member of the touring act who also delivered numerous vocalizations behind Tagaq. Continually mesmerized, I felt myself repeatedly appreciating the amount of preparation required for such a presentation. Other than the percussionist breaking a stick, the piece progressed without a noticeable hitch. It required immaculate counting and memorization by all parties, and the drummer regularly sequenced Tagaq’s voice along with a multitude of other tones.As someone who has been injured in moshpits and has belted out personal favorite emo ballads from my adolescence, Tagaq’s gripping show pushed me as far emotionally as any of the three dozen concerts I’ve been to, albeit in different directions.

She said Lincoln refused to agree to a territorial governor’s proposal to sentence 350 natives to death.“[Lincoln] insists on personally weeding through all of this, and he ends up saying ‘I’m only going to take the sentences of those who we have evidence, witness evidence, that they were involved in either killing or raping, and everyone else we are going to dismiss charges on,’” Blank said.Blank said acknowledging history is “incredibly important,” but the Lincoln statue represents the importance of public education.“Abe is actually here because he was the person who really created public universities in the states throughout this country in a very real way,” Blank said. “I do not see a reason to prominently label [the killings of natives] on the Lincoln statue.”ASM Chair Katrina Morrison — whose organization passed legislation last October to recognize Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples Day — supports putting a plaque on the statue. Morrison said that while it is important to “acknowledge Lincoln’s role in creating land-grant institutions,” the university should still recognize “his brutality towards indigenous peoples.”“We wanted a plaque near Lincoln because we wanted the university to recognize his part in the Dakota 38 massacre,” Morrison said. “I think that [not putting a plaque on the statue] is a mistake, and I think that the history is irrefutable. It is clear that he played a huge role in the massacre and was killing innocent people for no reason.”Mariah Skenandore, a co-president of the indigenous student organization Wunk Sheek, disagrees with Blank’s interpretation of Lincoln’s history. Skenandore said UW-Madison’s refusal to put a plaque on the statue represents their continued oppression of marginalized students.“They don’t acknowledge the impact that it is having on their students, and I’m impacted by [seeing Lincoln on Bascom Hill] every day,” Skenandore said. “I think the plaque is the least the university can do.”Skenandore said that although the plaque seems unlikely, Wunk Sheek will continue to push for it.“If we don’t keep advocating for ourselves, no one is going to advocate for us,” she said.Wunk Sheek leaders said they will be putting signs on Bascom Monday morning promoting Indigenous Peoples Day.

Andre Jacque, R-De Pere, and state Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, would terminate a nearly five-year arrangement in which physicians from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health are given the ability to work in the Madison locations of Planned Parenthood.The legislators called the arrangement, in which “UW has provided faculty members to serve as abortionists,” at Planned Parenthood Madison clinics “appalling.”“The University has been acting as a contractor for Planned Parenthood,” Jacque told the Associated Press. “That is not the role of the government.”Since 2012, an agreement has allowed Planned Parenthood to hire out UW System faculty physicians to perform a variety of services, including family planning, disease screenings and abortions.Sixteen to 20 hours of services are provided to Planned Parenthood by approximately 10 faculty members each week, and system employees receive a compensation rate of $150 dollars per hour.Specifically, the bill would prohibit any UW System-employed physician from partaking in or assisting in an abortion procedure. It would also ban performing other services in any private organizations aside from hospitals, such as Planned Parenthood. The bill also bans training or receiving training in performing abortions outside of hospitals.UW Health spokesperson Lisa Brunette told the Associated Press that federal guidelines require the School of Medicine and Public Health to provide abortion-training services, but residents can choose to opt out of them.Currently in Wisconsin, neither state nor federal funds can be allocated to physicians, hospitals, clinics or other medical facilities with the purpose of performing abortions—barring cases of rape, incest or when the mother’s life is endangered. The bill would also observe these exceptions.Other recently proposed bills involving abortions include one that would ban the sale of fetal tissue.

Scott Walker’s controversial plan to make allocable segregated fees optional for students is approved.In a meeting held Thursday night, WSUM presented to the committee first. The station’s general manager, Dave Black, outlined the organization’s proposed budget for 2017-’18, which included a 3 percent total increase, mostly to cover technology costs.Eleven WSUM staff members, mostly students, were also present at the meeting to voice their support for the station.“When I was applying here, I wrote about [WSUM] in my application because I knew I wanted to do it,” Izzy Fradin, WSUM’s music director, told the committee. “My experience here wouldn’t be the same without it.”Erica Gelman, the station’s administrative support specialist, said that if WSUM disappeared from campus, it would have “enormous consequences” on the student body.“The opportunities on a radio station are not trivial,” Gelman said. “The activities aren’t just music, business, communications … it’s also personal growth.”After amending it to increase the salary of the station’s top-ranking student employees, the committee passed WSUM’s budget unanimously at $387,470.15.Later in the evening, Katrina Morrison, chair of the Student Activity Center governing board, presented the SAC’s proposed budget.The SAC, which is run as part of Associated Students of Madison, receives its funding from segregated fees and could be in jeopardy if Walker’s proposal passes.Morrison then took SSFC members on a tour of the SAC.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/03/optional-fees-harm-uw-education,"March 1, 2017 | 3:59pm CST","For over 100 years, UW-Madison has prided itself on the principle of “The Wisconsin Idea”—the idea that education should influence people’s lives beyond the classroom. One way that our university upholds this idea is through our student organizations. From professional student orgs that help supplement classes by introducing students to their career field, to global volunteer organizations that not only allow students the opportunity to participate in service but also to gain cultural perspective through their travels, student organizations are an integral part of the learning process here at UW-Madison. Allowing students the option of opting out of allocable segregated fees would destroy this system of education.The proposed state bill defines allocable segregated fees as fees that provide significant support to student’s campus activities in which students are responsible for deciding how the money is used (in consultation with the Chancellor and the Board of Regents). While these allocable segregated fees are only 17 percent of the total of segregated fees students pay, amounting to $88.98 per student each semester, according to UW’s Office of the Registrar, these fees fund a multitude of on-campus services. These services include, but are not limited to: the bus pass, the Rape Crisis Center, Tenant Resource Center, Badger Catholic, Sex Out Loud, SPILL, VETS Support, GUTS Tutoring and various grants for student org operations. Although many may argue that students shouldn’t have to pay for organizations that have ideologies opposite to their beliefs, it is important to remember that ASM is required to have viewpoint neutrality. That is, our student association is required to fund programs that have beliefs across the political spectrum; they aren’t allowed to favor one organization over the other because of their political principles. This is to protect diverse perspectives here on campus. Concurrent with The Wisconsin Idea, college should be a place to expose students to new experiences and push them beyond their limits of comfort. This, however, cannot fully be done without diversity of thought.Without allocable segregated fees, the nearly 900 student organizations this campus boasts would diminish. The open dialogue for cultural competency and fresh perspectives vanished. The prospective opportunity for learning outside the classroom gone.

Every week we spend hours reading organization applications, listening to hearings, asking questions and thoroughly vetting requests. Following a strict set of guidelines set by the state, the Board of Regents, ASM and our own committee, we work to be as fair and responsible as possible in the allocation of segregated fees. As members of the committee, the most common question we receive when we talk about Student Council is, “Hey, what does ASM actually do to help the students on this campus?” We wouldn’t be surprised if this is something you all ponder from time to time. Let us tell you. This year alone, we have a $550,000 budget to help fund the events, travel and daily operations of many RSOs here on campus. Gov. Scott Walker proposed his plans Tuesday for the new UW System budget. In that proposal, he asked that allocable student fees, which are distributed by students for students, become optional for students when paying tuition. In effect, our ability to empower our campus and students in a tangible way, week after week, has come under attack. It also means that other organizations and services meant for students, such as the ASM Bus Pass and the Rape Crisis Center, could disappear. Walker’s argument is that students should be able to have control over what they do and don’t fund. Yet his proposal will only move students further from that ideal. Walker says that by letting students opt out of paying allocable segregated fees, they will have more control over what is funded. In reality, letting students opt out of the segregated fee would ensure that nothing is funded. Without allocable segregated fees, no student organization events, travel or daily operation would be funded through GAC at all. There’s no choice in that, either. The money we use in GAC is collected and pooled from every student at the university and is distributed to RSOs as event grants, operations grants and travel grants by our committee. When dealing with the money and all the rules that are attached to legal allocation of student fees, we are obligated under oath to operate in a viewpoint-neutral manner. This means we are obligated to treat every student organization the same, regardless of their values and how we might personally feel about them. And believe us when we say that we have not agreed with the views of every single RSO that has come before us. After all, how could we? We are all individual thinkers and doers with unique passions—but isn’t that what makes this campus so beautiful? We have approved upward of 300 grants on this campus this year so far. In them, we have seen a stunning showcase of many passionate and diverse opinions. If the governor wants to argue that students should directly fund the events, travel and other expenses for the student organizations they do care about without having to pay for other things they don’t agree with, this doesn’t accomplish that. All this does is decrease the overall pool of funding that we have to pull from. If that financial pool goes away completely—which we suspect it will when fees are made optional—then we simply will not have student-run and student-funded events on campus anymore. So if you are an RSO that has received a GAC event or travel grant, or if you are a student who has attended any event that we have funded on campus, now is the time for you to speak up. We need to do everything we can to retain our ability as students to promote diverse interests and values on this campus. Our committee is only nine people strong, but the money that could disappear has positively impacted so many more of us.

Steve Nass, R-Whitewater, said the program signals that UW-Madison “declared a war on men” and the university thinks Wisconsin parents have done a “poor job of raising their sons by instilling in them values necessary to become a man.”UW-Madison describes the men-only program as an opportunity to have a conversation about the expectation of masculinity in a society where that concept is heightened by media, violence, alcohol, hook-up and pop culture.The program description says that “these conversations can help us better understand ourselves and empower men to work as allies to promote gender equity and social justice.”The Men’s Project also aims to discover how masculinity presents itself on campus and how to prevent negative impacts of masculinity, such as violence. To reach this goal, students will be asked about their own perception of masculinity, how their perception influences their peers and the UW-Madison’s campus.A UW-Madison spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment.Nass has critiqued UW-Madison before, threatening state funding to the university last month if a course titled “The Problem of Whiteness” was not removed.In an email Wednesday, Nass again called upon Republican legislators to reform UW System’s funding in the upcoming budget and questioned how the “supposedly underfunded” and “overworked administration” at UW-Madison “scrapped (sic) together enough dollars to offer a six-week program.”“Our friends at UW-Madison are not happy enough with labeling ‘whiteness’ as a societal problem, now are attacking another societal ill… Men and their masculinity,” Nass said in his email.But for some male students at UW-Madison, the program acts as a much-needed refreshment and an overall positive experience.“Pretty rarely do I get to speak with a group of men who are intentionally pushing themselves to think critically about themselves and their interactions with masculinity and how they affect the community,” said Sam Douglass, a UW-Madison junior who recently participated in the Men’s Project.“There are some barriers to really being open and honest about your masculinity and so being in that space kind of creates courage and helps you develop empathy and vulnerability,” Douglass said.Douglass added that Nass was mistaken in describing the program as “declaring war” on men because, in Douglass’ experience, the Men’s Project was the opposite of a war.“It encourages empathy and courage and if there was a more apt metaphor, it would be the program declares a cease-fire on... the war of domestic violence, rape culture, homophobia and suicide in men that is already waging.”  UPDATE Jan. 4, 6:00 p.m.: This article was updated to include additional responses.",GOP legislator says UW-Madison’s masculinity program declares war on men,UWM

Their events range from self-care hangouts, discussion sessions, and activism.The event was the second in what organizers hope will be a long series of collaborations. The workshop was the result of combined efforts from PAVE staff and the members of the Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, both of whom say they have put many hours into this project.“I’ve been working with them, meeting weekly, sometimes biweekly to create these events in order for people to get those conversations in their communities, and to get the Greek Community especially engaged,” Saja Abu Hakmeh, a PAVE peer facilitator, said.Hakmeh and her primary collaborator, Ricardo Rangel of Lambda Theta Phi, originally met through their job at Campus SAFEwalk, which plays its own part in keeping students safe on campus. SAFEwalk employees were posted at the event in case anyone needed a walk home afterward.Hakmeh kicked off the workshop, encouraging everyone to exercise respect, consideration and understanding during the event. As the group got warmed up, people started sharing their thoughts openly and a conversation began to take shape.Several group activities sparked dialogue regarding multiple topics, including behaviors that contribute to rape culture. Terms such as intersectionality, systems of oppression, and toxic masculinity were introduced and defined by group leaders.At times when an individual was confused about a topic, others were encouraged to try their hand at an explanation. Many students shared personal experiences and anecdotes in order to clarify their point.The workshop concluded by discussing recommended ways a person could intervene when they see something potentially harmful going on in a social situation.Rangel reflected on the program, viewing it as a small success in a long journey.“I do see a lot of our brothers recognizing that these conversations are necessary to have, and I think it has worked pretty well so far,” Rangel said. “Maybe in the future, we could have more Greek entities [on campus] join us in these conversations.”Patricia Castillo Venegas, an attendee, thought the event helped to start a dialogue, but felt more has to be done when it comes to dismantling rape culture.“Women, trans folk, non-binary folk are dying and getting raped … sometimes you need to do more than listen and believe, you need to do something,” Venegas said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/public-employees-face-uphill-battle-in-accessing-abortion-services-under-new-bill,"February 15, 2018 | 9:28pm CST","Public employees in Wisconsin could face an uphill climb when seeking abortion services under a new bill advanced by state Republicans this week.The bill would prevent the state’s Group Insurance Board, which provides health insurance to public employees, from contracting for or providing abortion services, forcing public employees seeking abortions to pay for those services out of pocket.Only 36 percent of Americans support the public funding of abortions, according to the bill's co-authors, Rep. Andre Jacque, R-De Pere and Sen. David Craig, R-Town of Vernon. The bill bars tax money from paying for abortions.“This bill protects the lives of the unborn, respects the conscience of state residents and protects taxpayers from future obligations to pay for abortions,” Craig said at a public hearing.The bill allows exceptions only in the case of life-threatening complications to the mother, as well as victims of rape and incest who report their crimes to authorities.For Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, these exceptions do not go far enough in protecting women’s agency.“It is the women who tragically have wanted pregnancies that go terribly wrong and need extensive medical intervention who will be most impacted,” Taylor said. “The biggest tragedies of their lives will be compounded when they discover that in addition to not having the child they wanted, they will not have the insurance coverage they need.”Jacque counters that an abortion does not constitute “health care.” But according to the Wisconsin Medical Society, who testified against the bill, abortion is a legal medical procedure.The bill brings Wisconsin public employees under the same restrictions as federal employees and those receiving health insurance through Medicaid, according to Jacque.“Assembly bill 128 provides equity so that taxpayers are not funding abortions for any group of people in Wisconsin,” Jacque said.In his testimony on the bill, Jacques implied that abortions cause depression, anxiety and stress in women. Debate over the bill also included “legislators questioning the veracity of rape victims,” according to Taylor.“Today, I again sat in disbelief listening to Republican male legislators question the veracity of rape victims. I was equally stunned when a Republican male legislator suggested that women should be compelled to bare children to support his economic development plans,” Taylor said.Debate over the bill comes as women protested “the exploitation of women worldwide” in the Capitol building this week dressed in costumes referencing Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel The Handmaid’s Tale.",Public employees face uphill battle in accessing abortion services under new bill,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/11/the-nightingale-presents-grim-tale-of-brutality,"November 12, 2019 | 8:00am CST","After Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent’s debut critically acclaimed feature film “The Babadook” in 2014 that challenged the notions of the horror genre, she is back with a viciously disturbing tale of brutality. It captures the mostly untold horrors committed throughout history in “The Nightingale,” released limitedly in the U.S. in August. Set during the Black War — sometime between 1820 and 1832 in Tasmania — “The Nightingale” follows an Irish convict named Claire (Aisling Franciosi, Lyanna Stark from a few “Game of Thrones” flashbacks) who is enslaved by the monstrous English Lieutenant Hawkins (Sam Claflin, “Me Before You,” “The Hunger Games” saga), who in addition to making her sing for him, rapes and torments her regularly. When Hawkins rapes Claire in front of her husband before killing him and their baby, Claire seeks vengeance with the help of an Aboriginal tracker Billy (Baykali Ganambarr) in the wilderness. “The Nightingale” is a tough pill to swallow due to the horrific atrocities committed on screen. In addition to the horrifying scene in which Claire is raped in front of her husband, several other instances of rape and brutal violence occur throughout the film. The Black War, a lesser-known phenomenon, involved savage acts of evil committed against indigenous Aboriginals by English colonists throughout Tasmania, and Jennifer Kent reminds us of this in the starkest way imaginable. Similar to the narrative of 2015’s “The Revenant,” this is the kind of film that rips a piece of your heart out. There are several scenes with disturbing violence, which while difficult to sit through, accurately depict the reality of the colonial violence that occurred. While Kent does a strong job of bringing the viewer into this bleak time in history, the writer/director gets a bit carried away at times with the level of detail she chooses to include. We as an audience would still be able to capture the essence of this harrowing war without the need for the staggering amount of rape and murder scenes that last for extended periods of time. We can understand what Claire and Billy in this time are going through and experience their unspeakable grief, yet the amount of rape and violence becomes all we remember at times due to how disturbing and realistic it is. Many will be very mortified by the film due to this and should be well aware of what they’re getting into. There isn’t enough to distract us in the film from the tragic events that unfold. Despite being a bit over-the-top, “The Nightingale” succeeds at driving the audience due to Aisling Franciosi’s ferocious and fearless performance. Few characters have experienced such torture as her’s has and the Irish actress infects Claire’s grief and trauma onto us in the most contagious way imaginable. Franciosi is an actress, who while just starting to get her name out, is a force to be reckoned with and a truly powerful performer. Her performance is pure rage and will get your blood-flowing fiercely. Sam Claflin does remarkable work as one of the single most evil characters in film and television history. Lieutenant Hawkins is a power-driven psychopath, pure evil in every sense. Claflin evokes such a heinous nature into this man that the audience roots for his demise to occur in the most atrocious way imaginable. Few villains have ever driven such anger into me, a sign of an actor who understands his character and how to control audiences. Director Jennifer Kent  knows how to keep us engaged from start to finish. Her portrayal of war as a nightmarish horror tests our every emotion and strangles us in grief. This skill of holding the audience in and generating so much pure emotion is a true gift, yet the storytelling aspect is traded for this reactionary creation. Instead of being moved by the characters’ struggles, we’re moved out of pure disturbance — the growth of the characters or the meaning behind their experiences seemingly forgotten. There needs to be more than just expressing that vengeance is all that’s left for the protagonist. The relationship between Claire and Billy as they hunt down evil men in the Tasmanian wilderness is explored, yet not intimately enough to make us connect with their duo. Having two traumatized individuals who represent violently oppressed groups of people interact for so long should have led to more of a captivating relationship, yet we’re too horrified and disturbed by the constant brutality that we forget to feel anything hopeful or positive. The potential for a deeper bond is somewhat forgotten, preventing the film from fulfilling its potential. While Kent is driven to captivate the audience and express the true horrors of the Black War, she forgets to include elements that make the film more structurally stable. “The Nightingale” suffers to find a proper pace, oftentimes feeling as if the script doesn’t have a clear purpose or a direction in mind. While intended to explore the horrors of warfare, we’re left wondering what the actual purpose of the film is after being unsettled the entire time. Jennifer Kent directs the film in such a gothic, haunting style that’s capable of bringing the happiest person in the world down. Ending on a somewhat hopeful note, “The Nightingale” is a success for its brilliant performances and its ability to get such a reaction out of us despite some narrative flaws. Many have criticized the film’s portrayal of realistic rape and violence, which are very valid criticisms. Those who brave the film will come out moved for sure, yet how they feel about having their emotions altered in such a forceful way will vary. This historically accurate depiction of brutality won’t escape our mind and is the kind of film that hits like a punch in the gut. Dominic LeRose is a writer for The Daily Cardinal.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/10/evers-reinstates-pardons-following-dasseys-request,"October 10, 2019 | 10:03am CDT","Gov. Tony Evers granted pardons to four ex-convicted felons Monday, issuing Wisconsin’s first executive pardons in more than nine years. This action came less than a week after a convicted felon featured on a popular Netflix docu-series petitioned for clemency. After an eight-year drought under former Republican Gov. Scott Walker, Evers reinstated the pardon process in June and created a body that reviews clemency applications and makes recommendations at the governor’s instruction. “I believe in forgiveness and the power of redemption,” Evers said in a press release. “People who have taken responsibility for their mistakes and who have worked to improve their lives and communities deserve a second chance.”The governor’s decision also comes less than a week after lawyers representing convicted felon Brendan Dassey filed a clemency application, petitioning for a future pardon or commutation of his life sentence. Dassey appeared as a featured subject on the popular Netflix docu-series, “Making a Murderer.”While recent pardons from the executive office may raise hope for those previously convicted, Evers remains ambiguous regarding commutations for those currently incarcerated. The last commuted sentence of a Wisconsin state prisoner occurred in 2001. Evers’ spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff told the Wisconsin State Journal earlier this summer that the governor would not be considering commutations “at this time.” The Wisconsin Constitution grants the governor authority to pardon individuals convicted of a felony. Pardons do not expunge a criminal’s record, but it serves as a formal act of forgiveness by the state that restores certain rights lost, including the right to hold public office, according to the press release. Governors from both political parties have traditionally used their pardon powers, a Wisconsin State Journal article argues. The Walker administration, however, elected not to. In June, Evers signed Executive Order #30, which re-established the state’s Pardon Advisory Board. The board assists Evers in deciding whom to pardon. Ex-felons who completed their prison sentence at least five years prior and have not committed any crimes since are eligible to submit a clemency application to the board for review. Conflict presents itself to Dassey, whose lawyers submitted an application on his behalf for a pardon or commutation last Wednesday, despite current statute, which prevents the Pardon Advisory Board from reviewing applications from felons who are still serving time.A jury found Dassey and his uncle, Steven Avery, guilty in the 2005 rape and murder of photographer Teresa Halbach. Dassey was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole in 2048. “Historically, 100 percent of pardons and commutations go to offenders who fully admit guilt and fully accept responsibility. This also applies to offenders who seek parole release,” UW-Madison Law School Professor Kenneth Streit said. Dassey’s representatives, on the contrary, argue the opposite. The official pardon application asserted Dassey was “subjected to a uniquely and profoundly flawed legal process,” and by “his prison conduct and his gentle, patient insistence on his own innocence, Brendan has shown himself to be the rare person who is worthy of clemency.” The only direct linkage between Dassey and the murder was his confession. Dassey testified in his original trial and said his confession was “made up.” His lawyers believe police officers took advantage of his mental incapacity and manipulated Dassey during interrogation to coerce a positive confession. The fame associated with Netflix’s “Making a Murderer” docu-series further complicates the matter by introducing pop-culture and public opinion into the fold. Celebrity Kim Kardashian West expressed her support for Dassey’s clemency over social media last Friday. This may add pressure onto the Evers’ administration to consider the application despite Dassey’s recent denial from the U.S. Supreme Court last year. Streit believes, however, that the high-profiled nature of the case is negligent and that judges “will do everything possible to declare that decisions will not be influenced by the media and popular opinion.”Evers told the Wisconsin State Journal that his administration will handle Dassey’s pardon request “just like we do any communication we receive.”The four men Evers pardoned this last week — Eric Pizer, 38, Kevin Sorenson, 36, Rev. Mwangi Vasser, 40, and Steven Nichols, 62 — committed crimes ranging from substantial battery to selling illegal narcotics. But Evers and the Pardon Advisory Board publicly vindicated them of their past transgressions. “A pardon can profoundly impact a person’s life by offering them an official grant of forgiveness,” Evers said in a press release. “Mr. Nichols, Mr. Pizer, Mr. Sorenson, and Rev. Vasser have paid their debt to society, made amends, and contributed to their communities. I believe they deserve a second chance.""According to a Journal-Sentinel article, the Pardon Advisory Board received 210 clemency applications since their re-establishment in June. The board will review 10 more cases in its scheduled Oct. 14 meeting. ",Evers reinstates pardons following Dassey’s request,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/07/big-little-lies-season-two-continues-show-in-perfect-direction,"July 30, 2019 | 8:00am CDT","Returning over two years since the premiere of its first season, HBO’s “Big Little Lies” continued on its own without any source material for season two and delivered a set of episodes that not only felt necessary for the sake of the characters but generated a truly intriguing, worthwhile plot. Set shortly after the accidental killing of Perry Wright (Alexander Skarsgård) when Jane Chapman recognized him to be the monster who raped her and Perry nearly beat his wife Celeste (Nicole Kidman) to death, the “Monterey Five” face demons both old and new in addition to the constant threat that their lie will be uncovered. Bonnie Carlson (Zoë Kravitz), a character who was used more strongly this season than last, deals with the guilt of fatally pushing Perry down a flight of stairs in defense of her friends in addition to the health problems of her mother, who we learn was abusive to her as a child. Bonnie’s character this season was a total wreck, which for us as the audience was a rollercoaster viewing experience. Bonnie was never made out to be the helpless damsel in distress, but rather someone dealing with the trauma from a history of abuse and the horrors of coming to reality with regret and dissatisfaction with her life. Kravitz allowed us to feel Bonnie’s pain, yet also gave her unstable character a sense of mystery and unpredictability, creating an engaging duality. Madeline Mackenzie (Reese Witherspoon) struggles with her marriage to Ed (Adam Scott) after cheating on him last season; the selfish and combative suburbanite can create a sense of empathy for us just as she did previously, a testament to  Witherspoon as an actress. She knocked the house down last season and continues to express Madeline’s weaknesses and brings layers to her character that few actors are capable of. Despite being snotty regularly, Madeline is a character who we may not want to get into an argument with, but we can recognize her personal struggles and therefore connect with her as a character. Celeste (Nicole Kidman) recovers from the horrific physical and emotional abuse she received from Perry but soon has her mother-in-law Mary-Louise (Meryl Streep) to deal with. Recognizing that Celeste is suffering from rage, grief, Ambien usage, sexual promiscuity and drinking, Mary-Louise tries to get Celeste’s two sons in her custody, fearing for their safety. Kidman’s performance is the epitome of a strong female character, one who faces real-life challenges and whose struggles don’t feel forced. Kidman excels in portraying Celeste’s emotional dichotomy in regards to her love for her late husband and the fury and passion instilled in her motherly ways. However, Streep is the one who steals the show this season. Her introduction as Mary-Louise is a brilliant addition, and having her serve as an antagonist of sorts brings the story together beautifully. Streep is someone I have always found to be a bit overrated, despite being widely regarded as the world’s greatest actress, but her performance this season has greatly changed my overall view of her. Mary-Louise is a character you ferociously hate one minute but end up empathizing with due to how her backstory is strategically used to bring layers to the character. We recognize that she isn’t someone who hates Celeste and wants revenge after her son’s death, despite learning of his violent ways, but is truly concerned for her grandchildren and wants a purpose and a sense of belonging in her depressing life.Jane Chapman (Shailene Woodley) is hounded by Mary-Louise after learning that Perry raped her and is the father of Jane’s son Ziggy. Woodley captures the struggle of handling the truth of who Ziggy’s father is and explaining this to him beautifully. Strangely, the conflict that erupts with Mary-Louise seems to bring Jane closer to her son, which provides a heartwarming relief throughout the season. We also find Jane struggle to trust men and come to terms with her love for a new co-worker at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which was a touching gesture throughout the show because we were able to see Jane humanized after her scared existence from last season.Lastly, the arrogant, rude and controlling Renata Klein (Laura Dern) has her wealthy world turned upside down when her husband Gordan gets in trouble for illegal financial actions and causes them to file for bankruptcy. Dern gives the best performance in the show for her consistent skills in expressing pure anger and frustration, her character a ticking time bomb who unleashes her fury without any trace of difficulty. While Renata isn’t easy to empathize with at all, Dern brings an infectious distaste to the character that you love to hate, her behavior a cringe-worthy demonstration of utter madness and greed. She’s impossible to take your eyes off of due to her unpredictability and wild anger.  “Big Little Lies” had the difficult task this time around of proving to audiences that it had a clear direction building off of season one. The showrunners had to create fresh new conflicts that weren’t predictable and to make the story grounded by the characters' struggles. What struck me most about this season is how it was able to remain in fashion from its predecessor, yet hold an original identity to itself and create a new story that left us hungry for more after every episode. The show’s beautiful location of Monterey and Carmel, California could steer the show into being a typical suburban drama about unsatisfied women, yet what makes the story so enriching is how it uses wealth as a shield for these women. It expresses how the deeply human struggles surrounding marriage, trust, loss, trauma, grief and fear are universal issues regardless of economic status. So many things could have gone wrong and felt like sappy, melodramatic garbage, but “Big Little Lies” constantly shields itself from any clichés or failures and remains consistently invested in its fierce, vulnerable female characters that are not only relatable but genuinely interesting. “Big Little Lies” excelled yet again in tackling so many important topics through these women, yet was able to avoid crumbling in its ambition like so many other shows and films do when focusing on so many different themes and conflicts at once. The show used its dramatic potential to its utmost ability with its excellent writing and delivered a tremendous outcome full of delicious drama and magnificent performances. We’re trusted to understand and connect to these characters after being away from them for so long, and not for one second did it seem like we didn’t recognize them or connect with their conflicts. Ending on a poignant bittersweet note (which I will admit was a bit underwhelming considering the stakes the plot was elevated to), it's pretty clear the show ended after its final scene. Season one ended where it could be open to more or end where they left it, and thankfully it continued and gave us a brilliant season of rich drama and personal conflicts. “Big Little Lies” ended its second season in a way that resolved the show satisfyingly and echoed its ideas intelligently while ending the journeys of the “Monterey Five.” I will admit I was worried the show would be a wreck this season, yet “Big Little Lies” proved it had more to say about its characters and delivered a well-constructed second half to an unforgettable series.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/05/the-bells-game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-5-recap,"May 15, 2019 | 6:01pm CDT","After last week’s somewhat rushed and disappointing episode, HBO aired one of the best episodes of “Game of Thrones” by a long shot this Sunday. Two weeks ago director Miguel Sapochnik gave us “The Long Night,” the giant battle at Winterfell against the Army of the Dead, which brought the remaining characters together to fight for their lives in a spectacular array of CGI and fantasy spectacles. Now he directed “The Bells,” an episode that not only shocked audiences and delivered stunning action but was rooted in powerful, emotional suspense that honored its complex characters. The beginning of the episode was focused mainly on Varys, who tells Jon after arriving on Dragonstone to claim the Iron Throne due to not only being the rightful heir but the more suitable leader opposed to Daenerys. Jon opposes, supporting Daenerys but simply not wanting the Throne. Varys writes letters revealing the truth about Jon’s Targaryen roots before being interrupted by a little girl who is trying to serve poisoned food to Daenerys. Tyrion informs Daenerys about his friend’s mission, leading Daenerys to execute Varys by dragon fire, the Master of Whispers having a bittersweet farewell to Tyrion (who confesses he turned him in) before meeting his end.Varys was one of the most fascinating characters in the entire series. His role as the show’s main politician tested the audience’s view of this man from his first appearance and allowed us to change our view of him several times. He’s a character who, despite serving many rulers, was always dedicated to one thing — protecting the realm. He died doing what he believed in, and by the end of the episode, we know he was right. Jon and Daenerys have another intimate moment by the fire before Jon pulls away, the King of the North uncomfortable with Daenerys being his aunt. Dany and Jon discuss how Sansa informed Tyrion about Jon being the true heir, thus weakening Dany’s position. Jon reminds her of how he still loves and supports her despite being Aegon Targaryen. Jon and Dany don’t have as interesting of a relationship as other duos in the show, so this scene was a forgettable necessity in order for them to continue their conflicted relationship on screen.Tyrion tries to convince Dany not to attack King’s Landing due to the collateral damage that will occur, yet she claims it is necessary and justifies her ambition based on her claim that she will be freeing the people from the tyrannical rule of Cersei. Peter Dinklage gives a brilliant performance in this episode, portraying Tyrion as being torn morally between supporting the woman he has dedicated so much to and following his moral compass. Tyrion not only saw one of his closest friends die, yet fears he may have helped support a cruel dictator’s upbringing.Tyrion is yet again threatened by Daenerys, this time for telling Varys about Jon’s lineage without her permission. The Mother of Dragons reveals to him afterward that they captured Jaime, who was found traveling their way. Tyrion meets with his imprisoned brother, who advises him to convince Cersei to surrender and sail to Pentos across the Narrow Sea together to start a new life with their unborn child. Tyrion tells his brother to have Cersei ring the bells as a sign of surrender in order to prevent the deaths of thousands of innocent people. After Jaime agrees, the two brothers have a touching moment in which Tyrion tells Jaime that he was the only person he ever had for most of his life that was respectful to him. This scene was a testament to the two men’s love for each other and all they’ve been through over the years. Despite being mistreated by everyone including his family for his entire life, Tyrion was always loved by his older brother, and the two’s last scene together was pitch perfect.   As the Northern army, Knights of the Vale, Unsullied and Dothraki reach the gates of King’s Landing, Jon, Davos, Tyrion and Grey Worm lead Dany’s army against Cersei’s. Jaime enters the city, as does Arya and Sandor Clegane. Arya is determined to kill Cersei while Clegane determined to finally kill his brother Gregor. All seems quiet until out of nowhere, Daenerys attacks Euron Greyjoy’s fleet with Drogon. The dragon torches the ships, taking out the soldiers and scorpion arrows atop the city’s bannermants as well. The Golden Company is flamed, and Jon leads the army into the city, fighting Cersei’s forces by hand.Cersei watches confidently at first, but slowly realizes she is doomed. The bells ring out of surrender to Jon and Tyrion’s relief, but the worst is yet to come. Staring at the Red Keep while on Drogon, Daenerys soon gives in to her weakness and allows her Targaryen anger to get the best of her, leading her to barbarically destroy King’s Landing by Dragonfire. While Jon and his soldiers stare down a group of Lannister soldiers who surrender, Grey Worm, still grieving from Missandei’s death, tosses his spear into a Lannister soldier, causing Dany’s army to savagely attack the civilians and soldiers of King’s Landing.Jon watches in horror, realizing Daenerys is a monster. Jon saves a woman from being raped by a Northern soldier as he tries to prevent further violence. The destruction of King’s Landing is a truly horrific sight. Miguel Sapochnik does a brilliant job balancing the sequences from Jon and Cersei’s points of view while also documenting the reactions of the civilians victimized by the fiery horror. The cinematography in this sequence is awe-inspiring. We get the most dynamic, intimate views of King’s Landing that blend terrifically with several artistic images of the subjects and characters on screen. The music in this episode builds heart-stopping suspense, as does the strategic pacing. Instead of constant kinetic action, the chaos is done in patches — the consequences of the violence being felt in every scene much more than just the violence itself.The most rewarding aspect of the episode to me was seeing Arya and Sandor say goodbye. Arya and Clegane enter the Red Keep and soon realize that the castle is being destroyed. Clegane has Arya leave, asking, “Do you want to be like me?” The Hound convinces Arya that if she stays inside, she’ll die and that her appetite for revenge isn’t worth dying. The Hound’s entire life has been consumed by his desire to get revenge on his brother for burning his face as a child and for his monstrous atrocities. He plans on dying and fulfilling his purpose, while Arya realizes she has more to live for. As they walk away, Arya thanks him, the two former foes having mutual respect for each other and part ways perfectly.This was everything I wanted for the two’s farewell. Arya has come to admire the Hound for his genuine care for her, which is a major change from previously wanting to kill him. I would argue that Arya and Sandor formed the best duo in the show, for not only did they have great dialogue and give us many laughs, but through Arya, we got to see who Sandor really was and got to see him as the dynamic character and victim that he is. Cersei watches in fear as King’s Landing erupts in flames. Patches of stored Wildfire that the Mad King Aerys stored start to burst as Drogon lights them, the screams of people echoing everywhere. Qyburn convinces Cersei to flee, the Queen and her Queensguard running into Sandor as they go down the stairs. As the building starts to crumble, Sandor kills all of Cersei’s guards but his brother. The Mountain starts to come towards Sandor, Qyburn ordering the giant knight to protect his queen, leading the Mountain to crush Qyburn’s head.As Cersei runs away, the two Clegane brothers finally fight, the Mountain and the Hound brutally wounding each other. Since the Mountain is technically a zombie, none of the Hound’s stab wounds affect him. As the Red Keep crumbles and the two brothers beat each other, the Hound suddenly starts to become overwhelmed, his last resort being to charge and tackle his brother off of the ruined structure and into a giant eruption of flames down below. Sandor Clegane’s death was not only epic, but poetic. As my favorite character, it was rewarding to see the warrior die via flames, his ultimate fear. Not only did he overcome his fear by embracing it as his means of death, but he died with purpose, fulfilling his destiny by killing his evil enemy and ending the hatred towards him in his heart that plagued him every day. Sandor Clegane was a complex, layered character whose destiny and arc was fulfilled beautifully in the best way imaginable. As Daenerys continues to slaughter people from the sky, Jaime tries to enter the Red Keep from the shore but comes across a washed up Euron who survived the destruction of his fleet. The two fight each other, Euron stabbing and insulting Jaime before the Kingslayer sticks a sword in his gut and leaves the sadistic pirate to die miserably. I enjoyed seeing Jaime defeat his lover’s new fling, but I wished we actually got to see Euron die instead of having him die offscreen.Arya runs through the streets of King’s Landing in fear, nearly dying several times as the people and structures around her are burnt and destroyed. It was a strong choice having us follow Arya throughout the madness, for it allowed us to care for the situation occurring due to putting one of the main protagonists in imminent danger. Arya tries to help several civilians, allowing us to see the kind-hearted side of the Stark girl as opposed to her revenge driven determination and killing.Jaime and Cersei reunite in the Red Keep, the two hugging as Cersei cries in fear. Seeing Cersei broken down and terrified was truly eye-opening. The cold-hearted and ruthless queen who has been confident and cut-throat ever since her walk of shame now becomes scarred and powerless, relying on the man she loves as her counsel. While Jaime knows how evil Cersei can be, he can’t help but love her. Despite being siblings, Cersei and Jaime have a genuine love for each other that can’t be broken. Jaime may be disgusted by some of Cersei’s motives and actions, yet he still loves her.As the two enter the dungeon to find the exit Tyrion told Jaime about, Jaime realizes it is blocked by a pile of stones, trapping the two. The castle starts to crumble and Jaime holds Cersei, stating, “Nothing else matters.” This is a reference to season six in which Jaime said the same thing to Cersei after their daughter Myrcella died. Jaime and Cersei have always loved each other, and while I originally wanted Jaime to kill his sister, it is much more fitting and poetic for the two to die together, just as they entered the world.Cersei may have been evil, yet this episode did a tremendous job of manipulating the audience into empathizing with someone so cold-hearted. Cersei created her own falling and is literally crushed by the symbol of her power — the Red Keep. Jaime, on the other hand, was a redeemed good man who died with honor, yet was holding onto the thing that lead him to his past sins. He can’t deny his love for Cersei, and the two can die at peace despite their differences. We end by seeing a wounded Arya walk through the barren and destroyed ruins of King’s Landing to come across a lone horse. Just like Arya, the horse somehow managed to survive. The horse is a direct symbol of Arya, for her entire storyline has been dedicated to survival and cheating death, just as she did during the Battle at Winterfell.After a spectacular and disturbing siege at King’s Landing that saw the deaths of seven characters, Daenerys is now the main enemy. The heroic savior who pledged to destroy tyranny and uplift oppressed people has now become the exact opposite of what she wanted to be. Daenerys' quest for the Iron Throne has turned her into a monster. Jon and Tyrion now realize that Varys and Sansa were right about her.Daenerys’ mad queen revelation was highly foreshadowed. In the finale of season two, Daenerys has a vision in the house of the undying in which she comes across a destroyed Red Keep with snowfall (or ash?) raining from the sky and stands in front of the Iron Throne. This symbolized how she would destroy King’s Landing and try to obtain the Throne. Additionally, we saw the shadow of a dragon flying over King’s Landing in one of Bran’s visions in season six. With the final episode of the series airing on Sunday, the remaining characters have one last conflict to overcome as a mad queen now rules Westeros. The greatest television show comes to an end after eight seasons, concluding an epic saga. The remaining characters of “Game of Thrones” have the future of Westeros in their hands.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/04/wisconsin-attorneys-grant-legal-aid-to-immigrants-along-the-border-and-within-the-state,"April 28, 2019 | 5:31pm CDT","While the southern border lies a thousand miles away, immigration issues still resonate for many members of the Wisconsin community, from immigrants who’ve made their homes in the state to attorneys and communities working to support them.  Dane County has two pro-bono immigration attorneys — one from the county’s Community Immigration Law Center (CILC) and one from UW-Madison’s Immigrant Justice Clinic. Despite their efforts to serve all those in need of legal assistance, both attorneys are frequently at capacity, leaving many immigrants without representation.“We might think that [immigration issues] are very far away from us … but we definitely have immigrant neighbors who are suffering through the vulnerability of not knowing what’s going to happen to them in the future,” CILC Attorney Aissa Olivarez said. “And they’re really seeking as much help as possible and could use our support at this time.”The IJC and CILC: Working together for Wisconsin’s immigrant communityOlivarez has personally taken on cases of 35 Wisconsin immigrants to provide legal representation for them in court during her first year as CILC’s first full-time attorney.  The CILC helps immigrants find legal representation as well as provides legal consultation to hundreds of people each year through free, biweekly clinics where volunteer attorneys answer questions on immigration law and offer tools to research information related to their case on their own.Olivarez focuses on removal defense — helping people remain in the U.S. who are at risk of being deported — and accepts as many cases as she can in order to ensure everyone has a chance at an attorney no matter their financial situation. The IJC provides free legal services to Wisconsin’s immigrant community, while simultaneously training UW-Madison law students. IJC Director Erin Barbato teaches six to eight students each year under her law license, allowing them to learn from real experience.Barbato accepts about one case per month, but since her first job is teaching, she has to be thoughtful about which cases she takes. Often, she selects those of asylum seekers and children because she believes it is the vulnerable individuals who most “need this kind of really holistic representation and also what is a good learning experience for the students.”The nearest immigration court to Madison is Chicago and the additional travel time and cost is another reason many people in this jurisdiction don’t have representation, according to Olivarez.The attorney and their clients must leave early in the morning or stay late into the night because immigration hearings start at either 9 a.m. or 1 p.m. and they typically lack funds to stay overnight. “Appearing in court at 9 a.m. after getting up at three in the morning is not the best way to practice,” Barbato said.The IJC and CILC work together to provide support for detainees and immigrants in the community beyond those they represent in court.  Once a month, Barbato and her IJC students visit Dodge County Correctional Facility — which serves about 500 people a year —  and meet with everyone who doesn’t have an attorney to give a “know your rights presentation.”Recent policies spread thin resources thinnerNational immigration policies created under Trump’s administration, along with the Dane County ICE raids that occurred this past fall, led to increased demand on already limited resources in the county and throughout Wisconsin. The CILC clinics have grown from seeing five to eight individuals over the three-hour sessions to 12 to 15, sometimes even 20.“We’ve seen an increase in the number of people who want to know more about ‘what can I do to protect myself, to protect my children,’” Olivarez said.The number of people detained far exceeds the capacity of Barbato and Olivarez. The IJC has agreed to direct all its funding — supplied only by the city and county — toward the CILC to try to hire another attorney to increase capacity, which both organizations have decided is a top priority.In the meantime, local immigration attorneys have picked up some of the cases that Barbato and Olivarez can’t — but whether they can offer services pro bono depends on the firm’s resources. Occasionally, a pro bono attorney from the National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago can also provide assistance. Ultimately a judge rules based on current immigration law, but Olivarez said studies show legal representation makes a significant difference in the court outcome.There is only a four percent chance of an unrepresented immigrant winning their removal case and avoiding deportation, compared to a 48 percent chance of winning when they are represented by a competent attorney, according to a report from the Vera Institute of Justice.While the Constitution grants a right to an attorney, this only applies to criminal cases. Since deportation is a civil case, only those able to find their own attorney are represented in court. Over the past several years, almost half of all immigration court cases have gone unrepresented, according to the same report.Last summer, Barbato jumped on the opportunity to accompany a group of law students for a week of volunteering at detention centers in Dilley, Texas, where they would be able to see the early stages of the immigration process.“It’s a really powerful way for students to learn the law and to serve some of the ultimately most vulnerable people in the world,” she said. From the border to the MidwestPerla Rubio, a first-year UW-Madison law student from El Paso, Texas, found out about student trips to the border when she joined the Latino Law Student Association. She said it reminded her of what she witnessed at home and wanted to help.For one week, Rubio and the other eight students experienced “stage zero,” working individually with women who had just crossed the border and hadn’t yet applied for asylum.Asylum is protection granted by a nation to someone who is fleeing their native country because of persecution, violence or war.People in the U.S. have a tendency to assume that the U.S. is “like paradise” for immigrants, without considering why they came or how difficult it is to relocate, Rubio believes.“People don’t just come here because they want to most of the time, it’s because they are forced in one way or another,” she said.At the border, the students explained legal terms and the legal process, sometimes simply defining what asylum was and where the women were in the process.They encouraged the women to not feel afraid to share their stories so they could advise them what parts should later be shared with officials in order to strengthen their asylum case.Immigrants in this stage do not have representation — they don’t know lawyers, don’t have money and the government does not appoint one.Women told her in tears they had been raped, beaten or threatened at gunpoint, yet they still were filled with hope, Rubio said. “You can see the strength in them and that makes you feel like [you] need to fight for them because they are fighting for themselves,” she said.  “They need people that can be their voice, that know the system at some level and want to do something about it.” Rubio explained it was tough emotionally, but that the experience allowed her to gain a better understanding of the immigration system.“I can visualize it because I know how it is and just knowing the issue with the border and the impact it has,” she said. Prior to Trump’s administration, students went on these trips without a professor. But because of the “complicated nature” of new policies, along with the emotional toll on students, Barbato said accompanying the students makes the experience better for them and those who they serve.“[The] work has gotten substantially more difficult just in terms of the new immigration policies that are in place,” she said.  “Every day it feels like I’m having to learn something new about how our government is managing a certain type of a particular asylum. It’s all changing.”Following their time in Texas, both her and her students gained a better idea of how these policies play out on the ground so they can apply this knowledge in the future, whether providing aid at the border or in Wisconsin, she said.Individuals, communities feel the urge to helpBeing removed from the border puts Wisconsinites in a unique position because they aren’t as numb to immigrants’ stories and are more likely to act sympathetically, according to Rubio.Both Rubio, whose family immigrated to the U.S. when she was 12, and Olivarez, who was born in the U.S., said they were motivated by the stark difference they saw between their own privilege and that of immigrants they’ve worked with.Rubio said she was “amazed” by people who don’t have this connection and are still ready and willing to help.“Wisconsin has shown me that there are compassionate people wanting to help. There are a lot of people actually not against the idea of allowing immigrants to come here,” she said.However, the state could be doing more to support the immigrant community — like granting driver’s licenses or in-state tuition for undocumented residents, according to both Barbato and Olivarez.“[These policies would] communicate that the state of Wisconsin and our local communities value our immigrant communities,” Olivarez said.Community members can educate themselves on how to advocate for their immigrant neighbors and the issues they’re facing. Additionally, they can volunteer to drive people to court in Chicago. Meanwhile, community organizations like Centro Hispano, founded in 1983 by local volunteers to serve Madison’s Latinx community, provide additional support for the local immigrant community through programming and services for youth and families.Both Olivarez and Barbato expressed hope that one day universal legal representation for immigrants will be possible.“We want to make sure that we keep families safe and keep families together here in Wisconsin,” Olivarez said.",Wisconsin attorneys grant legal aid to immigrants along the border and within the state,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/04/anger-poem,N/A,"By Kate GearyUnderstanding my reality seems impossible ever since I was raped twice my freshman year of college by two different men. I seem to have lost all emotions but one -- anger. After digging into that anger with these words, I felt liberated under its weight, understanding how the emotion manifested itself into every crevice of my life until I was consumed. May these words be as freeing for you as they were for me, or at least inspire you to find your own freedom, however that may be. I am angry. devastated that in one single encounter, My life was derailed and put on hold.Violated with such damaging force,By a terrible being who createdtraumatic experiences I did not request.I am angry that my perspective is so skewedAngry, that cruel men still have such a large part of me.At my wits end with trying to change it,I am deeply angry at my emotionsTaking constant attention from meAnd leaving only the feelings of beingA wreck of a human,An exhausted shell of who I was behind.These biological functions consume me destroy meAnd delight me all the sameSo I am angry that I can’t escape themAnd angry that I can’t control them.I am angry above allBecause I don’t understand them.I am angry at the worldFor its ambiguity and fragility that our species ignores with such ease.I am angry that I don’t have the answersThat I can’t create world peace,Feed the hungry,Or create opportunities for everyone to feel empowered.There is too much for my hands to achieveAnd I am angry every moment I spend ignoring these issuesTo attend to my angry self.This anger of mine,It could shape all my years to comeDefine the choices I makeAnd leave me feeding the parts of my soul that I cannot control.I am angry, but I am alive. This burden is too heavy to bearA load made for stronger shoulders than mine.So I will let it fall,Slam against the ground as gravity does its work.I will set my anger downAnd leave it on this earthI will watch the slow rise of displaced airAnd return to my beating heart.Inhale the dust from which I cameAnd continue on this path Without a map, Without the shame.My muscles will refocusEach limb shaking under its new weightAs my soul fills with grace.And I will rise, Leaving that angerFarther and farther behind with each pace.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/02/how-the-partnership-of-church-and-state-shaped-womens-reproductive-rights,"February 21, 2019 | 1:00am CST","Guided by economic incentives to promote a pro-life agenda, legislation has strained accessibility to abortion and other reproductive services across the state. While the popular opinion that abortion should be legal to at least some extent remains intact — with 63 percent of Wisconsinites in favor, according to a recent Marquette poll — the growing power of life-affirming organizations fuels discussion about whether this topic is a public health or political issue. About 40 percent of births in Wisconsin, a percent as high as any other state, take place in a religiously-affiliated institutions, according to UW-Madison Gender and Women’s Studies Professor Jenny Higgins. Wisconsin is also the only state in the country where African-American people are more likely to give birth in a religious hospital than a secular facility.While there are many different religions associated with health care systems, the rise in Catholic and Christian institutions, in particular, is significant. What is notable about these clinics, hospitals and health centers is how their ideology limits the services offered to patients.“Religiously affiliated health care centers do many types of health care well, however they do many aspects of reproductive health care poorly or not at all,” Higgins said. “This does not only refer to abortion, but also to things like tubal ligations, being able to get postpartum contraception, miscarriage management … and other aspects of reproductive health care.”Higgins believes many Wisconsinites who want reproductive health care help are not receiving necessary support from public institutions. The National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws —  NARAL Pro-Choice America — found data supporting this lack of access, revealing that 67 percent of people in Wisconsin live in counties with no abortion clinic. Growing distance from clinics challenges more than abortion accessibility Although located in high population centers, only three cities in the state have health centers offering abortion services: Milwaukee, Madison and Sheboygan. Three out of four total locations are Planned Parenthoods. These clinics have strict regulations about what days of the week abortions are permitted, the type of procedure allowed, the necessary protocol for a pregnant person to be approved for the procedure and more. Wisconsin law also requires doctors to show those considering an abortion a sonogram, as well as describe the fetus to them. “In Wisconsin, anyone seeking an abortion needs to make two trips separated by 24 hours,” Mel Barnes, the legal and policy director at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said. “That is not for any medical reason, it is solely because of state law that we require that. Women who are seeking a medical abortion have to see the same doctor on both of those visits. They have to arrange transportation, maybe getting off work, maybe child care and all of that stuff twice.”However, abortion is not the only service Planned Parenthood offers, and due to an extraction of federal funding under former Gov. Scott Walker’s first budget, many locations were forced to close.Planned Parenthood provides primary care for many patients, 10 percent of whom are men, Barnes explained while discussing the lack of general health care providers in the state. “We do certainly always try to go to population centers and go where the need is. We are a critical part of the safety net in terms of trying to fill the gaps that exist,” Barnes said. “In 2011 we were forced to close five health centers in rural communities due to a loss of state funding, and we know that in those communities, no other providers have stepped in to take our place.” A 2017 report from the Health Management Associates found nearly half of the counties that Planned Parenthood serves have no alternative health care provider for family planning services. Data from the Wisconsin Policy Analysis Lab showed how these closures exacerbated the distance of the closest abortion-providing facility for Wisconsinites.  In 2010, the proportion of counties within a 30 mile radius of an abortion clinic was 24 percent. By 2017, the number decreased to 13 percent. Accordingly, the proportion of counties between 90 to 120 miles increased from 18 percent to 29 percent for the respective years. The complicated rise of crisis pregnancy centersWhile the number of pro-choice clinics has decreased, crisis pregnancy centers, like Pregnancy Helpline in Madison, have increased by 200 percent over the past four years, according to their Executive Director Stephanie Ehle. Pregnancy Helpline, located just off UW-Madison’s campus, is a care facility offering services like maternity clothes, diapers and information for pregnant people. The organization is funded by churches, private donors and pro-life organizations. “We try to stress that although we are a life-affirming organization, we are not a political organization or a religious organization we are really just trying to help those in need that chose to parent,” Ehle said.Although most of the material goods Pregnancy Helpline offers cater to post-birth needs, they belong to an international organization and directory of many other crisis pregnancy centers attempting to provide before-birth medical services without having properly regulated licenses or credentials. This means if a person called Pregnancy Helpline seeking medical attention, they would get referred to a local affiliate organization who influences those experiencing an unexpected or unwanted pregnancy to carry it to term regardless of circumstance. Although they are advertised as health centers, their facilities are run by trained volunteers, not doctors, who offer blood tests, ultrasounds and support, rather than sexually transmitted infection testing, condoms or birth control options, like Planned Parenthood would. Many centers have 24/7 emergency call lines for all pregnancy needs, often promoting this hotline for people considering an abortion, or wanting to hear about options. However, none of the centers provide abortions or will give information about where to get one, even if getting one would be in the person’s best interest.Doctors and researchers Amy Bryant and Jonas Swartz wrote about this breach of choice in “Why Crisis Pregnancy Centers Are Legal but Unethical” in the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics. “As nonprofit organizations, crisis pregnancy centers have the right to exist,” Bryant and Swartz wrote. “However, as we have seen, they also employ dubious communication strategies — withholding information about abortion referral, not being transparent about clinically and ethically relevant details, or using inflammatory language to scare women and dissuade them from having abortions.”However, the article also mentioned the value centers like Pregnancy Helpline can have as a resource for those who do choose to continue to their pregnancy. Despite their initial intentions, these centers support clients by providing them with financial incentives. In this way, Ehle said those centers are filling the gaps.The lack of structural support from the state allows these centers to benefit those in need with resources, while simultaneously promoting their interests and biases about a person’s right to their body.Higgins blames the weak social safety net neglected by the state government more than the crisis pregnancy centers themselves. “Even though I think it's easy to get frustrated and angry because of the way in which they market themselves or the falsehoods that they convey to people about abortion, in terms of how many people they are actually deterring from getting abortions is few,” Higgins claimed. “Most crisis pregnancy center clients are people who are needing help and financial support during pregnancy and birth because they are not getting what they need from the state.” Where Wisconsin abortion policy lands and whyUnder current legislation, including the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, pregnancies can be terminated up to 20 weeks if the person is able to access care and complete required protocol. However, Wisconsin is also one of nine states retaining their unenforced abortion bans from before U.S. Supreme Court Case Roe v. Wade — which ruled that banning abortions was unconstitutional — according to the Guttmacher Institute. This makes Wisconsin a trigger state. As a trigger state, if the U.S. Supreme Court were to roll back Roe v. Wade, all abortions in Wisconsin would immediately become illegal, including rape-induced pregnancies, unless they are performed to save the mother’s life under state statute 904.04. This statute also criminalizes physicians who perform abortions with felony charges.Yet this statute does not reflect the Democratic desires of the majority of Wisconsinites. In fact, 63 percent of respondents were in favor of abortion in all or most cases, compared to 29 percent who oppose it, according to a 2018 Marquette Law School poll. While public opinion shows constituents support a pregnant person’s right to choose, the legislature remains split on the topic, pushing forward both pro- and anti-abortion policies. Sen. André Jacque, R-DePere, whose photo is displayed as an endorsed 2018 candidate for Pro Life WI, spoke out about his interest in presenting new legislation to eliminate all abortion and Planned Parenthoods.“It is also clear that UW-Madison is currently in flagrant violation of state statute 20.927 by paying state employees on state time and with state benefits and malpractice insurance to perform abortions under their arrangement at Planned Parenthood’s Madison abortion facility,” Sen. Jacque said. “There will be continued efforts to bring the UW out of willful noncompliance.”The statute Jacque is referring to controls how the funding for certain insitutitions can be used. This includes UW-Madison professors who want to research certain aspects of reproductive health, forcing them to find private grants rather than employing their salary.Higgins, who must check with legal counsel before conducting public health research, claimed this is an interruption that stymies her research. “I do think that misogyny runs deep, sexism runs deep and I think that women’s reproduction has always been used as a way of exasperating gender inequality in our society,” Higgins said. “Cisgender men are the ones who are typically making that decision, and cisgender women tend to be the ones having the negative repercussions. That is something that makes me very uncomfortable in terms of gender justice or a gender equity lens.” Pro-choice Rep. Melissa Sargent, D-Madison, said the reason women take the back seat in regard to reproductive options and health care funding is because there are so few women in charge of drafting and passing policy. “If we had more women in our legislature, I tend to think that we would have more people who are prioritizing how we take care of our women and girls because they know first hand what it is like, and unfortunately the deck is stacked against us,” Rep. Sargent said. But the disparities do not end there. Sargent believes the disconnect between moderate and liberal Wisconsinite views on abortion compared to many conservative legislators is swayed by the powerful economic backing of life-affirming organizations. “There's a lot of money behind the pro-life policies and those folks get on the front lines and support people when they are running for office and help them win their races. Then when they get in the Capitol building, they are reminded of how they got there, and it has an influence on policies that are put forward,” said Rep. Sargent said. “So, what we see in the legislature are actually people who are a bit more extreme than the ordinary people in our communities, and that creates the disconnect.” During the 2018 midterm election, there were 37 Wisconsin candidates endorsed by the Pro Life Wisconsin Victory Fund political action committee who are considered 100 percent pro-life. Only six of these legislators were women.As the split government looks to vote on the upcoming biennial budget proposal by Gov. Tony Evers, pending topics surrounding general health care funding and the lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act will be debated.It is unclear how this will spark conversation or new legislation regarding Wisconsin’s stance on reproductive rights. However, due to the deeply rooted moral conflicts of this issue, it is likely that compromise is not nearby. “I think if we could get to a place of [doing] everything we can to support folks in preventing pregnancies they don't want to have, having healthy pregnancies when they do want to and getting access to termination as well as birth services,” Higgins said. “… That is a crucial part of the fabric of public health.” ",How the partnership of church and state shaped women’s reproductive rights,UWM

It is as simple as a mental change, and ladies, I invite you to ask yourself “What would Tammy Baldwin do?” or, “What would Mary Lansdchinger do?” Wisconsin is home to many women that you could emulate. Women who are changing the course of history, and who also happen to be from our own backyard. Tammy Baldwin You might already be familiar with Tammy Baldwin. What you might not know is that she is the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate. Baldwin chose to focus on issues like healthcare that are more representative of the people’s needs. Not only is she a smart, resilient and passionate politician, but she also encourages other women to be involved in politics and  well-informed citizens. Mary LaschingerFormer UW-Eau Claire Blugold Mary Laschinger is one of Wisconsin’s leading female CEOs, sitting as chief executive officer of a logistics company called Veritiv.  This born-and-raised Wisconsinite had an immense amount of willpower to go from living on a dairy farm all her life to owning the largest packaging and distributions company in the U.S.. Her bravery shows women that leaving your comfort zone and taking risks is the only way to succeed. Progress isn’t made when you’re staying the same and remaining comfortable. Greta Van SusterenIf there is one person we can count on to show us that you should never settle, it’s our very own Madison alumni, Greta Van Susteren. In 2016, Van Susteren was listed as one of Forbes’ “Most Powerful Women” for the sixth time. Although she retired from being a ground-breaking news anchor and commentator, she has since written a book and released her own mobile app. Van Susteren’s ambition is much of what we need in 2019. With the new year comes innumerable opportunities for women around the world. We cannot, however, wait around for something to happen — we must take control of our own lives. Throughout the year, I invite you to carry and embody this quote from Van Susteren with you: “I’m an Independent type. No one tells me what to do.”Marissa MayerMarissa Mayer not only conquered Mount Kilimanjaro in 2009, but she also recently became the CEO of a sinking ship: Yahoo!. Mayer unfortunately became Yahoo!’s last CEO, showing us that sometimes in life, you reach impasses and obstacles. She also demonstrates that difficulties are merely temporary, and they should never stop you. This Wausau, Wisconsin native recently launched a tech incubator business, Lumi Labs.It’s important to remember that everything will not always go the way we want, and that the beauty of life lies in its imperfections. In 2019, remind yourselves that overcoming challenges is part of succeeding. Gwen MooreRepresenting Milwaukee as a member of Congress, Gwen Moore is widely recognized for her confidence and tough character. Moore has battled through the troubles of her past and risen up to fight for what she believes in. She was a strong supporter of the Violence Against Women Act, as she herself was a victim of date rape sexual molestation as a child. Despite her horrific experiences, she never let it stop her from doing what she loved. She turned her struggles into her strengths and used her political platform to create change. By looking up to these women who defied the odds and ignored statistics, it encourages all women to take more risks. This year, embrace and embody Moore’s courage, Baldwin’s selflessness, Mayer’s relentless determination, Van Susteren’s independence and Laschinger’s ambition. Most of all, use your struggles, successes, failures and accomplishments to empower you and live for what you believe inEmpowering women starts with loving and believing in yourself like these women did, so in 2019, learn from these strong women, take risks, accomplish your dreams and don’t underestimate your own strength.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/01/hundreds-brave-cold-for-third-annual-madison-womens-march,"January 19, 2019 | 6:32pm CST","Several hundred marchers rallied on the steps of the Wisconsin State Capitol Saturday morning for the third annual Women’s March, despite snow and temperatures in the low teens. Happening at the same time as other marches in cities across the country, the event in Madison brought only a few hundred protestors, far less than the estimated 100,000 who packed State Street for the original march to protest Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017.Though only two years removed from Trump’s inauguration, Women’s March organizers chose to focus on other issues such as the continued attacks on Planned Parenthood and abortion rights, as well as the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. However, the event’s speakers still found things to celebrate — in particular the results of the 2018 midterm elections which brought record-breaking numbers of women into Congress.“Not only do I believe we’ve seen a change, I believe change is going to happen,” Rep. Shelia Stubbs, D-Madison, said. Stubbs became the first African-American woman to be elected to a state office from Dane County when she won in 2018. In addition to Stubbs, marchers also heard from speakers on the subjects of women’s health care, reproductive rights and safety. Amy Dean, communications director for Women’s March Wisconsin, spoke about problems with the health care system in dealing with women who are giving birth.“The United States has the highest rate of maternal mortality of any developed country, and we are one of the only countries in the entire world where that rate is increasing,” she said. “I am more likely to die in childbirth than my mother was. A black woman is three times more likely to die in childbirth than a white woman and it’s worse for Native American women.”Lorraine Shooter, a Native American activist from the Menominee Indian Reservation in northeastern Wisconsin, spoke about the increased levels of violence felt by women in the Native American community.“A Native American woman is six times more likely to go missing, be raped … than any other race. Native American women are also more likely to be murdered than any other race,” she said. “The original women of this land have very little justice.”Shooter said in the past three years, just under 14,000 Native American women and girls have been reported missing, a problem she said police are often unequipped or unwilling to deal with. “This is an epidemic that is going on in our homeland that gets almost no media attention,” she said. “The original women of this land have very little justice.”Though many in the crowd were students, people of all ages showed up in support of women’s rights. “Roe v. Wade is in trouble now,” said Marjorie Matthews, a member of the older women’s group, the Raging Grannies. “All the more reason why we really need to be protecting what still is before they take it away.”In addition to women’s rights, speakers also touched on other progressive issues like immigration and criminal justice reform. Rhiannon Plotkin, a 12-year-old whose mother was deported when she was an infant, told the crowd about the struggles of growing up without both of her parents.“This is not an easy thing for me to talk about, but this is not an easy thing to have to live with,” she said. “I feel like my country does not want me to have the same rights as my friends.”Rep. Stubbs, a former probation and parole officer, made criminal justice reform a central part of her campaign. “I can tell you firsthand what it’s like to place someone in our criminal justice system and I can tell you firsthand what it’s like to watch these families fall apart and be separated,” she said. “We cannot continue to incarcerate black and brown people at the rate that we are in the state of Wisconsin.”One reason for the lower turnout compared to previous marches may have been the controversy surrounding the leaders of the national Women’s March organization and their support of supposedly anti-Semitic and homophobic causes. In response, the organizers of the Madison march read a statement before the event condemning any form of hate, including anti-Semitism and homophobia. Madison School Board candidate Laila Borokhim, who is Jewish, said she had some reservations about speaking but decided to attend anyway.“I was not going to come here today … but then I remembered that not everything you see on social media is not actually true, so I’m here,” she said.",Hundreds brave cold for third annual Madison Women’s March,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/01/master-film-making-stellar-acting-makes-beale-street-great,"January 20, 2019 | 8:00am CST","Filmmaker Barry Jenkins received both critical acclaim and numerous awards including Best Picture at the Academy Awards for his 2016 film “Moonlight,"" an intimate and poetic exploration of one man’s alienation and struggle in a society he feels drowned in. Jenkins’ next film follows a completely different style, yet a similar theme. Based on the 1974 novel by James Baldwin, “If Beale Street Could Talk” has its heart in the right place the entire time, overall achieving what it sets out to do, yet struggles to execute its mission to its best ability.  Set in Harlem during the 1970s, young black couple Tish (Kiki Layne) and Alfonso/Fonny (Stephen James) struggle to deal with the various instances of interfering with their love. Fonny is in prison due to being wrongfully accused of raping a woman, causing Tish to go about with her daily life and Fonny feeling trapped in his cell, both without each other's emotional support. The driving force still connecting the couple is their unborn baby that Tish carries. In addition to their separation, the couple deals with the daily struggle of racism that plagued the 1970s — a time in which the civil rights movement was still fresh and racial justice was challenging to achieve.Jenkins' main goal as a storyteller is to stay true to Baldwin’s words and focus on the love story he crafted. While at times the couple feels too perfect and a little too in love, they have a deeply pure connection for each other that most couples can only dream of having. The on-screen chemistry between Tish and Fonny simply isn’t there compared to other romantic films that follow a couple plagued with chaos. Perhaps this is due to Jenkins forcing their love on us, painting too pretty of a picture and excluding the necessary drama to hold them together. While “Beale Street” deals with a heavy subject matter, the drama and emotion is lacking. The film is too quiet and pretty, with only two scenes truly grabbing you and giving you something to feel.What makes “If Beale Street Could Talk” work is how it is made. Barry Jenkins, being the visual artist he is as a filmmaker, crafts a truly gorgeous vision of Harlem in the 1970s and puts together a stunning film that will captivate the audience throughout. The cinematography captures the characters beautifully by expressing their emotions with detail and precision. The score generates a simultaneously haunting and charming mood to the film. Jenkins uses close-up shots to allow his audience to truly study his characters which helps us to become more invested in their journey from start to finish.The performances in this film are all stellar, each actor giving it their absolute best to portray people and not just fictional characters. Regina King is particularly memorable as Tish’s mother, whose motherly love and care for her daughter and her happiness drives her character into an emotional roller coaster. “If Beale Street Could Talk” is a strong film that generates emotional appeal, yet doesn’t fully embrace its dramatic potential. This film won’t move you or make you cry, but it will give you an appreciation for Barry Jenkins’ directorial vision and for the struggle of a couple who truly love each other. Tish and Fonny both go through gut-wrenching emotional stress that needed to be explored and expressed in a more intense and kinetic fashion instead of the calm, peaceful nature of the film, but from start to finish you’ll recognize you’re watching an emotional film from the eye of a master filmmaker.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/01/evers-takes-first-step-toward-bridging-partisan-divide-during-inauguration,"January 7, 2019 | 5:16pm CST","Gov. Tony Evers took his oath of office to become the 46th governor of Wisconsin, surrounded by hundreds of Wisconsinites and lawmakers who gathered at the state Capitol Monday.Latinx strings and gospel hymns joined traditional sounds of the 132nd Army Band of the Wisconsin National Guard to fill the rotunda in the minutes before five new state officials were welcomed in.  Evers, along with Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Attorney General Josh Kaul, Secretary of State Douglas La Follette and State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, were sworn into positions previously held by members of the Republican Party. Following eight years of GOP control that led to a $250 million cut to education funding and deductions to collective bargaining rights, the induction of these Democratic officials demonstrates a momentous shift at the state Capitol. Evers’ historically narrow victory over former Gov. Scott Walker last November was followed by a series of lame-duck legislation that hoped to limit Evers’ power as 2018 came to a close.“We have become paralyzed by polarity and we have become content with division. We have become indifferent to resentment and governing by retribution,” Evers said. “We have gotten away from who we are the values that make Wisconsin great — not Republican or Democratic values — but our Wisconsin values.”Kindness and respect are a few of the key principles Evers believes have been missing from the state legislature in the past few months. Acknowledging this deficit, he ignited a return to the most important part of Wisconsin: the people. Despite the GOP’s efforts, Evers promised this pushback would not compromise the backbone of his campaign platform, including the necessity for widespread health care, as well a more “sustainable solution” to fix and reshape transportation services. “I spent the past year traveling across our state talking about the issues that matter most to the people of Wisconsin,” he said. “We talked about what’s best for our kids is best for our state.” Kaul, who won his race against incumbent Brad Schimmel by extremely tight margins, openly rebuked last month’s lame-duck sessions during his acceptance speech. “That action, unprecedented in Wisconsin, and designed to hinder our ability to do the jobs our voters elected us to do, will have an impact,” Kaul said. “But I want to make clear that, irrespective of the actions of the lame duck legislature, the priorities of the Wisconsin Department of Justice are changing.” Those changing priorities include legislation that would prevent further rape kit backlogs, address the intensifying opioid epidemic and create universal background checks.As elected state treasurer — an office that was up for elimination last spring — Godlewski also acknowledged the recent attacks on state powers and democratic processes. “It’s hard to believe we almost lost this office, but we made our voices heard,” Godlewski told the crowd.As the first African American to hold the position in Wisconsin and youngest lieutenant governor in the country, Barnes will represent voices that have long been absent from state offices. He took a moment to honor Vel Phillips, the first woman and African American to hold a Wisconsin State Cabinet position and a fierce advocate for fair housing. Barnes, a Milwaukee native who grew up in the state’s poorest zip code — an area that also experiences the highest incarceration rate in the nation — said he seeks to further Phillips’ advocacy for statewide access to rights like clean drinking water and public education. “I intend to focus the office of lieutenant governor on the core principles of equity and sustainability because we have a responsibility to make sure that opportunities exist in every community across every corner of our state,” Barnes said. “A person’s zip code should never determine their destiny.”Together, Barnes and Evers mobilized a new generation of Democratic voters while also returning to long-standing progressive ideals like racial equity, accessible health care and strong investment in public education. “It’s about setting aside political interests and personal ambitions to work together on solving problems. It’s about putting people first,” he said in the final moments of his first speech as the governor of Wisconsin.  ",Evers takes first step toward bridging partisan divide during inauguration,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/10/continuing-the-fight-for-womens-rights,"October 29, 2020 | 9:00am CDT","Amy Coney Barrett’s recent confirmation as a justice in the Supreme Court is a paramount example of new leaders entering office with dismissive views on progressive topics, such as bodily autonomy. The conservative views that accompany these new leaders has made it even more difficult to progress as a nation and — more specifically — progress as a gender.There was a time when women had minimal rights. Even after the passage of the 19th Amendment granting voting rights, societal expectations of women stayed the same, leading to multiple waves of feminist movements urging society toward equal rights for women. Decades later, women’s rights issues are just as prevalent. As the 2020 election approaches, it seems as if our leaders are neglecting any progress made, instead moving backwards.People with uteruses have been scared for the protection of their reproductive rights for countless years. Unfortunately, those same people are waiting for the outcome of a terrifyingly hostile overturn of  Roe Vs. Wade that has been proposed by national Republican leaders. Amy Coney Barrett officially replacing Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Supreme Court, where conservatives lead a 6-3 majority, may have horrific effects on women’s rights. Roe v. Wade is a monumental Supreme Court decision that declared a woman’s right to an abortion as implicit in the right to privacy protected by the 14th Amendment. Before Roe v. Wade, many people with uteruses took abortion-inducing drugs that were advertised and sold despite the danger they posed. If Roe v. Wade is overturned like some politicians want, women in the country will be forced to resort back to fatal abortion methods in order to protect their own futures. The term “pro-choice” comes from the idea that if a person with a uterus becomes unexpectedly pregnant, they have the option to abort the child. That said, why are pro-lifers so adamant about demolishing abortion laws if they can make decisions about their own bodies? Why does nearly every pro-life argument involve religious beliefs? Some progressive Christians, like Jes Kast, a minister in the United Church of Christ and someone who serves on the clergy advocacy board of Planned Parenthood, argues that abortion “should be legal in all or most cases.” She continued, “there are no circumstances under which it is immoral to get an abortion.” Kast grew up in a Christian family where abortion was painted in an entirely negative light. When Kast matured, she began to view herself as a “Christian feminist,” and began to ask herself tough questions about the religion she preached. “I began questioning: What about bodily autonomy? Isn’t that justice? How would God ever infringe upon that?” She said. Christian groups have been consistently recognized for supporting anti-abortion laws and arguing the equivalence of abortion and murder. A church located outside of Planned Parenthood in Idaho is being sued for their frequent religious services that are intentionally held outside of a Planned Parenthood building. That church’s motive was to intimidate patients and staff members to sway them away from receiving a safe and legal abortion. Typically, Christians reference the Bible and the simple commandment of “thou shall not kill” to defend their pro-life ideals. If the Christian Justices that now dominate our country’s Supreme Court pass anti-abortion judgements, the First Amendment is entirely violated. Not everyone in the nation has Christian beliefs and Supreme Court members making a choice based on their own religious agenda is unconstitutional. Similar to Christian groups speaking out on an issue that is way larger than their religious sect, numerous male politicians have entered the reproductive rights debate. Congress has been predominantly male for years, which means the reproductive rights of people with uteruses in the country are determined by people that can’t even comprehend the struggles of living as a woman in a male-dictated society. In addition, people with penises have no laws that regulate their bodily autonomy. How is it fair for a gender that has no restrictions on their reproductive rights to make a decision that is completely irrelevant to their body? It isn’t. Planned parenthood is a major organization that supports reproductive rights. Advocacy to defund this organization has become extremely prominent as conservatives control courts and state legislatures. States that have access to Planned Parenthood have lower rates of teen pregnancy, STD’s and abortions. Planned Parenthood provides safety and care to people that have not always had the opportunity to feel like their bodily rights aren’t restricted. By defunding such a powerful organization, a threat is posed to people with uteruses who just want control of their own body, which, really, should not be a big ask.Just because a woman is in power does not mean her role inherently relies on feminist principles. Amy Coney Barrett, for example, has a long record of being hostile towards women's reproductive health and rights due to her Christian beliefs. Her actions directly oppose Justice Ginsburg’s evident passion for making sure women are protected and are able to make choices for their bodies.It is unfortunate that not all women use their power to build up other women, and instead inflict harmful notions inspired by religion. Amy Coney Barrett is known to be a devout Christian, and was even on the board of a Christian private school that tried to ban children of same-sex parents. It is rather horrifying that even in 2020, a leader with such anti-progressive views holds such a major position in our judicial system.Third term abortions have also been an argument that pro-lifers tend to spark up in order to prove their point that abortions are “murder.” In reality, these procedures are rare and are typically tragic situations where women face life-ending fetal diagnoses. Despite the fact that aborting a child within the third term of the pregnancy is due to fetal complications, some anti-abortion advocates believe that these women should still go through with the pregnancy and potentially die to save an already dying baby. Here in Wisconsin, there are some restrictions on abortion. Public funding is only granted in cases of life endangerment, rape, incest or when the procedure is necessary for the health of the birth-giver. Additionally, Planned Parenthood is not funded in Wisconsin, despite Governor Tony Evers campaigning on a promise in 2018 to restore Planned Parenthood funding. Wisconsin law prevents state or local tax dollars from being used to fund abortions, except in rare circumstances, making it difficult for women to easily receive abortions. It is a frightening time for women in the United States right now. As more conservatives are elected into judicial positions, more restrictions on women’s bodies are being discussed. Members of Congress continue to defund Planned Parenthood and restrict access to abortions. As a woman, I feel terrified as I continue to grow up and witness the people in congress doing everything in their power to terminate my reproductive rights. When will all people with uteruses feel safe and secure in a country that supposedly guarantees freedom regardless of gender? Now, it seems like my duty to be strong and stand up for the rights I know I deserve.Alexandra is a freshman studying communications. Is Justice Barrett’s confirmation a cause of concern for women? Do you think men should decide on abortion rights? Do you think decisions and laws should be made on religious grounds?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/10/amanda-nguyen-and-beverly-gooden-give-wud-lecture-on-survivors-rights-advocacy,"October 6, 2020 | 2:00am CDT","Amanda Nguyen and Beverly Gooden discussed advocating for rights for survivors of sexual and domestic violence as part of the Wisconsin Union Directorate’s (WUD) Distinguished Lecture Series Monday evening.The virtual conversation, presented over Facebook Live and YouTube Live, informed viewers of Nguyen and Gooden’s experiences raising awareness and how to advocate for and support those who have faced sexual and domestic violence. Nguyen, a 2019 Nobel Peace Prize nominee, is the founder and CEO of Rise, a legislative reform movement which works to empower citizens on how to put their rights into laws. Rise has helped pass 32 laws, including reforms on survivor rights and gun violence, since its founding in 2014.“The worst thing that happened to me wasn’t being raped,” Nguyen said. “It was being betrayed by America’s justice system. I think a lot of people realize that even if we go to the police and do what we’re told, the system is in heavy need of reform.”When Nguyen’s first bill concerning survivor rights in Massachusetts was up for a vote, she was notified before the hearing that the speaker was not going to bring up her proposal in discussion. She was discouraged from attending the hearing, and thought that the bill would not gain support without the mention of it in the hearing. She decided to still champion for her bill by visiting each senator and representative's office for 14 hours. Her bill was passed unanimously.“It isn’t over, and if you have a chance to fight for your rights, you can absolutely do it,” said Nguyen. “It is your constitutional right to.”Gooden expanded the global conversation on victim’s rights advocacy by introducing the #WhyIStayed hashtag to stimulate discussions between survivors over social media and has appeared on Good Morning America, The Today Show, CNN, TIME and The Washington Post. “I started to Tweet a few things about why I stayed and it turns out that a lot of people have that same story,” said Gooden. “From there I thought, what could I do that was tangible, what can I do to go offline with this activism? So my idea was to think about what was the most difficult part about leaving that relationship.”Gooden recalled how when she faced domestic violence, she had a difficult time leaving her ex-husband because she did not have the resources to pack up and leave. So, she created the Bolt Bag Project to empower survivors with the tools they need to leave domestic violence situations by providing toiletries, first aid kits and other essentials. “It was really difficult for me to make my bag,” Gooden said about when she first left her husband. “He never found it, but I didn’t want any other survivor to live that. I wanted there to be something that was just available to you if you need to get up and run.”Nguyen and Gooden encourage people to continue to support those who are facing sexual and domestic violence and to advocate for reforms in how the criminal justice system deals with cases of sexual and domestic violence. “Keep on organizing,” said Nguyen. “The story of change is a progress, is a shared story and no one is powerless when we come together and no one is invisible when we demand to be seen.”Resources are available for those who face sexual and domestic violence.

During the meeting, Prestigiacomo and Haasl laid out their campaign platforms, both emphasizing the importance of student involvement within local politics.They noted voter turnout in student majority districts has been exceptionally low, especially when compared to participation rates in other districts.“There are a lot of barriers for college and even high school students,” Prestigiacomo said.“I’ve witnessed so many opportunities where young people are passed up on due to their age, but young people have these out-of-the-box, sideways-thinking solutions that we need right now.”Both candidates have pledged to increase the local government’s student outreach, with Haasl specifically citing her involvement in a number of student organizations — such as the College Democrats — as an attempt to receive further input from her potential constituency.“Being a presence on campus is extremely important,” Haasl stated. “After all, what’s a better way to get to know your representative than to sit with them in class, ride with them on the bus or study with them at the library? This provides a unique opportunity that, if a student weren’t to be representing the student district, would be completely lost.”Prestigiacomo also shared he would not support legislation that would change the city’s common council from twenty part-time alders to ten full-time members, as this change would make it considerably more difficult for a student to represent District 8.Apart from student outreach, the candidates campaigned on a number of progressive policies focused on social justice and environmental issues.Haasl voiced her intent to expand the availability of mental health services and sexual violence prevention programs on campus, pointing to both as major issues facing students currently attending UW Madison.In regards to sexual violence prevention, Haasl cited the 2019 AAU survey conducted at UW-Madison that indicated 1 in 4 female undergraduates at the university would experience sexual violence while on campus — saying they were  “horrifying” and merited an expansion of services, such as the rape crisis center.  Prestigiacomo also promised to confront issues surrounding Madison’s greenhouse gas emissions, claiming he has already constructed a plan to help reduce the city’s environmental impact. “My plan for addressing the climate crisis involves addressing social inequities on campus and around Madison. You cannot have climate action without addressing issues of social justice,” he stated.Prestigiacomo, running unopposed for the District 8 Alder seat, easily secured his endorsement from the UW-Madison College Democrats. Haasl also obtained her endorsement with ease, as her opponent in the District 5 County Board Supervisor race, José Rea, was notably absent from the meeting. “I think an important part of aspiring to be a representative in a predominantly student district is showing up to student events and seeking out student endorsements,” Haasl said after the meeting. “I’m here because I want to talk to students and discuss the issues that are important to them.”","UW-Madison College Democrats endorse undergraduate students Max Prestigiacomo, Elena Haasl for upcoming local elections",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/02/top-25-films-of-the-2010s,"February 16, 2020 | 7:15pm CST","The 2010s was an extraordinary decade of cinema. Films were made that explored the deepest aspects of humanity, transported us to new worlds and re-envisioned how the art of cinema operates. We saw new worlds and explored the struggles of characters that made us more intoned with ourselves and the world around us. With that, let’s take a look at the 25 best films of the 2010s.25. Shutter Island (2010)Martin Scorsese’s most stylish picture, this thrilling adaptation not only features Leonardo DiCaprio’s best performance to date, but provides an unpredictable roller-coaster of a mystery filled with stunning imagery and a final act that will leave you speechless. DiCaprio’s performance as a troubled U.S. Marshall investigating the disappearance of a psychiatric patient from an insane asylum is a profound and thrilling look at mental instability and one sadly overlooked in the actor’s expansive career. 24. The Tree of Life (2011)Terrence Malick’s visionary work of art that explores both the cosmic and spiritual aspects of life and humanity may not be the most loved by audiences, yet this gorgeous masterpiece is one of cinema’s most extraordinary and existential explorations of life, told through the beautiful direction by Malick and spectacular cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki. 23. Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (2019)Avoiding a traditional narrative, Quentin Tarantino manages to express his love for Hollywood and cinema through a day in the life exploration of Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, a fading western TV actor, and his care-free stuntman buddy. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt deliver hilarious and iconic performances and are a cinematic match made in heaven, every bit of witty dialogue from Tarantino expressed perfectly, every scene rooted in the fun nature of their characters. Tarantino brings us back into Hollywood during 1969 and once again gives history his own spin, this time with the Manson Murders and Sharon Tate (played with pure kindness by Margot Robbie), giving the actress the ending she deserved and us an unforgettable climactic ending.22. First Reformed (2018)No film this past decade captured the growing hopelessness felt during the 21st century by so many people than “First Reformed.” Ethan Hawke is astonishing as the broken Reverend Toller, a lonesome pastor of a historic upstate New York church whose faith and perception on life is changed when a young woman comes to him concerned about her eco-terrorist husband with an unhealthy obsession of militant environmentalism. Paul Schrader’s brilliant script and nuanced direction take us into a seemingly hopeless world and subtly invites audiences to examine the world around them, making this film a truly unique and complex work of mastery. 21. JoJo Rabbit (2019)Out of all the films on this list, none is more unique than Taika Waititi’s blazingly original World War II satire “JoJo Rabbit.” Waititi’s ingenious coming-of-age tale about love and growth is not only a heartwarming testament to unity but a hilarious riot of satirical brilliance. This is the kind of film you laugh at one second, then cry at the very next, each second making you fall more in love with this truly one-of-a-kind masterpiece. 20. Roma (2018)Cinema at its purest form, Alfonso Cuaron’s beautiful passion project feels like a moving painting. “Roma” captures the essence of the human condition by following the life of a middle-class family in Mexico City through the eyes of their housekeeper Cleo, a tale largely based on Cuaron’s childhood. We feel the passion instilled in Cuaron’s beautiful direction and cinematography, the film becoming more and more breathtaking and emotionally captivating the deeper you get invested in this powerful story of love, family and loss. 19. Moonlight (2016)Beautiful in every sense of the world, Barry Jenkins’ exuberant exploration into one man’s alienated and isolated existence in three separate stages of his life is an intimate and universal visual poem of a film capable of moving audiences simply due to its gorgeous composition. Jenkins proves he’s a visionary auteur, capturing the harrowing feelings of loneliness and what it’s like to be outcasted by society. Mahershala Ali is incredible in his supporting role as Juan, a mentor to the protagonist Chiron at a young age who instills an infectious feeling of love onto us. The winner of the Best Picture award in which “La La Land” was mistakenly awarded, “Moonlight” is an American classic and a film that simply cannot be forgotten. 18. The Shape of Water (2017)Guillermo del Toro’s beautiful and unusual tale of a mute janitor at a research facility who falls in love with an Amazonian fish-man creature is a fairy tale layered with artistic depth and passionate storytelling. Del Toro reaches one of the best directorial achievements of the decade, each image more visually arresting than the next, the film engrossed in a classical style of filmmaking capable of charming even the most cynical of film viewers. Exploring what truly makes something a monster and the oppression so many different groups of people experience, few films from the 2010s are as magical as this work of art.  17. The Wolf of Wall Street (2017)Martin Scorsese’s electric true story of the sleazy stockbroker Jordan Belfort is one of the most entertaining movies of all time. Leonardo DiCaprio is on fire in one of the most off-the-charts demonstrations of this actor’s abilities, playing the most unlikeable snake of a human being and wowing us at every second. Scorsese, staying true to themes he has always explored, once again examines the nature of greed and American capitalism, his depiction of Belfort’s life a disturbing insight into what happens when money becomes one’s biggest obsession.  16. Room (2015)Every now and then a film comes along capable of moving you as you could never imagine. “Room” is that film. Brie Larson gives one of the past decade’s best performances as a woman trapped in an underground facility for seven years with her son who is the product of rape in a disturbing yet beautiful look at the love between a mother and son. Lenny Abrahamson brings this story to the screen with staggering beauty and powerful emotions, giving us more to feel and be in awe of than we can imagine. Not only is this a beautiful and emotionally uplifting experience, the escape scene in which Jacob Tremblay’s character escapes from he and his mother’s captor is one of the most heart-stopping scenes in recent film history. And don’t even get me started on the scene when he meets a dog for the first time. 15. Joker (2019)One of the 2010s most controversial films, “Joker” reinvents the comic book genre and explores the iconic Clown Prince of Crime through the eyes of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill and socially isolated clown-for-hire whose frustration leads him down a path of violence. Joaquin Phoenix is simply amazing as Arthur and the Joker, giving us insight into what living as a socially disenfranchised and mentally ill person does to the soul. Todd Phillips proves he’s capable of doing more than comedy by inventing a film that mirrors classic noir films, yet has his own unique vision instilled in every scene of this haunting and disturbing tour-de-force. 14. Under the Skin (2013)The greatest alien movie of all time, Jonathan Glazer’s mythical, soul-piercing insight into what makes us human is a film for the ages. Not only does this film feature a captivating performance by Scarlett Johansson, but every technical element of this film is mind-boggling, from it’s disturbing and poignant score, dark, haunting cinematography and stylish editing. “Under the Skin” sneaks up on you and manages to wow you at every step of the way, especially in its final act that will haunt you for days. Few films hit as hard as “Under the Skin,” and no other alien film has taken more risks and delivered such mesmerizing or profound results. 13. Whiplash (2014)Few films have wowed me more than Damien Chazelle’s electric debut feature, a kinetic take on competition and how far people are willing to go in today’s world to succeed. Miles Teller gives a revelation of a performance as a jazz student at a top-ranked music school, capturing the anxiety and drive of someone with a dream, and J.K. Simmons is ferocious and terrifying as his abusive instructor. “Whiplash” is a thrilling and insightful ride that will hit you harder than you can expect.12. Call Me By Your Name (2017)One of the best romance films of the 2010s, Luca Guadagnino’s beautiful and heartbreaking tale of first love is a testament to romance  and pure infatuation that everyone can relate to in some way regardless of gender or sexual orientation. Timothée Chalamet gives a soulful and breakout performance that will break your heart, carrying the film and making this an unforgettable love story.  11. Her (2013)The best romance of the 2010s, Spike Jonze’s profound and original exploration of human nature and the digitization of society and human interaction is one of the most refreshing installments in modern cinema. Joaquin Phoenix's tender performance as a recently divorced loner who falls for his technology operating system voiced by Scarlett Johansson allows us to see the world in different ways and gives us one of the most emotional and surprisingly believable love stories of all time.10. Boyhood (2014)No film last decade took more of a risk than “Boyhood,” who followed the same cast and crew over the course of 10 years to create one of the most authentic, true-to-life films the world has ever seen. Richard Linklater beautifully captures the various stages of adolescents through the eyes of a young man, depicting the family, social and personal struggles that erupt as we grow from an innocent child full of energy and wonder to a heavy-minded college student. Each scene reminds us of a time in our lives and captures everything joyful and harrowing of growing up in the 21st century, making “Boyhood” a truly special film.  9. Manchester by the Sea (2016)“Manchester by the Sea,” an absolute miracle of a movie, is a story that may not make you smile throughout but will leave you filled with more pure emotion than almost any other film I can think of. Casey Affleck gives one of the most powerful and profound performances of the 21st century as an emotionally broken man who, after the death of his brother, becomes the guardian of his teenage nephew, played brilliantly by Lucas Hedges. This is a film that captures some of the most realistic and unworldly acting you’ll ever see, most notably the sequence in which Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams discuss their broken marriage after running into each other on the street. While depressing and emotionally draining, “Manchester by the Sea” will charm you with Kenneth Lonergan’s storytelling powers and stay with you for the rest of your life. 8. The Master (2012)Paul Thomas Anderson’s monumental work of talent about a troubled World War II veteran who gets involved with a theological cult is as disturbing as any distressing horror film, not because of any blood or terror, but because of how it examines loneliness and the lengths we’re willing to go to feel belonged. Joaquin Phoenix gives what is simply to me the single greatest performance by an actor of all time as Freddie Quell in his fiery, nuanced, and emotionally raw portrayal of a lost soul. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives the best performance of his career as Lancaster Dodd, the cult leader who mirrors Scientology’s Elrond Hubbard. Anderson crafts his most cinematically beautiful film in this troubling yet important jewel that may come off as strange, but after thoughtful viewing becomes clear we’re watching the work of a mastermind. 7. Drive (2011)Grisly, electric, subtle, dark, beautiful, existential. So many words can describe Nicolas Winding Refn’s stylish noir thriller that takes a classic genre and applies stunning visuals and mesmerizing direction to turn it into something extraordinary. Ryan Gosling is one of the coolest characters of the 21st century as a Hollywood stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver for criminals and gets involved romantically with his next-door neighbor, falling into a trap as he tries to help her ex-convict husband. Featuring bloody and gruesome violence, Refn makes every scene beautiful and eye-catching regardless of what is occurring on screen. The film has an infectious style and graceful energy, its car-chase sequences some of the best in film history. Most notably, the elevator scene in which Gosling passionately kisses Carey Mulligan in slow motion while beautiful music plays before quickly turning to brutally kill a hitman with nothing but his foot is truly unlike anything you’ve ever seen. 6. Hereditary (2018)I’ve seen over 1,000 films. Not one has gotten more of a reaction out of me than “Hereditary,” the debut feature from Ari Aster. “Hereditary” is so terrifying and disturbing for so many reasons, but mainly due to how it intimately explores the horrific breakdown of a family due to their traumatic experiences. While the supernatural and cult elements are enough to scare you to death, Aster’s unsettling portrayal of how a normal family tips into chaos will leave you speechless. “Hereditary” hits harder than any film I’ve ever seen, filled with eerie music and a wonderful obsession for detail. Not only is this the best horror film of the 2010s or the 21st century, it’s the greatest horror film of all time and features one of the most chilling endings in cinematic history.  5. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)Martin McDonough brilliantly blends humor and heart in what would sound like a depressing story about a grieving mother who, after her daughter was raped and murdered, places three billboards up in her town that calls out the police department for not working hard enough in her eyes to find the killer. Frances McDormand is exquisite in the lead role as Mildred Hayes, capturing the feelings of regret and fury masterfully while also shining comedically. Woody Harrelson is good as always as Chief Willaby, whose conflict with Mildred turns into an unlikely friendship, but Sam Rockwell as the stupid, drunken, prejudice, yet morally ambiguous Jason Dixon is who makes this film so memorable due to the layered performance he gives as a lost man who struggles to let his true colors shine. McDonough’s story is one that both moves us and makes us laugh, a story about coming together and putting aside our differences to find common ground.   4. Birdman (2014)Few movies made us fall in love with cinema in the 2010s as much as Alejandro González Iñáritu’s cutting-edge dark comedy about a failed movie star known for his superhero role as Birdman who struggles to make a comeback on broadway. Michael Keaton gives the best performance of his career in this creative insight into a flawed individual and his relationships. Iñáritu shines as a director in every scene, Emmanuel Lubezki’s single take tracking-shot style of the film a mesmerizing cinematic depiction that wows the screen from start to finish. 3. Django Unchained (2012)Quentin Tarantino’s best film behind “Pulp Fiction,” “Django Unchained” took us into a world where Tarantino made the rules, not the history books. As he does in several other of his films, Tarantino bravely and boldly does whatever he wants to make this film as epic and exciting as possible. Jaime Foxx stars as the title character, a freed slave who, with the help of German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (a superb Christoph Waltz), hunts down outlaws and tries to rescue his wife from the brutal plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio in a viciously evil role). “Django” bleeds with style and creativity, a film that mirrors classic revenge westerns but one filled with soaring tension and intensity, the dinner table scene enough to give you a heart attack. Featuring hilarious comedy in a film about a slave may seem odd, but Tarantino’s powers as a director and writer are evident from start to finish. The shootout scene at Candyland alone gives this film a place on the list, being unquestionably the best movie shootout of the 21st century and perhaps of all time. 2. The Revenant (2015)Alejandro González Iñáritu’s revenge tale about fur-trapper Hugh Glass is as magnificent as movies get. Leonardo DiCaprio (in the performance that finally got him his Oscar) is unbelievable as Glass, capturing the struggles of man versus man, nature, and self with staggering intensity and emotion. Tom Hardy is just as impressive as John Fitzgerald, Glass’s fellow fur trapper, who, after Glass is brutally wounded in a bear attack, murders Glass’s son and leaves him for dead. Iñáritu puts you out in the wilderness with his characters and makes you feel every uncomfortable and painful detail that Glass encounters in his survival adventure. The film makes you feel connected with its characters and setting every step of the way, Emmanuel Lubezki’s cinematography appearing as if from a nature documentary due to its jaw-dropping beauty. 1. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)Many may find it strange that a film not known for its story but rather its visuals is number one on my list, but George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury Road” is unlike anything in the history of cinema, a visionary work of pure amazement. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are awesome in this intense post-apocalyptic masterpiece that feels like either a dream or a drug trip. Consistently entertaining due to its groundbreaking action and editing, Miller transports us into a world that seems both foreign and familiar, a warning for the dangers of authoritarianism and exploitation of our resources. From start to finish this is a fast-paced work of kinetic ingenuity, two hours of pure cinematic wonder and greatness and the single greatest action movie of all time. ",Top 25 Films of the 2010s,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/01/from-asm-campaign-to-state-legislation-suicide-prevention-hotline-to-be-added-to-wiscards,"January 30, 2020 | 8:00am CST","For UW-Madison students experiencing a mental health crisis next year, the number to call for help could be as close as the back of their student ID.A new bill passed in the state Legislature this month mandates all student ID cards for colleges and universities in Wisconsin to include phone numbers for suicide prevention hotlines. The bill has bipartisan support and only awaits Gov. Tony Evers’ signature. But the state legislation wasn’t the first UW-Madison heard of adding a crisis hotline to the back of Wiscards. Associated Students of Madison, the campus’ student government, already put the idea in motion thanks to a campaign started back in October. ASM Rep. Yogev Ben-Yitschak introduced the student council legislation at their Oct. 2 meeting after being inspired at a summer student government conference. Northwestern University students’ ID cards, which have multiple hotline numbers, made him realize adding similar numbers to Wiscards could work at UW-Madison. “It seemed like a campaign that [ASM] could really get behind in terms of what it was trying to do — I think ASM as a whole has been really trying to focus more on mental health this year,” Ben-Yitschak said. “This campaign fit very nicely in terms of making sure everybody knows where to reach out during a mental health crisis.”A University Health Services study reported 15 percent of UW-Madison students had thoughts of suicide in 2018; it is the second-leading cause of death among college students.The ASM legislation proposed adding a total of three numbers to the back of Wiscards: the UHS Mental Health Crisis Line, the UW Police Department phone number and the Rape Crisis Line. Around the same time ASM passed its legislation, the state’s bipartisan mental health task force recommended adding the suicide prevention hotline number to student IDs, Ben-Yitschak said. While he communicated with representatives about the progress of this suggestion, Ben-Yitschak also worked with UW-Madison “in case the state legislation [did] nothing else with it.”He added that the biggest challenge was not getting people to agree on the motion, but timely action.“Nobody was against [adding the numbers], but nobody was really taking the lead on it,” Ben-Yitschak stated. “It was mainly fighting against inaction of everybody saying, 'I support this, but do we really need to do this now? Can it wait another year?'” The campaign faced the most direct pushback at the student council meeting when it was first introduced.Other ASM representatives raised “a lot of really good questions” about whether the numbers could potentially be triggering, scare freshmen entering college for the first time or not be the best way to solve the problem, Ben-Yitschak said. At the meeting, Ben-Yitschak cited the state of California and other schools, such as Northwestern University and Ohio State University, that already mandate similar emergency numbers on the backs of their student ID cards. And research doesn’t support that adding the numbers causes harm to students, he added.The UW-Madison Faculty Senate and Academic Staff Assembly both passed resolutions in support of ASM’s campaign to add the three phone numbers to the back of Wiscards. The support from all the campus’ shared governance groups encouraged both the university and the state representatives, Ben-Yitschak said. After the state legislation passed in the Senate, UW-Madison was “ready to move” on the project, said Director of the Wisconsin Union Mark Guthier. A team of people led by Guthier — including Ben-Yitschak and other representatives from ASM, UHS, UWPD and the Wiscard office, with input from UW Communications and UW Office of Legal Affairs — will spend a little over a month redesigning the backs of the Wiscards to fit the suicide prevention hotline. Although the bill only requires the suicide prevention hotline, Ben-Yitschak is still aiming for all three numbers from his original ASM campaign to end up on the IDs. The inclusion of the Rape Crisis Line and UWPD’s phone number will be discussed at the design meetings, but Ben-Yitschak doesn’t think it will be too difficult to get the other two numbers approved. Guthier agreed, as he previously approved all three numbers and believes the team will too.“We're happy to help make it work, however many can fit on the back,” Guthier said.The bill also allows for the substitution of a local suicide prevention hotline. Ben-Yitschak stated the group may decide to swap the national hotline for the UHS Mental Health Crisis Line.The goal is to redesign the Wiscards in time for Student Orientation Advising and Registration, when incoming freshmen typically pick up their ID cards. In order to do so, the design needs to be finished by the March 15 deadline, according to Ben-Yitschak. At the moment, only incoming freshmen will be receiving the new Wiscards, Guthier said. Students will also be able to get one of the new ID cards if they lose theirs and need a new one printed. Since Wiscards are printed on demand, the redesign will not add any extra costs for students or UW-Madison. Ben-Yitschak said he is proud of how the campaign has grown — from a way to help students who aren’t able to search emergency hotline numbers online to a broader way to show support for people struggling on campus. “It's symbolic in the sense of we're telling our students that we know this is an issue, and there is always help for them if they need it,” he said. “This is [our] way of saying we're here for each other and the university is here for us — that we're willing to change our design so that students have the resources they need during whatever they're going through.”",From ASM campaign to state legislation: Suicide prevention hotline to be added to Wiscards,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/11/q-a-juliana-bennett-speaks-on-affordable-housing-chamberlain-rock-backlash-and-student-engagement,"November 16, 2021 | 3:07pm CST","Madison has long had a unique political relationship with the student body of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with students making up roughly 17% of the Madison population as well as a considerable majority of the eight aldermanic district.Over the past several decades, the District 8 alder has worked to represent the often progressive and relatively radical viewpoints of students, encouraging other local representatives to take more drastic positions along the way.The current District eight alder chair is occupied by 21-year-old University of Wisconsin-Madison student and community activist Juliana Bennett, who has continued the tradition of advocating for progressive change in local policy. Alder Bennett spoke with the Daily Cardinal to discuss her role as a student serving in public office.How would you describe your position as an Alder, and what role do you play in connecting campus to the larger Madison community?There are 20 districts in Madison that make up that city council. The council is split up among 20 districts to meet the specific needs of Madison residents. In my case, I represent district eight which is mainly made up of undergraduate students and young people, and has been over past about 40 years. District eight has traditionally had a student representative, which is unique from the other alders who, normally, are older residents. We, as students, are a vital piece to Madison. When people think about Madison, they think about the Capitol and they think about the university. One out of every six Madison residents are students, and we live here for nine months out the year where we are contributing to Madison's economy and general culture. So it is really vital to have a student representative on Common Council to voice the concerns of students. That's what I'm there for... I generally serve as a liaison between the city and Madison and UW Madison students. It is extremely important for students to engage with their local alder because when the general population thinks of politics, they think about national policies, the president and the House and Senate, maybe some even consider their state representatives. People are really focused on that. But it's really on a local level that effects how the policies or laws and regulations enacted by the federal and state government are carried out. Also, people have greater access to local representatives... it's important to engage with your representative because if you have any problems, for example, with your apartment, like your sink is broken, and the landlord hasn't fixed it, you can call me and I will get it fixed — simple issues like that. During this past year, there was an especially low turnout among students for the election of the District 8 aldermanic chair. What do you think are the main causes for the low rate of student participation in local elections? I think part of it is, like, a lot of students are either registered in their home city or they feel as though they aren't a part of the greater Madison community, when in reality, we should be thinking about it like “we live here nine months out of the year, we should have a say about what the city offers on a local level.” I think part of it is also students just not knowing when local elections are going on. Obviously, there could be more campaign outreach getting students to know that there's a local election going on and for helping students to get their Voter IDs and registration, because that's a big issue as well. It's really frustrating…There's also issues with polling places and, especially in my election, COVID played a big role. All of the polling places were in one concentrated area which was a long walk to do after a long day of school for anyone not in the area, like anyone that lives in the Lakeshore Campus dorms. It's just things like that which compound one after the other after the other, and make it difficult for students to vote.During the past year, some local activists seem to have become disillusioned with the idea that government is able to implement institutional change that meaningfully policy in a way that benefits the community. How would you respond to these frustrations?To people who feel this way, I would just like to say that your frustrations are completely valid. I've been pretty loud with my observations with some of our local leaders who are advocating for change. It can be frustrating working with 20 other people, some of whom don't want any change and some of whom want to go backwards. I will say, if you're a Madison resident who wants change, your frustration is completely valid.What do you feel is the biggest issue facing residents of District eight today?Affordable housing, hands down. It's absolutely ridiculous that students are paying upwards 70% AMI to live in Madison. It's absolutely ridiculous that we have to face increasing rent on top of the burden of student loans; it just adds on more debt. How is there any upward mobility? Nothing quite affects students like housing because when you don't have housing, it becomes extremely difficult for you and others to operate just as a person. So I would say that the top issue is affordable housing. You advocated for the removal of the Chamberlain rock due to its' association with a racist nickname. Following the removal of the rock you faced public outcry, including death threats, as a result of your advocacy. Would you care to walk us through your experience handling this volatile situation as a public official? I mean, honestly, I've avoided speaking about it publicly, because it was so it was traumatizing. The whole thing put me in a really dark place … It was horrible. I was quoted in the papers — my quote got spread around to ABC, CNN, Fox News and sites like Breitbart, etc. So I had people calling me, texting me on my personal phone number and emailing me on my city account. All of my social media received messages, some of which, I had to call the authorities about because they were physical threats and acts of violence. Most of them were just people saying, “f*** you,” and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But some were like, “you n-word, you deserve to be raped,” that fucking stuff… Yeah. I guess I don't want to give too much air to it. Because I know a lot of those comments are just made to elicit a reaction, and it just shows how necessary it was to remove that rock. It just goes to show the psychology of racism is alive and well, and how it affects people. So if you're not a Black person, and you don't know what it's like to be called the n-word, you have no right to saying anything about that rock.","Q&A: Juliana Bennett speaks on affordable housing, Chamberlain rock backlash and student engagement",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/10/white-feminism-and-the-media,"October 21, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","The word feminism can elicit reactions ranging from unadulterated hatred to unyielding pride, depending on who you ask. It can conjure images of suffragettes with hands thrown in the air and brazen expressions plastered on their faces. It can be a source of power and a derivation of selfhood. Yet — at the other end of the spectrum — the word can invoke imagery of brash women who like to complain about unfounded injustices. It can be a reactionary discourse on how, “women have the same rights as men now.” I identify as a feminist; I think everyone should, contentious as the identity might be. But there is an undeniable problem with feminism in America and many western countries: it has historically and almost ubiquitously been associated with white women, by both the media and the dominant culture. Whether it was Susan B. Anthony or Lena Dunham, many have framed feminist advancements with women who look like them, and this is more than a lack of representation. This issue runs deeper than slipping the word intersectionality into speeches about women’s rights. Women of color, specifically those of lower economic standing, being excluded from the narrative, the conversation and the movement has dire consequences. When Sarah Evervard was murdered, London came together to grieve the loss of yet another woman taken at the hands of gender-based violence. Communal anger sparked stories of keys tightly gripped between knuckles and pepper spray held in clammy hands. Women had one common experience: fear. Sarah’s story begs the question: Why is walking alone at night a death sentence? The circumstances surrounding Evervard’s murder spawned outrage and horror at the systemic harassment women face on a daily basis. In proving the inequitable attention given to women of color, little regard was given to the murder of Sabina Nessa, a schoolteacher of Bangladeshi descent. The same holds true for the unexplained drowning of Blessing Olusegun, a Black business student. Both of these women received a fraction of the public outcry which Evervard’s did, despite both hailing from London. But then again, when caucasian Gabby Petito went missing in Wyoming, headlines blazed. Her name became household in a matter of days. Authorities acted quickly, her remains were found and her family was given an answer.Countless Indigenous families in the Wyoming area are still waiting for that answer. They are left wondering what happened to their missing daughters, and why both public and legal attention seems to be muted. No, it’s not a competition. The murders of Sarah Evervard and Gabby Petitio highlighted severe issues surrounding rape culture, abuse of power and violence against women. Their stories mattered and their lives ended in tragic, inhumane ways. Nevertheless, it is irresponsible to not discuss that women of color — in identical circumstances — are disproportionately unacknowledged.It’s about where society, and subsequently the media, place its value, and it has become increasingly clear that agenda is exclusionary. According to the Wyoming Statewide Report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous People, “Only 30% of Indigenous homicide victims had newspaper media coverage, as compared to 51% of White homicide victims.” For Indigenous women, that number drops to 18%. It is not that white women don’t deserve attention, safety or public outcry. But seeing the media and justice system consistently disregard the kidnappings and murders of women of color, one can’t help but wonder why some lives seem to be assigned more worth. The difference in the treatment of the Sarah Evervard and Gabby Petitio cases in comparison to the deaths of the women of color confirms this: women of color are not afforded the same protection as white women. Perpetually viewing feminism through a white, middle-class lens only continues to propagate this negligence.As feminists, we need to examine ourselves. Subconsciously, do we view white women as more precious or valuable? Do their deaths create more unease in us? More sorrow? When we speak about feminist issues, is intersectionality a division rather than a backdrop of the movement? A Black woman is both Black and a woman, and neither identity should be stripped because of the other. Yet, women of color are rarely at the forefront of gender or race movements. Their voices and their unique experiences are rarely highlighted. The feminist movement in the western world has long needed a change. It is time for the mainstream movement to shift its focus towards providing support and empowerment for all women. It is time for the mainstream movement to have uncomfortable conversations about power structures within the movement itself and to break down who we give authority to. We must be willing to bring to light the disparities that exist within feminism. The feminist movement is the key to giving women of color the same public and legal attention as Sarah Evervard and Gabby Petitio and —through this attention — we can work toward ending the culture of violence to which women, as a whole, are subjected to. Priyanka Vasavan is a freshman studying marketing and finance. Do you agree that feminism being centered around white women plays a part in the lack of justice women of color receive?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/five-stars-on-the-hand-a-tank-top-to-match-for-moxie,"April 1, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","From “Parks and Rec” sensation to now director and critically acclaimed actress, Amy Poehler recently adapted the book “Moxie” into a Netflix original. Starring as the accomplished single mom to Vivian, a young junior in high school. The movie came out March 3, with a soundtrack of 90s alt rock feminist bangers and received a 68% on rotten Tomatoes with reviews highlighting its “on the nose” message and how it was right on time. The plot goes as follows, Vivian has to start writing college application essays and has a prompt about “what she cares about.” After looking at it for a bit she moves on and later asks her mom what she cared about as a teenager and she replies “SMASHING the patriarchy.” A bit perturbed, Vivian decides to look through her moms stuff and finds a suitcase full of old pictures and writings from her mom and her friends and also feminist article clippings. Before watching her ask her mom, we got a scene of the new girl, Lucy, arguing that the “Great Gatsby” is just another book by a white man about white men being entitled. Upset by this, the antagonist of the movie, Mitchell, a star football player who is the epitome of being anti-feminist, attacks her saying that there's a reason we still read the book and that she should get over it. Later, Vivian sees Lucy being threatened by him and after reporting harassment to the principal and being ignored, Lucy tells Vivian off for telling her to ignore him. After school that day, Vivian digs into the Suitcase and decides to start Moxie, a handmade mini magazine about women's rights. After distributing them in all the bathrooms, chaos ensues. Whew. That plot summary took a bit didn’t it? Stay with me. Notably, this movie is about high school students, and so as a college student I felt a small disconnect and definitely a small twinge of panic at seeing a college application being filled out, am I right? However, it is the target demographic for social change to start in our current world, as in high-school students and the movie influences most girls and assigned females at birth , as they begin to experience these issues for the first time with a sense of consciousness so it fits. The strengths of this movie in addressing the issues of modern feminism include its subtle support of intersectionality, which depending on who you talk to is good and bad. Overall, it supports the idea that women of all sexualities, races, ethnicities, experiences and possible transition states deserve a voice in the feminist movement. Featuring a white lead, but with little other main character white casting, as well as showing girls from different backgrounds such as Vivian's friend, whose mother is a first generation Asian immigrant who wants her daughter to not get in trouble and go to college, this film showcases a story that relates to every girl. Other notable examples include Lucy, a person of color  who is the most outspoken of the group, another  girl and a possibly Latina girl, as well as Jose Totah, who is a trans girl in real life, as CJ. The movie even features a kiss between two of the girls at a party, further enveloping the full spectrum of women. The movie even shows how easy it is for men to split up the movement among women subtle but dividing these groups. The patriarchy likes that women don't want to work together, and he’s been known to support and propagate infighting within feminist communities since its conception. With a speech made from Mitchell about how he's being “bullied by the girls’ and how “they're being mean to him” and then the resilience of the girls, who are so young and still get this basic concept, stick together and don’t change their redomiciliation of the school due to some cat fight of disagreement about how the movement should progress. The overall triumph is more important than individual micro issues, and the patriarchy is the enemy, not other girls. Like in STEM where women are pitted against each other to be the best instead of competing with the men around them. As far as the words said in the movie, pretty much every modern issue within the movement is brought up, even subtly. The main features include dress code requirements, which prompts the protagonist to organize a tank top wearing protest, the idea that male athletes are favored over females and also receive more academic claim and protection from punishment. It also combats the judging of women's bodies and slut-shaming in its portrayal of the school's “ranking” system. Without spoiling anything, it also touches on rape culture, and how men are over-protected in this regard, even by female principals who simply wish to keep the “peace.” This is a delicate topic and this movie handles it well, choosing not to feature any actual scenes with an implied rape. The implication of rape comes out in the climax of the movie and is the tipping point in finally convincing the principal that there’s a problem. The girl is supported following her confession and is not slut-shamed at all or told it is her fault. Also, her fears of not knowing whether to say anything or not are thankfully invalidated in that no one tells her off for incriminating someone. The last thing that impressed me is that Vivian has a genuinely good male love interest. He supports the movement and treats Vivian well, giving the prototype for how men should react to these issues and concerns. Feminism means equality for all, not men over women, and in giving more perspective, he is the male lead that any man watching this can relate to and learn from as well. Also, he is not just doing the bare minimum either, which so often gets propagated. Overall, although I’m sure there are some nuances that I’ve missed, and bald spots in the representation I didn’t even think of as an AFAB of english descent, this movie did a great job. Although I initially found the acting cringe and in fact almost set it down after 10 minutes, I soon was hooked and stayed up way later than I planned to finish it. Amy Poehler did a fantastic job with this movie and it saddens me that movies like this still need to be made. But, hopefully in releasing content like this, things will improve. So, go watch “Moxie” and draw a star on your hand in support.","Five stars on the hand, a tank top to match for 'Moxie'",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/02/candide-an-ever-relevant-timeless-classic,"February 18, 2021 | 9:35am CST","“Everything happens for a reason.”How often have we justified some misfortune we’ve encountered with the above statement? It is, most certainly, helpful in blocking out the pain inflicted by the misfortune we faced, albeit only on a temporary basis. Perhaps such a supposition is a good thing that helps us recover from the blows we are dealt with. But what if we applied this extensively to each and every situation we found ourselves in or witnessed or read about?We would be blinding ourselves to the grave injustices of the world and providing justification for the unjust, when instead we should be acting to change things. Such a line of thought is best exemplified by philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz’s theory of the “best of all possible worlds,” where he essentially argues that God created this world and since God is almighty, all knowing and perfectly good — omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent — he chose to create this world we live in. There is one single world among infinity that, according to God, is the best of all worlds and that must be the world we live in. This then justifies the evil and injustice present in the world today as a necessary part of this “best of all worlds” that we must just accept because it fits God’s plan.I certainly do not intend to question anyone’s faith and it may be easier to dismiss or cope with some of our experiences using this argument but upon expanding our scope of thought, it becomes hard to dismiss each and every hardship every person on Earth faces as just a consequence of this being the best of all worlds.French philosopher Voltaire sought to refute this argument in a rather unconventional manner; by writing “Candide” in 1759, a satirical rejection of Leibniz’s theory.The book is a comical third person account of the experiences of the eponymous protagonist Candide — the name can be translated from French to mean “innocent” or “simple” — and how he faced a raft of hurdles and unjust experiences that changed his worldview and helped bring forward Voltaire’s own points of view. Candide is the illegitimate son of the Baron of Westphalia’s sister who grew up in the Baron’s castle and studied under the tutelage of Pangloss — a name that roughly means “all tongue” in Greek and is a nod to his babbling nature — a philosopher character in the story described as a “professor of metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology” that appears to mimic Leibniz. Candide imbibed the “best of all worlds'' view from Pangloss, as he fell in love with the Baron’s daughter Cunegonde. Everything seemed to go to plan as they kissed, but it all came crashing down as they were caught by the Baron. Candide was expelled from the castle — after all, a commoner and a Baron’s daughter wasn’t a pairing viewed with positive light — and he found himself alone for the first time, equipped only with Pangloss’ teachings. This marks the beginning of his journey towards rejecting Pangloss’ views. Candide suddenly found himself amongst the Bulgarians, who enlisted him as part of their army but as he left camp for a mere brief walk, he was carried to a dungeon by four soldiers and brutally flogged for desertion.After witnessing a gruesome war between the Abarians — a tribe of Tartars settled on the shores of the Danube — and the Bulgarians, Candide traveled to Holland and found a helpful Anabaptist that took him in. Soon enough, Candide found a sickly beggar on the streets and to his amazement, it was Pangloss. Pangloss told Candide he had contracted syphilis and Cunegonde and her family had been murdered by the Bulgar army. Despite all this, the optimistic attitude stuck and Pangloss was taken in by the Anabaptist as well. The three of them then traveled to Lisbon by sea, where the Anabaptist drowned.Upon arriving in Lisbon, Candide and Pangloss faced an earthquake levelling the city. When Candide asked for wine and oil after being wounded by falling stones, Pangloss ignored him and continued trying to justify the sufficient reason for the earthquake until Candide fainted. This exchange could be viewed as a criticism of philosophers like Leibniz who try to find a neat explanation for adversity, often in the very face of adversity itself.Pangloss eventually found himself sentenced as a heretic and hanged, while Candide — who was sentenced for listening with approval to Pangloss — was flogged yet again. An old woman tended to his wounds and then, to his surprise, took him to Cunegonde, who was alive after all. Cunegonde was now a sex slave who had barely evaded death but Candide was overjoyed to see her alive and proceeded to kill her owners. Candide, the old woman and Cunegonde now fled to South America by sea. During this journey, the old woman documented her harrowing past of rape, enslavement and cannibalism, only adding to the list of already harrowing events that would be justified under Leibniz’s theory and according to Voltaire, shouldn’t be.They arrived at Buenos Aires, where the governor Don Fernando proposed to Cunegonde, scuppering the plan Candide and Cunegonde had made to marry each other. She accepted the governor’s proposal to protect herself, while Candide found a valet named Cacambo and eventually found himself in the land of Eldorado, a utopian country with gold and jewels on the streets, no conflict and no courts, to name just a few things. A true “best of all worlds”. As tempting as it was to stay, Candide wished to return to Cunegonde after a month and took with him countless jewels from Eldorado and headed to Suriname. He sent Cacambo to purchase Cunegonde from Don Fernando and meet him at Venice, while he plotted his path to Venice. He then dealt with a merchant named Vanderdendur, who stole much of his fortune. Yet another misfortune that befell him and he found himself questioning his optimism. He sailed off to France with another scholar, Martin, who disagreed with Candide on his optimistic Leibnizian world view — perhaps as an extension of Voltaire himself. Vanderdendur’s ship had been sunk by the Spanish on the way to France and Candide could recover some of his fortune. He proposed this as a sign of justice in the world that backed his world view but Martin disagreed.Candide and Martin made their way from Paris to Venice. In Venice, they met several characters that were very dissatisfied with their lives in the “best of all worlds.” Candide then found that Cacambo had been enslaved by a deposed Turkish monarch — along with the old woman — and then they headed to Turkey to buy Cacambo’s freedom. In Turkey, Candide found Pangloss again. He had managed to survive the attempted execution but faced further misfortunes before ending up in Turkey. The group soon found and freed Cunegonde — who had grown old and ugly — and the old woman too. Candide and Cunegonde married each other and the entire expanded entourage now settled on a piece of land that they farmed and maintained. Pangloss now conceded that he did not believe in his own previous optimistic conclusions. As they found themselves engaged in work, there was no time for philosophical speculation and everyone lived happily ever after. Summarizing this whole whirlwind journey is necessary to understand the flaws in an entirely optimistic worldview. It clearly papers over cracks by ignoring the inherent flaws of human nature, the pursuit of power, the silencing of dissent and the mistreatment of people. For its time, “Candide” is critical of religious extremism, wealth and slavery. After all, if activists believed that the evil in this world was justified like Leibniz did, we would not see the massive strides made in the treatment of those previously subjugated.Looking at the movements sparked in 2020, it becomes imperative to reject Leibniz like Voltaire did. An optimistic worldview does not induce change but neither does mere philosophical speculation. At the end of the book, Candide talks about cultivating one’s own garden. This is an excellent thought, for I think it implies that we should first make changes at an individual level rather than concerning ourselves with speculation, optimism or macroscopic matters. Such an approach would help fight compassion fatigue and still result in active change through a domino effect. Blind optimism leaves us blind to a subpar existence that the status quo profits from, but changes from a grassroots level involving those near us can lead upwards to macroscopic change.Whatever your takeaways may be from ""Candide"", it is a humorous, compelling and rather simple philosophical text and truly a classic still relevant today.","Candide: An ever-relevant, timeless classic",UWM

League of Women’s voters.  “He just burst into our weekly meeting carrying about 10 ultra-thick crust pies from one of the restaurants he used to own. He yells, “Who wants to taste my thickness?’Chang said after the peace offering, the group welcomed him with open arms. “It dawned on me: a man this kind and charitable would never commit sexual harassment, not in a million years,” she said.Cain took the time to sit down with the League chapter for dinner.  “He was such a gentleman, really nothing like the way he’s portrayed on CNN and MSNBC,” said Abigail Weinstein, an 87-year old member of the League. “At the end of the meal, he asked me what I was up to later that night.  I told him I was going home to play Mah-Jong with my husband.  Poor Mr. Cain just looked so upset and let down.”On Tuesday, Cain turned up during lunch hour at the Center for Gender and Race Equality in Colorado Springs, Colorado.“Of course none of us could even believe what was happening,” CGRE receptionist Patty Kozlowski said. “Admittedly, I was a visibly miffed that he only brought pepperoni-where was the vegetarian option?  Anyway,Cain was very apologetic about it.. He took my phone number down so we could have a more ‘private’ conversation about the matter.”However, Kozlowski said she never received an official call back, but was contacted by some “creepy random Blocked ID guy who breathed rapidly into the phone and then just abruptly hung up.”In an attempt to garner some of the youth vote, Cain brought his “Pizza Party Presidential Campaign” to the campus sorority circuit. Candy Williams, vice chair of Alpha Chi Omega at Brigham Young University, found the presidential hopeful to be a “total charmer.”“After all the bread sticks were gone, when everyone was leaving the room, Herman pulled me aside and asked if I’d stick around a little longer- to split a bottle of non-alcoholic wine. I was so down!” Candy recalled. “But then he saw my promise ring and ran out the door. Weird. I am still totally voting for him, though.”",Fake News Friday: Cain apologizes with pizza,UWM

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer migrants who are deported face additional concerns of abuse and injury when detained before deportation.In fleeing conflict and abuse at home, these migrants run into unanticipated danger and harassment by authorities in detainment, Chávez said.“It is important for a broad, human rights and LGBT-oriented program to account for the extensiveness of detention in incarceration systems inside and outside prison walls, and who they impact the most,” she said.In traveling across Africa and Asia, photographer Kelly Doering’s experiences spoke to those of individuals attempting to navigate collisions of differing cultural perspectives of sexuality.Doering’s time among friendly and tolerant Ugandans as a homosexual living in rural Uganda contrasts with the image Uganda presents via its Parliament’s “Anti-Homosexuality Bill” that would make homosexuality punishable by either death or life imprisonment.“You can meet people who are part of that blanket, but you also meet individuals who are not that way,” he said.LBGT Global Rights/Issues was held as part of the ongoing LGBT Global Rights & Issues Week sponsored by International Student Services, the LGBT Campus Center, University Housing’s Diversity Squad and the Departments of Chicano and Latino and Gender and Women’s Studies.",Academics talk about globalization of LGBTQ issues,UWM

More recently, the emergence of seasoned businessman and political newcomer, Herman Cain has given the race a fresh perspective. He shines a new light on a election cycle usually dominated by politicians’ recycled ideas. However, Cain has little experience besides his previous successes as an influential businessman, including his position as CEO of Grandfather’s Pizza and his experience as the head of the National Restaurant Association. His inept political experience and outlandish societal deductions suggests he should not be president of the United States.Undoubtedly, Cain maintains a navigable distance from the typical Washington mold. His background in business and collegial studies in mathematics and computer science are not typical among Washington’s elite. Many Americans, no doubt conservatives, have voiced interest in a businessperson, rather than a banal Washington politician with a peculiar political agenda, running the White House.At first, the prospect of an African-American, conservative businessman making America’s tough decisions seemed as exciting as it was unlikely to certain GOP loyalists and Tea Party sympathizers. Yet, a closer look at Cain’s ideas and agenda display his scathingly impractical ideas of what it takes to be the leader of the free world.Akin to many conservative thinkers, Cain advocates for the “unbundling” of education “from the federal government down to the local level,” according to his campaign website. A supporter of both charter schools and school vouchers, Cain’s ideology on education draws parallels to a business model, where school districts “reward” teachers whose students excel through “performance initiatives.” Although history shows that people generally work harder if promised an increased monetary reward, pitting teachers against other teachers via a merit pay system “destroys the collaboration and teamwork that are essential to the culture of the school,” according to Diane Ravitch of New York University. A recent experiment conducted by Vanderbilt University offered middle school math teachers up to $15,000 bonuses for student achievement and concluded that, apart from some “temporary” gains for fifth graders, the vast majority of students did not progress any faster than the teachers who did not receive some form of monetary reward.  Although he vows that it worked in New Orleans in a post-Katrina environment, Cain’s treatment of education as a “business model” has been proven impractical. With a seemingly simplistic and now infamous idea of taxation, his flat nine percent income, sales and corporate tax would effectively end the IRS and repeal the Sixteenth Amendment.  His past remarks, though later retracted, stated that he would not nominate a Muslim to his cabinet if president. His belief that the science behind global warming is “poppycock” and his proposal to build an electrified 20-foot tall fence along the U.S.-Mexico border uncover his sparse, unrealistic and negligent ideas about America. Fortunately, the past week or so has shown that the fiery businessman’s presidential bid may be in trouble, as recent sexual harassment allegations from multiple associates reveal the troubled waters ahead for Cain’s campaign. I’ll admit that it’s hard to not respect Cain’s straightforward candor. It’s certainly nice to have a candidate who wants to bluntly address the issues at hand. However, Cain is not politically well rounded, and his ideas from the business world do not necessarily transfer to the political realm. Although, with the Iowa Caucus still two months away, the actual Republican race is just beginning, and Cain’s train still has time to lose or gain steam.Ethan Safran is a freshman with an undeclared major.

We love it because we feel grown-up and because it’s fun to get paid. But we hate it because with employment (in the modern sense) comes a whole mess of mind games and power dynamics. Many of us have put up with bosses that treated us with indifference, with disrespect, with contempt. We tolerate this treatment for two main reasons. First, we’re worried about what might happen to us if we quit. Jobs are often difficult to come by, and a decision to stay in an unhealthy work environment can be based on very practical concerns.I would argue that more often than not our teeth-gritting has more to do with internalized power structures which place our employers on a pedestal above us. A pedestal which makes ours brains jumpy and our hands clammy, and which forces us to endure harangue, harassment and humiliation with our tails between our legs. It’s important to note here that this dynamic can even occur with good bosses. The loyalty to your employer is less artificial, but it still is rooted in a deeply hierarchical power dynamic, in which you are expendable and your boss is in control.What I’m trying to demonstrate is that quitting your job or even voicing your discontent takes a lot of self-possession and nerve (even in the worst circumstances). Confronting authority, both the external authority of your boss and the internal authority you’ve bestowed upon him or her, is no easy task. It often takes a catastrophe, like sexual harassment or blatant exploitation, to  quit.What is true in this micro scale should be true for the macro scale as well. An economic system is a composite of endless interactions and decisions we make as we go about our business. The choices we make are what makes our society more or less prosperous, sustainable or just. And just as we passively internalize the rigid hierarchies of a workplace, we yield to what we’re given in terms of societal norms and values. We float along with the tide, numbing ourselves to the inequities and aggressions embedded in our culture just as we train ourselves to repress our resentment of the impotence, the disenfranchisement, of our modern workplace. There are many slaps in the face, and for many of us these slaps are growing stronger and harsher and more frequent.You have expectations of your government, your financial system, and your community. And either you have lines, beyond which transgressions will not be tolerated, or you don’t. If you don’t set up tripwires for these entities, you run the risk of being taken by surprise when your government becomes an autocratic police state, your financial system becomes a mechanism the wealthiest people in our society use to stay the wealthiest people in our society, and your community lets you fall through the cracks. Either you will tolerate this, or you won’t. I think it’s likely you don’t think you would.But on the other hand, our government now makes a regular practice of imprisoning activists on no charge, either by association or for intimidation. Our financial system, after greedily rotting the global economy, is back on track even as it supports austerity programs around the world. One in four Americans live in poverty. And the collective response is indifference, disrespect and contempt.Draw your lines in the sand, both for your own life and for your society, and then hold your ground.Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.","Hold employers, society accountable by being willing to quit",UWM

There is also a lack of cultural understanding of LGBTQ people in health-care systems.PRIDE in Healthcare also aims to provide a social forum for LGBTQ students and connect them to practicing doctors who are accepting of LGBTQ cultures.“I think it’s important to have an ally in your doctor,” Spence said. “[Discrimination] is an experience I don’t want anyone to have to go through.”Spence, who came out in high school, said his doctor neglected to provide him with information about LGBTQ issues, which led him to believe his doctor’s office was not a “safe space” for him to be openly gay.“There was no [sexual information] provided for gay-specific relationships, so there was a lot of confusion,” Spence said. “I received misleading, inaccurate answers [on the Internet] to things my doctor should have easily been able to answer.”According to Lehman, past experiences or stories LGBTQ people hear caused them to fear general medical care.“The health-care system doesn’t know how to engage [with LGBT] because they are an invisible population,” Lehman said. “Getting over that invisibility has to be key.”",Student group to raise awareness on LGBTQ health care,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/04/21-jump-street-a-successful-commentary-on-the-recent-past,"April 8, 2012 | 7:35pm CDT","YEAR 2005—so begins this year’s cinematic reimagining of the ’80s TV series “21 Jump Street” that launched the career of Johnny Depp. We open on metal-mouth-clad Jonah Hill donning a pair of those ridiculously, impractically baggy jeans from the turn of the (21st) century that have been all but forgotten in favor of their hipster antithesis, skinny jeans.His hair is bleached and cropped short in homage to Eminem and the outfit is made complete with a metal-ball necklace and a plain white T-shirt. This timid high school incarnation of Hill is subjected to a now-clichéd scene of verbal torment from a letterman’s-jacket-sporting jock (played by Channing Tatum, who demonstrates unexpected comedic chops) and labeled “not-so-Slim Shady.”This vignette instantly ushered in remembrance of an earlier time in my life, a mixture of both what high school was actually like back then as well as the contemporary clichés Hollywood relied upon. I realized that this was perhaps the first blatant attempt I had seen on film to appeal nostalgically to millennial high school memories—and it was fiendishly successful.While the original property aired before most of Madison’s current student population had even set their eyes on a television screen, this lack of familiarity does little to impede Generation Y-ers’ appreciation for the present-day film. This is because “21 Jump Street” is far more than a simple cash grab plucking at the nostalgic heartstrings of Generation X-ers who grew up watching the show.I myself have not seen a single episode of the original, and doubtlessly missed plenty of the film’s inside jokes as a result, but was treated to a hilarious and surprisingly thought-provoking meditation on how youth culture has changed since the early aughts, a time that feels much closer than our Internet-facilitated culture’s rapid acceleration of change would suggest.Upon arriving back in high school to pose undercover as students in an attempt to take down a deadly new drug ring, despite being somewhere around 24 years old, Hill and Tatum quickly realize the rules of cool they were weaned on no longer apply.Tatum’s 7-miles-to-the-gallon vintage muscle car is scoffed at next to cool dude Dave Franco’s (Yes, James Franco’s younger brother) bio-fueled ride. Harassing someone for his or her sexual orientation is quickly established as taboo. Hell, even liking comic books is hip. Frustrated with his sudden shift to dinosaur status, Tatum calls out what he sees as the source of the problem, screaming to the cafeteria at large, “Fuck you, ‘Glee’!”So far, we millennials have suffered through innumerable remakes, rehashes and reincarnations of cultural properties from the youths of the Baby Boomers and Generation X—after all, this summer we can expect to see Liam Neeson yell some iteration of “You sunk my battleship!” in Peter Berg’s cinematic take on the classic ’60s board game.But how long until Hollywood starts seriously digging into our own scrapbook of nostalgic cultural memories in order to stoke the box office flames? How far off are modern cinematic incarnations of “Goosebumps,” “Boy Meets World” and every other fond memory from our adolescence? Nickelodeon has already launched a bid for our hearts by returning classic shows of our childhood like “All That,” “Doug” and “Rugrats” to the airwaves, and Cartoon Network isn’t far behind.Perhaps it’s the product of our incessant cultural connection through the Internet, allowing us to indulge our every nostalgic whim—be it downloading an old episode of “Rocket Power” or finding that timeworn commercial for Fruit-by-the-Foot—but Generation Y certainly seems to be shaping into a generation particularly fond of indulging in childhood nostalgia. Given modern Hollywood’s fondness for sequels, prequels and remakes, the two seem like a match made in heaven.I just hope that when my adolescent reminiscences are trotted out on the silver screen once more, it is done with the wit, charm and insight of “21 Jump Street.” A certain level of self-awareness couldn’t hurt either. After all, as Ice Cube yells at Hill and Tatum, ostensibly describing the revived undercover program the two will be working in, “The guys in charge of this stuff have no creativity or imagination. All they do now is recycle shit from the past and expect us all not to notice.”Thankfully this remake was thoroughly imbued with creativity and imagination. I can only hope the same for the inevitable cavalcade of reboots to come.Got a favorite childhood show David forgot to mention? Do you love orange soda more than “Kenan & Kel”?

In 2010 Weinstein was able to convince the MPAA to overturn its NC-17 rating for the Ryan Gosling/Michelle Williams relationship drama “Blue Valentine” when the ratings board got up in arms over a scene of Gosling performing oral sex. This year the board would not budge on its decision to brand the documentary “Bully” with a cursed “R” rating for “some language,” deflating the hopes of many that the documentary could be a rallying point for raising awareness of the horrors of relentless adolescent harassment among kids themselves. One teenage bullying victim even started a petition for a PG-13 rating on Change.org which has already racked up almost half a million signatures.In retaliation, Weinstein has announced he will be releasing the film for an “unrated” theatrical run without any attached rating from the MPAA. While technically legal, it would be an unprecedented move and how theater owners would treat such a release has yet to be seen. But one man is already behind Weinstein’s plan one-hundred-and-ten percent: Nicolas Cage.The man of a million movies has had more than a few of his own frustrating fracases with the MPAA over the years, and he’s finally ready to “Kick-Ass” and take names. Harvey’s “for the children” plea has resonated with Cage to such an extent that he has decided to execute “unrated” theatrical releases of two of his own family movies that have been toiling on the shelf after being slapped with ratings that Cage maintains are outright ludicrous.“The Easter Bunny”In the wake of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s boxoffice bonanza with “The Tooth Fairy,” Cage aggressively pursued the prospect of a sequel to the timeless chronicle of a professional hockey player who becomes a tooth fairy after being mean to some children. But as Cage discovered, the tooth does indeed hurt. He was passed over for the role in favor of the chameleonic Larry the Cable Guy, who was glowing with critical praise for his role in “Cars 2” that has been widely regarded as the seminal voice acting performance to be found in Pixar’s catalogue. Never one to give up the fight, Cage produced his own family film in a similar vein—“The Easter Bunny”.Cage plays the grumpy owner of a pet store specializing in rabbits who, after yelling at a group of children in the store for trying to play with some of the animals on Easter Eve, finds himself sprouting whiskers, growing white fur and defecating colored Easter eggs uncontrollably as he is tasked with teaching the children in his neighborhood the true meaning of Easter. Originally the MPAA refused to award “The Easter Bunny” a desirable rating because it featured “vague sexual references, brief scenes of holiday-related violence, ambiguous racist language and gratuitous human egg laying throughout.” However, Cage now plans to release the film in theaters unrated on Easter weekend, explaining that he feels children everywhere could benefit from the film’s message of belief in the mystical in our modern day techno-dystopia.“Alvin and the Chipmunks: Take Me Down to Munky Town”Before “Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked” offered audiences a nautical conclusion to the beloved trilogy of anthropomorphized-rodent adventures, a different final installment was produced with Nicolas Cage in the lead. While the movie was originally intended to film in Nashville, Cage insisted the production be moved to New Orleans in order to accommodate his quest to procure new additions to his collection of antique human skulls.Unfamiliar with the concept of renting property, Cage purchased the infamous LaLaurie Mansion, regarded by locals as the most haunted residence in New Orleans. That’s when things took a turn for the worse.In an interview with Variety, the film’s director bemoaned that Cage spent the majority of waking hours during production “holed up in a hidden security room in his new home watching as he tortured the staff into believing the house was haunted with a myriad of technical tricks.” He concluded, “Is Nicolas Cage a maniacal Jigsaw-esque sociopathic sadist? That’s not my business. What is my business is securing the best possible performance from my actors and I feel like Mr. Cage’s extracurricular actives may have been interfering with his work in this case.”Whoever was ultimately to blame for the lackluster results, 20th Century Fox ultimately decided to take the series in a different direction after the final cut failed to secure an acceptable rating from the MPAA for featuring “Possible innuendos, pervasive anti-Arizonan sentiments, mature sexual situations involving shadow puppets and constant scenes of irresponsible chipmunkery and intoxicated revelry.” However, Cage recently reacquired the rights to the film from Fox using funds from the sale of his backup Scottish castle and plans to release the film for an unrated theatrical run this summer, telling The Hollywood Reporter that “Summers need blockbusters, that’s just how it is. And it was tragic that those fascist rodentophobes didn’t want children to learn from this tale of regret, redemption and why you should never mix an ‘82 Mouton Rothschild, Fleischmann’s Gin and a Styrofoam cup of jumbo shrimp gumbo.” How family audiences will receive this debaucherous romp through the French Quarter with Cage, Alvin, and the gang remains to be seen.",APRIL FOOLS': This family film has not yet been rated,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/11/us-house-needs-to-pass-the-enda,"November 5, 2013 | 11:02pm CST","Monday night, the Senate passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which makes it illegal for an employer to fire or not hire someone due to his or her sexual orientation and/or gender identity. The passage of ENDA marks a significant milestone for the LGBT equality movement. Nevertheless, the Heritage Foundation’s Ryan Anderson and many other conservatives feel differently. Anderson stated ENDA is “bad policy” because “ENDA would create special privileges based on sexual orientation and gender identity.” ENDA ensures that as many as two-thirds of LGBT individuals do not face employment discrimination in their respective workplaces and that the third of men earn less than their similarly qualified heterosexual male counterparts earn the same. Ensuring all people are rewarded for their hard work rather than exogenous factors is by no means a ‘special privilege.’ Anderson complains that ENDA would “impinge Americans’ right to run their businesses the way they choose,” but Anderson forgets that the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law. Surely, ensuring LGBT folks are treated the same as their heterosexual counterparts supercede the rights of businesses.88 percent of Fortune 500 companies prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, but only a quarter have the same for gender identity. 88 percent of Fortune 500 does not include the tens of thousands of the many small businesses that do not extend these same rights to their workers. No person, no matter where they work, should have to live with the fear of being fired or harassed because their employer disapproves of how they choose to live their personal lives. ENDA provides a guarantee this will not happen. One of Anderson’s erroneous remarks is that ENDA would discourage job creation. ENDA would actually increase job creation and productivity. An American Civil Liberties Union report found that passing ENDA would increase business output by $1.4 billion per year due to creating less hostile work environments for LGBT workers.The true reason organizations like Heritage do not support ENDA is because they see this legislation as destroying the “traditional values’” they hold so dear. Just because the values of someone else are not theirs, does not make that person’s values unworthy. While the Senate passage presents a significant achievement, unfortunately, House Republicans will continue to be the least functioning Congress ever by not allowing a vote on ENDA. Wisconsin was the first state to pass a fair employment act, which banned discrimination based on sexual orientation. This legislation was passed in 1982 with Republican Governor Lee Dreyfus, signing the bill. Dreyfus comment on passing the legislation should resonate with House Republicans and the likes of Anderson who oppose the legislation, “It is a fundamental tenet of the Republican Party that government ought not intrude in the private lives of individuals where no state purpose is served, and there is nothing more private or intimate than who you live with and who you love.” ENDA should have an opportunity to stand its ground in the House.Please send all feedback to opinion@dailycardinal.com.",US House needs to pass the ENDA,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/04/minimalistic-speech-and-debate-wows,"April 17, 2013 | 12:27am CDT","With a slightly unconventional subject matter, “Speech & Debate,” a play by Stephen Karam performed last weekend by The Undergraduate Theater Association, was an impressive actualization of the troubles adolescents find themselves confronting on the grounds of their identity and place in the world. Featuring a cast of only four and a minimal set, this show tells the tale of three unlikely classmates joining together for a multitude of reasons, finding themselves in the process.Diwata is unique and awkward—a perfect representation of an unsure teen in a relatively small town. Her life goal is to be an actress, but she settles with starting a speech and debate club at her high school to kick her career off. At the start of the play, she makes a video blog complaining about her drama teacher at school and his clear lack of appreciation for talent. This vlog, which is a recurring event in the play, also involves some wonderful drunken singing and piano playing.One of the viewers of her blog, Howie, is a new student at Diwata’s school. Feeling lost in his new environment, he decides to start a Gay-Straight Alliance, but recruits no members due to the conservative climate of his town. Upon finding Diwata’s vlog, Howie comments claiming to have secret information about the teacher. From there, a fiasco unfolds in which Solomon, a fervidly liberal writer for the school paper, attempts to address the issues of sexual harassment by authorities using Howie’s and Diwata’s information. The three come together under unusual circumstances and begin to appreciate each other in new ways. Through the power of confrontation and empathy, each comes to terms with their own past, present and future.There were very few downfalls to this performance. Each member of the small cast shone in their own way and accurately depicted the high schoolers trying to figure out exactly who they are. Diwata, played by Claire Zhuang, was absolutely the star of the show. Her quirky personality was the perfect mix of teenage awkwardness and adult confidence. Her witty lines and comedic songs meshed well with her overall demeanor, which was displayed through her adoration of Mary Warren from “The Crucible.” The sarcasm of the character contrasted the blatant honesty of a teenager struggling to recover from a bad experience in her past and move on with her life to achieve her dreams. Though Zhuang had a few slight line mishaps, they fit with the character and her erratic nature.Solomon, a character of solitude and drive, finds himself surprisingly lost in his situation, an important characteristic that is well communicated by actor Aaron Heaps. His serious demeanor is often broken down with whining and complaining, but is also matched by strength in his conviction and a need to avoid self-confrontation. His secret looms over him every day, another trait often referenced with body language and harsh commentary.Cody Kour portrayed Howie with a true understanding of the character and a great talent for silent communication. While Howie seemed full of himself at some points, at others the character's presumably shy nature overtook the confidence otherwise demanded. However, his tacit understanding of situations truly brought out the message of the show—growing up is hard and confusing, but confidence in oneself and drive will pave the way.Overall, “Speech & Debate” was a wonderful coming of age tale. A heavy story with light comedy, this show brought an extremely realistic sense to what could have easily been an over performed work. ",Minimalistic 'Speech and Debate' wows,UWM

With the decision from the Supreme Court this past summer and the backlash following the Religious Freedom Act in Indiana earlier in the year Republicans have been fighting a losing battle when it comes to LGBT rights.  With 59 percent of American citizens supporting same sex marriage, Republicans are showing just how out of touch they are with everyday people.  The Wisconsin Assembly has been the latest target for discriminatory legislation.  Several weeks ago, Rep. Jesse Kremer (R-Kewaskum) introduced Assembly Bill 469, an attempt to restrict transgender use of gendered restrooms in schools.  Regardless of how Rep. Kremer and the other supporters of this legislation may spin it, this bill is an attack against the transgender community and LGBT Wisconsinites as a whole.Rep. Kremer and the other supporters of the legislation hide behind false goals. Supporters say that they are trying to protect children from possible predators and any other possible dangers.  The fact of the matter is there have been zero reported cases of transgender individuals attacking or sexually harassing anybody. What this bill really does is delegitimize thousands of young transgender students in the state.  Going through transition can be one of the scariest experiences a young transgender individual can face. They must worry about hormones, the changes happening within their body, not to mention the sadly inevitable pushback they’ll experience from their community. A transgender person must push past these obstacles in order to try and live a happy life.  Now, on top of all these variables, Wisconsin Republicans are trying to make trans bodies illegal and accuse transgender people of being “bathroom predators”.  They would rather stigmatize transgender students than help them.  Instead of offering positive options for the community, they just want to tell them that they are wrong.  This legislation will cause incomprehensible psychological damage to transgender students.  It tells them that they are wrong for wanting to be who they truly are.We do not live in a world devoid of prejudice, and the LGBT community has faced far more than its share of prejudice.  History is full of names such as Matthew Shepard and Brandon Teena.  In 2015 alone, there have already been 24 trans women murdered. The numbers may be even greater due to the lack of hate crime reporting by police officers in cases involving trans individuals.  The trans community lives in constant fear not only for acceptance, but for their lives.  Legislation like AB 469 gives the green light to violent prejudice.  It tells those with hate in their heart that being transgender is wrong and punishable.  Transphobia strengthens every time laws like this pass.We need to stand up to Rep. Kremer and the other Wisconsin Republicans who are trying to police trans bodies.  They can no longer repress the rights of same sex couples to marry, so now they are moving that repression to the trans community. They label the trans community as predators and try to ban them from the public eye.  We need to send them a message that the people of Wisconsin choose equality over hate.  We need to speak out against injustice when we see it otherwise Republicans will continue to destroy all of the progress we have made for the LGBT community. LGBT people are citizens too. Stop trying to police our bodies and destroy our rights. Join us on Thursday, November 19 at 10 am in room 417 North in the Capitol to tell Rep. Kremer and the other Republicans about the lasting and significant damage this bill will have on the young people of Wisconsin.Danny is the LGBT Caucus director of the College Democrats of Wisconsin, and a junior majoring in history and political science.

John Jagler, R-Watertown, said the bill is necessary to start a dialogue on the “startling” rise of students taking remedial classes, which students must take if they perform poorly in the standard class.“We need to get people to start asking questions about why kids aren’t ready so we can reverse these trends and give the UW System and schools some knowledge,” Jagler said. “I don’t know why this data doesn’t already exist.”The proposal passed on a unanimous voice vote.The Assembly also passed a bill Tuesday which would allow the state Department of Transportation to raise the speed limit to 70 mph on some highways.“This is a safe, simple bill to understand and we will let the DOT decide who will go what speed,” state Rep.

But the most revolutionary representation, to me, is the way they depict Ilana and Lincoln’s non-monogamous relationship and break-up. It’s such a realistic depiction of modern dating, through all of its complications.Since the pilot episode, Ilana and Lincoln have had a very open and honest non-monogamous relationship. They both respect each other’s boundaries and keep an open line of communication between the two of them. As Lincoln says in the pilot episode, “I saw your tweet, so I wanted to stop by, but wanted to respect your space, so I’m hanging back.” They’re always transparent with their needs and desires. Ilana is seen throughout the show having multiple other partners besides Lincoln — both men and women — yet we never see story arcs dealing with jealousy between the two of them. It’s probably one of the healthiest depictions of a romantic relationship on TV.Last season, in the eighth episode, “Burning Bridges,” “Broad City” completely devastated fans when Lincoln broke up with Ilana. He sits her down and tells her that he wants to be exclusive with Steph, the other girl he’s been seeing. Ilana is taken aback, but remains composed until she asks him if they can still be friends, to which he responds, “I don’t think we’re just friends. So, no.” Ilana is really upset by this and, throughout the episode, goes into a spiral, telling herself that she’s not allowed to be upset since they weren’t exclusively dating one another. This continues until the very end, where she finally breaks down and cries it out on Abbi’s shoulder.This episode rung so painfully familiar for me and I’m sure many others out there who are active participants in the casual dating scene. Defining relationships with labels or being exclusive is becoming more and more rare — which isn’t a bad thing at all. I thoroughly enjoy casual dating. But sometimes it makes us feel confused when we “break-up” with each other. Just because you weren’t dating in the technical sense doesn’t mean you didn’t sincerely love and care for that person. It’s totally normal and okay to feel upset after the two of you end your relationship. Seeing Ilana break down in the same episode made me shed tears, something I never expected from an episode of “Broad City,” but I was just so relieved to see someone else going through emotions I and so many of my friends have gone through. It assured us all that there’s no need to feel silly for being upset over the end of a casual relationship.The show has gone forward with this story arc into the new season as well. In the third episode of the most recent season, “Just the Tips,” Ilana runs into Lincoln for the first time since they ended things. She doesn’t handle it particularly well — she actually poops in her onesie. And in the following episode, “Mushrooms,” after a failed threesome with an incredibly attractive couple — Ilana’s dream — she takes the leap and unfollows Lincoln on all forms of social media so she can move on.So not only is “Broad City” showing that it’s okay to be upset when your casual relationship/hookup ends, it’s also showing that it’s okay to take some time getting over it. Feelings don’t just magically end when the relationship does. Often times we try our hardest to ignore our feelings, especially while seeing someone casually, but who says that casually dating someone and having feelings for them are mutually exclusive? I just want to say a big thank you to “Broad City” for shedding some light on modern romance and making me and my emotions feel valid in a dating culture that can be overwhelming at times.",‘Broad City’ tackles the complexities of casual dating,UWM

Halfway across the country, there was a piece of the world that seemed almost fitting. A program that extends far beyond its years, First Wave and the Office of Multicultural Arts continue the fight for diversity. Constructed on three pillars of arts, activism and academics, First Wave strives to be impactful both on the stage and in the classroom.The mission has always remained the same. With performances like SOAR during the summer, the mission grows with campus climate. The Center for the First-Year Experience (CFYE) and First Wave have repeatedly created conversations that are centered around the idea of race, privilege and oppression. The topics that continue to dictate our daily lives are brought directly to us before the beginning of our freshmen year. In preparation for the shift outside of high school, SOAR and its First Wave interns change the dynamic of what and how interactions can alter our perception of ourselves and those that do not resemble us. There are layers in and outside of the 20-minute performances that have continued dialogue as we see how the inclusion of people and place continue to be affected by time and circumstance.There is never an end to a performance. For myself and the other 13 members of my cohort, the battle has no end because it applies everywhere else ... SOAR is the middle ground between us and how we handle the spaces we occupy. Breaking into groups afterwards truly shows how impactful, physical presence applies to the state of knowing and asking. As an incoming freshman at the time, I learned how quickly I can be wrong and how easy it can be to forget the vital reasons for programs like SOAR—programs that exist and extend beyond registering for classes. SOAR stands on its own as a way to prepare incoming students for the journey ahead that may not always have their best interest in mind, or other times, when that journey forgets we’ve been walking the same trail, too.UW-Madison’s campus climate faces issues that are not solely limited to race and diversity. First Wave and its SOAR interns have also been cautious in their approach at talking about other issues such as depression, anxiety and sexual harassment. The level of concern for an individual in any given environment, whether a classroom, a party or an event, asks us to respect and acknowledge the ability and potential of physical, mental or emotional harm. For a program like First Wave to establish themselves in a space that forgets us much of the time, we build bonds long after the performance has ended. SOAR reminds us to reach a new common goal, establish conversations to ask why and always reach new potentials within our understanding of outside communities. SOAR has taught us that the ability to understand and reflect on the differences that shape us are the reasons why we shape UW-Madison.",SOAR for the Summer: First Wave in and outside of the classroom,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/02/jakes-take-rondo-hayes-and-social-media,"February 1, 2017 | 9:58pm CST","A day after the Chicago Bulls’ loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday, Rajon Rondo felt compelled to respond to the criticisms levied onto the team by Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade in the wake of the defeat.As detailed in his latest Instagram post, Rondo was apparently incensed that Wade and Butler vented to “the media” after the game, as they criticized the team’s effort and execution vs. Atlanta.Rondo had a right to be upset with Butler and Wade for their public critiques of the team, as one can certainly argue some things are better left in the locker room. That leverage, however, was forfeited when Rondo responded to his teammates in an equally public fashion.Rondo’s criticism of Butler and Wade speaking to “the media” follows a common trope among athletes that reporters are not to be trusted, and therefore it is likely that the former Kentucky guard was feeling betrayed by his teammates.Sure, Rondo didn’t vent his grievances directly to reporters, but he did post it onto an account with more than 600,000 followers, so let’s not pretend that he acted much differently from Wade and Butler. He responded publicly to a public criticism.Rondo’s view of social media and “the media” as separate entities is interesting, but ultimately is misguided and outdated. There’s nothing stopping reporters from visiting his Instagram account and transcribing his post just like they would in a post-game press conference. Rondo needs to realize that a journalist’s capacities now expand far beyond pen and paper and in-person reporting.Both were surely talked about on Twitter, in newspapers and on blogs, as both incidents featured honest and open dialogue from athletes. “The media” does not discriminate based on the medium of communication used.Rondo’s Instagram rant, while well-worded and eloquent, is the type of event that can divide a team, and the type of act one would expect more from a petulant rookie than a 30-year-old veteran.Why then, does it seem like these types of inciting, controversial posts are less common among college athletes?Perhaps it’s the fact that they are more obedient to their coaches than pro players, or aware that controversial posts could harm their future job prospects. Either way, we are unlikely to see Nigel Hayes calling out his teammates anytime soon on social media.Generally, I believe there is often a shift in college athletes’ social media personas once they have a more secure future, whether that is transitioning to the professional level or working in another field.Aside from the likely strict posting rules that the NCAA enforces on its athletes, college athletes generally act cautiously online, merely posting about upcoming games, expressing their gratitude toward fans and playfully engaging with teammates.People who divert from that narrative to talk about more serious subjects, such as Hayes with the Black Lives Matter movement, are praised for their courage. Whereas those who share more crass, unfiltered beliefs, like former Mississippi guard Marshall Henderson, gain viral notoriety.This reaction to outspoken college athletes shows that there is a certain expectation on how college players should act on social media, as they are often nudged toward an agreeable, understated online existence.Ultimately, there is nothing wrong with a safe, vanilla social media account, and there’s also nothing wrong with one that addresses more contentious topics such as racism, police brutality or sexual harassment.There are currently more than 460,000 NCAA student-athletes from all walks of life. Why should we expect them all to act the same?","Jake's take: Rondo, Hayes and social media",UWM

The amount she will earn matches the eight-month equivalent of her full-time salary, and she will receive full benefits.On Dec. 6, when the Board of Regents were to discuss termination or disciplinary actions for an unnamed chancellor in a closed session, Kopper tendered her resignation in a one-sentence letter to Cross. The discussion item was removed from the agenda and Cross sent her the exit agreement later that day. “I am aware that the Board of Regents would like different leadership for UW-Whitewater and thus I hereby tender my resignation as Chancellor effective Dec. 31, 2018,” she wrote in the letter.The resignation was not a shock to many students due to the sexual harassment investigations of Kopper’s husband, Alan “Pete” Hill, and allegations that she created a hostile work environment for her peers. As a longtime critic of Kopper’s treatment of employees, Nass shared his feeling with UW System President Ray Cross, who accepted her resignation and sent her the exit agreement. “As we face the increasing possibility of a recession next year, there will be taxpayers that may lose their jobs in 2019 but be expected to pay taxes and tuition for their kids to finance a former chancellor doing almost nothing for eight months,” Nass said.Mike Mikaelsen, Nass’ chief of staff, searched for answers as to why the system decided to pay her, despite being strapped for funds. ""This is something that reminds the public that they’re not short of cash and frankly that there’s a constant refrain, there’s this ongoing image, one after another, of different administrators who have been in these circumstances or made bad decisions and the university has had to deal with them,” he said. Kopper is to remain at the university as a tenured psychology professor, to which she will be paid $118,308 in a nine-month teaching contract for the upcoming 2019-’20 academic year.","State Senator calls UW System, UW-Whitewater chancellor exit agreement a 'scam'",UWM

She noted a record year of fundraising and retention as well as her pride in students and staff. ""Serving as your chancellor has been an honor and a privilege,"" she wrote. ""I have devoted my life to teaching and learning and making a difference. That will never change.""She did not oversee winter commencement this past Saturday, and faculty said she was not seen on campus since Wednesday. In her absence, Provost Susan Elrond stepped in at graduation, as is customary for the provost to fill the shoes of the chancellor if they are unable to fulfill their duties. In September, a UW-spokesperson revealed that Kopper had no plans to resign at the time.Throughout this semester, Kopper was pushed to resign due to the accumulating sexual harassment allegations of her husband Alan “Pete” Hill, who was banned from campus when three women revealed incidences of sexual harassment that occurred since 2015. UW System became involved because of the peculiar circumstances including Hill, due to his honorary title as Associate of the Chancellor, which he was stripped of earlier this year. After the system revealed they found “merit” to the allegations, legislators called for Kopper’s resignation. Sen. Steve Nass, R-Whitewater, originally brought forward concerns of her management style, although they were tangential from the sexual harassment investigations. However, he noted his concern for whether female employees who were potentially harassed by Hill were “afraid” to come forward since they may have “feared retribution” from Kopper. Earlier this month, Board of Regents met in a closed meeting to discuss their concerns of Kopper and UW-La Crosse Chancellor Joe Gow, who was reprimanded after inviting a porn star to campus to discuss female empowerment and consent. At the meeting, the announced a system-wide 3 percent biannual salary increase for faculty and staff. Gow and Kopper were the two chancellors who were denied a raise. Kopper assumed her position in 2015 after serving as the university's provost since 2010.

Benitez posted more than 30 statements to his Instagram story, though he claimed to have spoken to at least 47 girls who had been harassed by the same person. Including those he did not speak to, Benitez estimated the student had harassed over 140 people.The accused student, a junior at MHS, was apparently fired from his job at Party City after being accused of sexual harassment, but Benitez said he has denied this to other students.Many of the accusations claim the student in question used Snapchat to harass them, though others said he harassed them in person at school.One girl alleged the student told her to “send me the sexiest picture you have of yourself” during an innocent game of Truth or Dare on Snapchat. At least a dozen girls said the accused student harassed them through Snapchat or text, including one claim that he “followed my friend to the mall through snap maps.” Snap maps is a feature on Snapchat where a user’s friend can see their current location.Multiple girls accused him of asking for nude photos or sending photos of his penis unprompted. Benitez posted the stories of six girls who had to either block the student on Snapchat or refuse to give him their username multiple times.Others told stories of in-person harassment or stalking. Several students claimed he had hit on them or their friends, as well as a teacher’s sister, despite being told multiple times to stop. “I confronted him about it and he just acted like it wasn’t a big deal,” one said.Many others reported being verbally harassed by the accused student. He allegedly commented on girl’s bodies frequently, often insulting them after being rejected.“[He] said I was worthless and dumb and that I had a nice ass. He said that’s the only reason people liked me. This was all in the first week of me being at MHS,” another said.Several girls accused him of following them to class and staring at them. Others said he touched them sexually without consent. Two girls accused him of touching them “on accident” or while pretending to trip. One said she had a friend who sat next to him in class, where “he would grab her thighs and her crotch.”Another said the student grabbed her and kissed her neck while she told him not to several times. “I can’t stand for this,” she said. “I will never forget the feeling of his hands touching my body. I will never forget his face. He has a special place in hell.”Benitez said the student has been reported to the school “definitely more than 20 times,” though only warnings have been issued.“The administration hears these cries for help from [his] victims but no longer takes them seriously,” Benitez said. “Friends of mine have reported him for harassment and asked to not have him in any of their classes. Eventually staff was unable to meet these requests because … they would eventually not be able to have anywhere to put him.”Benitez posted several replies from the accused student, who denied he had done anything wrong and claimed “like 90 percent” of the accusations were false. He also threatened to sue Benitez for libel.The students who protested also asked the administration to reinstate the Student Senate, which they said would help ensure the student body could bring such actions to the school’s attention and implement a no excuses policy for sexual harassment.Benitez said even though the actions of one student were immediately obvious, the protest was not against him directly but against the weak stance the administration has taken on sexual harassment.The students organizing the protest delivered printed copies of the allegations to the administration and encouraged anyone who had experienced sexual harassment at MHS to do the same.The school did not immediately return calls for comment.",‘He has a special place in hell:' Middleton High School students protest against sexual harassment,UWM

Temperatures are dropping, turkeys are gobbling in the distance and the smell of pumpkin pie lifts the spirits. Thanksgiving has become an iconic American holiday, ingrained into the modern way of life since the days of the hand-shaped paper turkey crafts made in kindergarten.As American schoolchildren, we are taught the history of Thanksgiving from our earliest days. From the moment Christopher Columbus stepped foot onto America to the feast enjoyed by both the Pilgrims and Native Americans, we have always been taught that Thanksgiving was a celebration of the harvest and to give thanks to all that the new world brought them. Even as our education continued into middle school or even high school, battles and uprisings between settlers and Native Americans were often brushed over; history classes still never painted the whole picture. I truly don’t remember an American history class where we learned about the harsh realities indigenous populations had to face.The real story of indigenous and settler relations is that of mass murder, ethnic cleansing, sexual abuse and harassment. Yet, these somehow seem to be missing from our textbooks. It is curious that we learn about the Holocaust and other gross injustices around the world, but not about the ones here at home.History in the United States' education system is softened, abridged, whitewashed. In a country where ""Catcher in the Rye"" and other literary novels are banned for their use of the f-word, it is not surprising that even history has been censored. We have been living in a system that chooses to keep inconvenient historical truth in the shadows, rather than to make students question or feel uncomfortable. Except, history is just that. It’s gruesome and uneasy and heavy; it cannot be forgotten or dismissed.This country is quite literally built on the backs of the Native Americans and slaves. Populations have been marginalized as a subclass of human existence, yet it’s not spoken of. People may know it, but they choose not to talk about it. History is repeatedly brushed under the rug.And so, during this Thanksgiving season, a time when history comes up naturally, it is vital that the good, as well as the bad, are recognized. Not only is this a time to give thanks for family and friends and the world, but also to give honor to those who suffered in the making of America. It must never escape us that the only reason we lead our lives in prosperity and joy is because of the eternal pain in others’.This has been a public service announcement.Kavitha Babu is a sophomore studying sociology and political science.

Educators fear such a narrow and binary definition would have the effect of rolling back important protections against discrimination on the basis of gender and gender identity.“These protections are important because transgender Americans in all parts of the country, including students and others on our campuses, have faced discrimination, isolation, and harassment,” the letter said. “Providing these protections is fully consistent with basic principles of fairness and respect for others.”",Blank joins other higher education leadership to oppose transgender memo,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/10/study-sheds-light-on-sextortion-fastest-growing-form-of-teen-cyberbullying,N/A,"One out of 20 teens report they have been sexually extorted online, according to new research out of UW-Eau Claire.Sexual extortion, or “sextortion,” occurs when a victim who voluntarily shares sexual images finds themself threatened with the release of those materials unless they meet the blackmailer’s demands — many of which are sexual. The U.S. Federal Justice department identified sextortion as the fastest growing form of online bullying among children and teens.Dr. Justin Patchin, the UW-Eau Claire researcher behind this study, surveyed of 5,500 middle and high school students nationwide and found that 5 percent of the teens he surveyed had experienced sextortion.""Five percent isn't a huge number but it's still a lot of young people and so it's something we can't ignore,” Patchin said. “Most often what we hear are the threats are made to post the images online or send the images to classmates or share them to other.”Males were more likely to initiate sextortion, but they were also more likely to be the victims of it, the study showed.“[That’s] surprising because most of the instances we hear about involve girls who share an image and then threats are made to disclose that image so it's happening more to boys even though we aren't hearing about it,” Patchin said.Victims of sextortion were harmed in a variety of ways, including being stalked or harassed (9.7 percent of males and 23.5 percent of females), being contacted repeatedly online or by phone (42.9 percent of males and 40.9 percent of females), or having a fake online profile created about them (11.2 percent of males and 8.7 percent of females), the study showed.Other findings revealed that adolescents who identified as non-heterosexual were more than twice as likely to be the victim of sextortion.Since this behavior mostly affects underage teens, Patchin believes that sextortion has gone widely underreported.""Young people are put in a difficult situation because technically speaking, if a 15 or 16 year old shares an explicit image with somebody else, they have broken a law and so that person that they shared the image with has a lot of power over them,” Patchin said. ""We need to provide opportunities for young people to come forward who make mistakes but still need help dealing with these situations.”","Study sheds light on sextortion, fastest-growing form of teen cyberbullying",UWM

Since then, there has been three incidents documented involving him.“As you can imagine, this is a challenging and unique set of circumstances for me as a wife, as a woman and as your Chancellor,” Kopper said in the statement. “As your Chancellor, I have worked diligently to ensure each of you has the supportive environment you need and deserve in which to do your amazing work.”After the investigation, UW System President Ray Cross sent the Board of Regents’ conclusions to Kopper, which found that the allegations were justified and Hill was expected to immediately leave his post at the university.The allegations included a “full-body” hug that lasted “too long,” and going in for a kiss on the mouth. It was reported he often called women “babe” and “sweetie.” Both incidents occurred in 2015, but Hill denied the accusations via his attorney. He claimed he “did not remember” the incidents but did not deny them from occurring.In April 2018, a female employee was sitting between Hill and the chancellor at an event. That employee told an investigator that he squeezed her knee under the table “no less than three times.” Hill said that it occurred one time instead of three because “he had to move her leg so he could reach his own to massage a cramp in his calf.”After the investigation concluded, Cross issued a statement announcing the chancellor executed the System’s recommendations.“I am confident the Chancellor will continue to make the well-being of the UW-Whitewater campus community a top priority,” Cross said in the statement. “In the UW System, it is one of our primary responsibilities to provide students, faculty and staff with a safe educational and work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment.”One of the women decided not to come forward at first for fear of retaliation and wanting to keep their “friendly working relationship” in tact. She also wanted to avoid embarrassing the chancellor by revealing the incident. The chancellor released the statement on her own accord with the UW System’s permission.“I remain deeply committed to serving you and continuing the work of our University to provide our students with an education that is truly transformational and to make a difference in our communities, the state, nation and the world,” Kopper said.",UW-Whitewater Chancellor’s husband barred from campus following sexual harassment investigation,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/09/why-brett-kavanaugh-cannot-be-appointed,"September 13, 2018 | 9:00am CDT","Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing opening statement consisted of fun-filled memories and heartfelt thank-you’s. He expressed how much he loves his family, adding light-hearted anecdotes about his wife and kids. He was trying to relate to you. Maybe he succeeded.But his barbecue dad persona and love of coaching his kid’s basketball team hold no relation to serving on the Supreme Court of the United States. Unfortunately, as affable as Kavanaugh appears, as much as you may want to like him, his hearings and past rulings validate fears regarding the future of women’s rights, environmental protection presidential power.A possible Kavanaugh confirmation foreshadows an eerie series of hyper-conservative policies that could last for decades he’s trying to cover it all up with unwarranted chuckles and by sidestepping questions.Roe v. Wade is in danger.Kavanaugh spent a good amount of his opening statement talking about how proud he is to have “strong” daughters, but his track record and comments indicate that he would have no problem taking away their right to choose.During his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh continuously dodged questions regarding potential future rulings on abortion, saying that Roe v. Wade has been upheld by “precedent,” seemingly attempting to sound indifferent about the case.However, Kavanaugh’s past rulings contradict his apparent nonchalance regarding a woman’s right to choose.Garza v. Hargan determined that an undocumented immigrant minor could be temporarily released from custody in order to obtain an abortion.Kavanaugh wrote a decision blocking the abortion for 10 days, which was later overturned by an appeals court. Kavanaugh then drafted a dissent accusing the majority of discounting the “precedent” of valuing fetal life and thinking that “the Government must allow unlawful immigrant minors to have an immediate abortion on demand.”Despite Kavanaugh’s apparent rigidity towards “precedent,” he fails to exercise the same interpretation when he politically disagrees with previous rulings. In 1979, Bellotti v. Baird ruled that a minor may choose to terminate their pregnancy without parental consent.In addition, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey asserts that the government may not place unjustifiable obstacles in the way of a woman’s ability to exercise her right to abortion pre-viability.A 2003 email further demonstrates Kavanaugh’s flexibility toward abortion precedent.Kavanaugh writes “I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since the Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so,” contradicting his aim to appear to be impartial during his confirmation hearing, where he called the case “settled law.”He later claimed that the email did not entail his personal views on abortion and was merely attempting to view the case from a scholarly standpoint.Regardless of this excuse, it is abundantly clear that Kavanaugh discounts only set precedents he personally disagrees with, a habit he has hypocritically claimed judges should avoid.The effects of climate change are only worsening, and Kavanaugh doesn’t plan on helping.His past rulings show that he favors deregulation and stripping the Environmental Protection Agency of the power to protect the environment.In a 2014 opinion regarding White Stallion Energy Center LLC v. EPA, Kavanaugh argued that the EPA should take into consideration the financial effects of imposing regulations on fossil fuels. The court sided with the EPA, affirming that the agency did not need to take monetary costs into account. It seems Kavanaugh is unaware that it’s not the EPA’s job to save oil and coal companies money.Furthermore, in 2016, Kavanaugh argued that Congress should take on the issue of climate change in place of the EPA, supposedly not trusting environmental experts to handle it.He stated that since climate change was not known at the time of the EPA’s establishment, they have no legal authority to address it. This interpretation is problematic for a variety of reasons.First, Kavanaugh’s timeline is simply incorrect. The first research on climate change was published in 1965, and the EPA was established in 1970. The second problem with Kavanaugh’s view is that the Clean Air Act does not provide a specific list of pollutants the EPA is allowed to regulate, but rather enables the EPA to regulate “any air pollutant” that “endangers public health and welfare.”Trump appointing Kavanaugh raises major concerns regarding presidential power.Kavanaugh has implied that he does not think a sitting President of the United States should be subject to investigation, noting in a 2009 article that he believes “the President should be excused from some of the burdens of ordinary citizenship.”In the same article, he goes on to insinuate that the Osama bin Laden assassination could have happened earlier if Clinton hadn’t been “distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.”Furthermore, during his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh couldn’t give Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D - California) a straight answer when she asked if he thought a president could pardon himself from an investigation, claiming that it was a “hypothetical” question about “something [he’s] never analyzed.”Kavanaugh has yet to commit to or even hint at recusing himself from a potential case brought about by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that has already resulted in indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers and multiple Trump aides.If Trump were to be indicted for obstruction of justice, his own pick for the Supreme Court would oversee the case, raising questions of impartiality.Overall, Kavanaugh and his hyper-partisan tendencies would be a disaster in the Supreme Court.A Supreme Court justice with a lengthy history of serving the Republican party and consistently demonstrating conservative ideology has no chance of being a “neutral and impartial arbitrator” as he has claimed.He selectively applies precedent to cases, especially those concerning a woman’s right to choose, and he has little regard for the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency. Most alarmingly, his beliefs regarding presidential investigations have the potential to lead us into a constitutional crisis.Ashley is a sophomore studying journalism.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/02/forum-discusses-inclusivity-for-transgender-students-on-campuses,"February 22, 2018 | 8:29pm CST","UW-Madison faculty and students met at the Education Building Thursday to discuss ways to promote transgender inclusivity on college campuses.Z Nicolazzo, an assistant professor of higher education and student affairs at Northern Illinois University, spoke to approximately 50 students and faculty about the importance of fostering an inclusive campus environment, saying there are ongoing obstacles that transgender individuals face on campuses across the country.Nicolazzo stressed the importance of education in the inclusion process. She said one of the first steps to fostering gender inclusivity is having cisgender people intentionally reach out to queer studies people, to the LGBT Campus Center and to various other queer spaces.“Everyone has a stake in gender liberation,” she said.UW-Madison’s first-ever campus climate survey found disparities in how transgender students experience campus. Data show that 51 percent of transgender students have experienced hostile, harassing or intimidating behavior on campus, and 25 percent have seriously considered leaving the university.Additionally, a quarter of UW-Madison’s transgender population feel excluded on campus. Just nine percent of white students reported feeling similarly.According to Nicolazzo’s research, transgender identities are being erased and replaced with stereotypical definitions of sexuality, which is contributing to the oppression of transgender individuals on college campuses.Gender binary discourse regulates what is “appropriate” gender and permeates all facets of campus, including classrooms, she said.“It’s not always things that are said,” Nicolazzo said. “It’s a hidden curriculum of policies, practices, attitudes and behaviors.”Chris A. Barcelos, an assistant professor of gender and women’s studies at UW-Madison, said there are ways to combat gender binary discourse in the classroom. This can be done, Barcelos said, by including transgender authors in class curriculum or by integrating non-binary topics throughout the semester rather than in just one lesson plan.Nicolazzo agreed, adding that change needs to be made not only in the classroom, but across campus because resources are highly maldistributed.“We need to invest in change beyond bathrooms and pronouns,” she said.Barcelos addressed UW-Madison’s divide in perceptions of inclusivity, acknowledging that while many students feel this way, university resources like the LGBT Campus Center can help transgender students by giving them a support system.“You may feel like you are not welcome, but you are,” Barcelos said.",Forum discusses inclusivity for transgender students on campuses,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/01/uw-madison-employees-one-step-away-from-pay-increase-after-years-of-retention-woes,"January 22, 2018 | 7:28pm CST","UW-Madison employees could get an across-the-board four percent pay increase, including those making less than $15 an hour.If approved, 70 percent of the cost will be covered by the state budget while the remaining amount would come from the hike in tuition for out-of-state students, the Wisconsin State Journal reported.UW-Madison professor Chad Goldberg, president of United Faculty and Academic Staff, said the measure is “overdue and very welcome,” particularly for those earning less than $15 an hour.According to university spokesperson Greg Bump, faculty and staff would be eligible unless any of the following apply:

1. Employees who have documented unsatisfactory performance2. Employees hired after Jan. 8, 2018 (Would not receive either phase of the plan)3. Those in temporary positions with a rate established for the duration (Ex: interim director)
4. Employees who haven’t finished required sexual harassment prevention training5. Supervisors who not current on their employee performance evaluations

Last summer, the state’s Joint Finance Committee approved the four percent pay increase for all state employees. That vote came after UW-Madison struggled to retain faculty due to a loss of tenure rights from state statute and a $250 million cut to the UW System in the last budget. UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank acknowledged these issues in her statement on the JFC vote.“Providing this increase will help us attract and retain the best and brightest instructors, researchers and staff,” Blank said.

An annual retention report from fall 2016 showed that more faculty were being recruited than in 2015, a rise of about 40 percent. Bump said that compared to other Big Ten schools, the university still trails behind in salaries for faculty, but the increase would close the gap.

The next step for the pay increase to take effect is for the Joint Committee on Employment Relations to give its approval. While Goldberg said he hopes that this will happen, he added that the raises shouldn’t come at the cost of employee benefit changes like increased health insurance premiums, co-pays and deductibles.

“These raises don’t make up for the legislature’s elimination of collective bargaining rights and the weakening of tenure and shared governance,” Goldberg said. “The most effective way to foster loyalty to the University of Wisconsin is to give employees a voice in their workplace and a share in the institution’s power.”",UW-Madison employees one step away from pay increase after years of retention woes,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/09/former-uw-whitewater-chancellor-granted-paid-leave-for-unknown-reasons,"September 5, 2019 | 9:10pm CDT","Former UW-Whitewater Chancellor Beverly Kopper is on paid leave instead of teaching psychology courses this semester as planned, The Gazette Xtra reported Wednesday.Kopper’s Dec. 31 resignation from the chancellor position occurred months after her husband, Alan “Pete” Hill, was barred from campus following sexual harassment allegations. As part of her exit agreement, Kopper was granted a position as a tenured professor starting this fall, making 75% more than the average psychology faculty member.However, Kopper’s four classes for the fall 2019 semester have now been reassigned to other UW-Whitewater faculty.Officials haven’t clarified the nature of Kopper’s leave. UW-Whitewater spokesperson Jeff Angileri and UW System spokesperson Mark Pitsch only said that the leave was “granted” and it was a personal matter, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. New Chancellor Dwight Watson spoke of Kopper working on campus again as recently as Aug. 19 in an interview with The Gazette, where he expressed support.“When it comes to the chancellor working here at the institution, she has tenure within the psychology department,” Watson said. “It’s a part of her contracted right to teach within her tenured department. And I’m glad she’s on board.”In January, Kopper submitted a work proposal to UW System President Ray Cross stating that until the fall semester began she would be developing class syllabi and assignments, as well as getting up-to-date on necessary teaching technologies since she hasn’t taught in a classroom in over 10 years, the State Journal reported. However, UW-Whitewater didn’t list Kopper as a professor for any courses during class registration for fall 2019 in the spring, according to the State Journal. At the time, Angileri told the State Journal that it wasn’t out of the ordinary for instructor names to be added as students continue to enroll.State Senator Steve Nass, R-Whitewater, described Kopper’s paid leave a “taxpayer-funded scam” in the days after she announced her resignation. Nass’ chief of staff, Mike Mikalsen, told the State Journal Wednesday that this latest development was proof Nass was right about the situation being a “non-settlement settlement.” “Taxpayers and students paying tuition are left paying for someone to do nothing for a potentially long period of time,” Mikalsen said.A UW System investigation found no evidence that Kopper knew of her husband’s behavior. However, she also did not question him before the allegations became public, leading the investigators to call Hill’s behavior a “blind spot” for Kopper.Kopper called the investigation’s results “rampant with speculation” and “no more than a preconceived conclusion in search of supporting evidence” in a response a few days later.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/09/not-the-beginning-of-a-campaign-but-the-continuation-taa-fights-for-higher-pay-fee-relief,"September 4, 2019 | 9:36pm CDT","The first day of the 2019-’20 academic year was far from the first day of activism for the Teaching Assistants’ Association. Around 100 graduate students and other supporters of TAA protested this morning on Bascom Hill against low pay, segregated fees, the international student fee and a lack of workplace policies — all of which TAA have been campaigning for years. “Graduate workers basically keep the university running. We teach, we do research, but at the same time, we're not getting paid a good amount for our work,” TAA publicity committee member Anna Meier said. “We just want to remind the administration after all of the work that we did last year that we're still here, we're still fighting on the first day of the semester.”As protesters gathered at the base of the hill, some TAA members passed out flyers to students who passed by. These flyers read “The University Works Because We Do — Stand With Us!” and outlined TAA’s three demands: a raise in wages, fee relief for both graduate workers and international students and university-wide workplace policies.The flyer states that some TAs’ annual wages only amount to $13,200, occasionally requiring them to take on a third or fourth job to support themselves.However, the majority of graduate students are paid at least $20,000 per year and receive tuition remission — where the university waives the cost of tuition — valued at $15,000 per year, News and Media Relations Director Meredith McGlone said. Graduate workers are required to pay segregated fees — the money that covers services such as bus passes, recreational facilities and University Health Services — which will add up to $1,451.96 over the course of this academic year, according to the Bursar’s Office.International graduate students also must pay an additional $100 fee, which Meier said is “incredibly discriminatory.”However, UW-Madison did raise the minimum TA stipend 9% for fiscal year 2020, which McGlone said will balance out the fees. “Minimum TA stipends at UW-Madison have risen 41.9% over an eight-year period, a percentage well above other employment groups. These increases more than offset the amount graduate students pay in segregated fees,” McGlone said in an emailed statement. “We maintain that it’s fair for all students to pay segregated fees to support high-quality student services.”The TAA’s last demand is for university-level policies covering workplace conditions for graduate workers, including research assistants and graduate student lecturers. These policies would cover issues such as sexual harassment and working additional hours, as well as allow graduate workers to participate in reviewing their effectiveness, according to TAA member Taylor Tai.Tai said one goal moving forward is to raise awareness of these issues among undergraduate students, which the flyers will hopefully help with. She said it’s important for them to understand that TAA isn’t just “mad,” especially considering the good relationships graduate students have with teachers and undergraduates. In general, undergraduates aren’t very knowledgeable about the concerns of graduate students, Meier said. However, this isn’t their fault. “The university does a very good job of not publicizing the conditions of graduate workers,” Meier said. “But we encourage undergrads to ask their TAs about what's going on and for TAs also to talk about workplace conditions because we probably have a lot of shared interests in this area — from everything from gender-neutral bathrooms all the way down to being generally underpaid, as a lot of undergrads are trying to work local jobs while going to college.”Eventually, the protesters marched up Bascom Hill while chanting sayings like “Fees are wage theft!” and “Get up! Get down! Madison’s a union town!” Graduate students kept chanting as around 60 of them entered Bascom Hall. After knocking on the office doors of Chancellor Rebecca Blank, Graduate School Dean William Karpus, Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration Laurent Heller and Provost John Karl Scholz, a TAA member slid a copies of the organization’s petition — with thousands of signatures from the university and local community — under their doors. None of the four university administrators opened their doors for the graduate workers.At the end of the protest, one TAA member reminded the crowd of the goals of the event, declaring it “not the beginning of a campaign, but the continuation.” Update 9/5/19 2:15 p.m.: This article has been updated to include additional information on graduate student stipends.","‘Not the beginning of a campaign, but the continuation’: TAA fights for higher pay, fee relief",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/05/race-memes-marijuana-the-controversial-shutdown-of-lion-of-judah-house-of-rastafari-church,"May 29, 2019 | 3:42pm CDT","A police raid shut down a church distributing sacraments of marijuana Wednesday — but illegal distribution of the drug was only part of the controversy. The backlash escalated when Madison residents discovered the two founders of the Rastafari church — an Africa-centered religion originating in Jamaica — are white men who post offensive content on the church’s Facebook page. The church, called Lion of Judah, House of Rastafari, was located on Mifflin Street and run by Jesse Schworck and Dylan Bangert. They offered marijuana to members of the church in exchange for monetary donations — and becoming a member only took signing a membership card. Schworck and Bangert faced their first public challenges when Madison police confiscated “several jars of marijuana and drug paraphernalia” on March 26. Two weeks later, the city attorney’s office sent them a “cease and desist drug nuisance” letter stating the Lion of Judah church was violating the law. The Dane County Narcotics Task Force and Madison police raided and shut down the church shortly before 9 a.m. Wednesday morning, where both Schworck and Bangert were arrested. From the Lion of Judah’s March opening to Wednesday’s shutdown, the church had enough time to cause controversy in the Madison community about more than just marijuana. An offensive online presenceLion of Judah often posted on Facebook to encourage more people to come to their church, attracting nearly 2,200 online followers.However, some posts displayed views that are harmful to the LGBTQ+ community, women and black individuals.  The church shared a since-deleted post — an edited picture in the style of a meme — depicting wildlife enthusiast Steve Irwin holding up a black woman with the text, “Here we have a wild hoodrat … Once a hoodrat reaches sexual maturity, she will begin a mating dance known as ‘twerking’ to find a mate to supply her with food and shelter.”Madison resident Nicole Banks said discovering this post was “quite shocking.” She reacted by messaging Lion of Judah’s Facebook page, asking about the religious significance of the meme. “I dont know wat response u wish for about meme..we not apologizing..it is our culture to not be whorish..weather man or woman..black or white..” the church responded over Facebook messenger, typing in what Banks referred to as a fake Jamaican accent. “So. We burn black whores and white whores with no apology.”Facebook was the one to take down the post, not the church, Schworck told The Daily Cardinal. Furthermore, Schworck stood by the meme. “We don't support twerking and sexual promiscuousness and hyper-sexualization, whether it's a black or white or anybody doing it. Because of my appearance, I'm not going to hold my tongue for anybody,” he said. “If black people don't like that, that's something from their culture that has been a negative impact, then they need to clean up their house.”Demetrius Walker, a Madisonian and member of the Rastafari religion for a year and a half, was initially excited by the presence of a Rastafari church in Madison, but after seeing its social media, he grew apprehensive. He had a different opinion about what Rastafaris should say about the post depicting black women. “That's not anything that Rastafaris are supposed to be posting or even discussing like that, and it's hard for me — you never disrespect black women like that,” Walker said. “We're not going to say peace and love and then treat our women badly. That's not peace and love at all.”Other posts that have stirred up controversy include a picture illustrating a woman in an apron taking a pan out of the oven with the text, “Feminism is the idea that women are free when they serve their employers but slaves when they serve their husband and children.” Another post depicted an outline of a man and woman holding hands, reading “straight pride.” Schworck defended this post, too, citing examples of how straight couples “keep the earth populated” and “make opposites attract.” He said he’s proud of his heterosexuality, and the post served to fight against “heterophobia.”“It's real for us people that are heterosexual people that are fine with our lifestyle, but we feel constant harassment from certain elements in [the LGBTQ+] community that are trying to force their ideology for us to accept,” Schworck said. “We can live and let live, we can agree to disagree, we don't beat people up and call them names and stuff. We just promote our lifestyle, and they want to promote theirs.”Schworck’s claims of “heterophobia” have inflamed commenters on the original post because it minimizes the harassment members of the LGBTQ+ community have to face on a daily basis. Fifty-seven percent of LGBTQ+ people say that they or an LGBTQ+ friend or family member have been threatened or non-sexually harassed, 51 percent have been sexually harassed and 51 percent have experienced violence because of their sexuality or gender identity, according to a 2017 Harvard study. After her conversation with Lion of Judah over Facebook, Banks felt she had to get the word out about the church’s conduct. “I really felt like as a citizen, people should be aware of who they're supporting,” she said. “I think that most in the community are in support of legalization of marijuana, and that's why they back these people.”Community backlash against Lion of Judah took the form of a protest May 22. Around 20 people participated, rallying against the social media posts expressing racist, homophobic and sexist views, according to Fox 47. Schworck didn’t seem bothered by protest, according to the church’s Facebook page. He shared the Fox 47 story, writing “More news coverage!!!” while also calling the protesters a “band of baboons … bless their hearts.”Accusations of cultural appropriationDana Pellebon, a Madison resident and one of the protesters, has her own history with Lion of Judah. After seeing the church “spewing bullshit” on a friend’s social media page, she reached out to Lion of Judah to express her concerns. According to Pellebon, she didn’t receive answers, so she decided to go down to the church, in person. “As far as I was concerned, I was going down there to have a conversation because they are online, saying very clearly what it is that they're doing and why it is that they're doing it,” Pellebon said. “So to me, they should be able to answer very simple questions about what it is that they're doing and why.”Pellebon, recording the encounter and later posting a video to Facebook, was forced out of the store after telling Schworck and Bangert she wanted to talk to them about cultural appropriation. Schworck called Pellebon a “neanderthal,” and she said another man put his hands on her while escorting her from the building. Schworck said people are shown respect at his church if they show the people of the church respect when they arrive. He accused Pellebon of “race-baiting” and said that’s not what Rastafari is about. Banks agreed with Pellebon’s assessment of cultural appropriation in Lion of Judah’s adaptation of the Rastafari religion. She also suggested Schworck and Bangert have an ulterior motive for opening the church. “I know that [Schworck] has a video saying something about the freedom to practice your religion. Most of the people who are going there are not practicing that religion,” Banks said. “They're just there to buy weed, and these guys are there. They're using this church as a front to sell weed, to set themselves up as a dispensary. Once it does become legal in Wisconsin, they'd already be set up.”However, Schworck considers himself to be very dedicated to Rastafari. He’s traveled to Jamaica and Kenya a dozen times each to gain firsthand knowledge and make connections, he said. “Rastafari is for all people ... It's not about excluding certain groups of people or trying to marginalize them,” Schworck said. “This thing is not just some black supremacy thing. This isn't for all black people, it's for everybody. The people that are upset about it are black people with white hearts.”Cultural appropriation wasn’t one of Walker’s main concerns with Lion of Judah. He brought up his own background to say that anyone can discover the Rastafari religion, regardless of where they’re from.“Rastafari is any color,” Walker said. “As far as two white guys being Rastafaris, I mean, you can be from anywhere because I'm from Illinois, and I'm just getting into it later in life because I found Rastafari.” Schworck said it comes down to the fact that “certain cultures have better things than other cultures.” “What's wrong with other people trying to assimilate themselves onto something good? It's not about ‘That's a black thing,' or anything,” he said. “This is something that God gave earth.”However, Banks still thinks Lion of Judah goes too far with their adaptation of Rastafarian culture.“It is possible to adopt another culture's practices and beliefs without going all the way with the dreadlocks, wearing the Rasta colors, speaking and typing in a Jamaican accent,” she said. “It always strikes a nerve when you see people who are white taking over another culture without a lot of thought to it.”No arrests made for monthsAfter receiving the cease and desist letter from the city, not much appeared to change for Lion of Judah until the morning of the raid. Marijuana was still given to church members and some smoked on site. For Pellebon, the lack of immediate action against Schworck and Bangert was all about race. If they weren’t white, there wouldn’t have been a “strongly worded letter,” she said.  “There are racial discrepancies that are happening. And this is a huge example of it,” Pellebon said. “The kids who are supporting this and the people that are supporting this are supporting mass incarceration of black men. Because when you support a white man getting away with something, that just means that another black man's going down.”Banks expressed similar sentiments prior to Wednesday’s raid, saying that “no one can deny” that “if they were men of color, they would be in jail by now.”African Americans are disproportionately arrested for drug offenses in the United States — as The Sentencing Project reported more than one in four individuals arrested for drug law violations in 2015 was black, despite drug use rates being similar across different racial groups. Pellebon wanted to see the city do more to stop Lion of Judah. “This is ridiculous, and the Madison police know it's ridiculous, and the city attorney knows it's ridiculous,” she said. City Attorney Michael May said in a voicemail he couldn’t comment on the Lion of Judah case because it is an ongoing investigation. The future of Rastafari in MadisonWalker was torn between wanting a Rastafari church in the community and not wanting to support Lion of Judah’s values, so he chose the third option — start his own church. “It's a going to be a learning and cultural center where people can come in and learn about Rastafari [and] learn about other African spirituality, where you can learn about some of our black heroes,” Walker said.Walker’s church, Lost Tribe of Judah, has a Facebook page and a GoFundMe to raise money and find the church a permanent location. Walker said he’s still discussing if his church will use marijuana as a sacrament. However, he was very clear that the Lost Tribe of Judah will not distribute the substance like the Lion of Judah did. “When we sit down and use it as a sacrament, it's part of Rastafari, part of our religion,” Walker said. “As far as just you can come in and get the membership card ... we won't do that. We won't operate that way.”Walker also wants his Rastafari church to “build the community up,” a piece he said was missing from Schworck and Bangert’s location. Families will be welcome, and Walker plans to use his church to help people going through hard times find jobs, saying that’s what true Rastafaris do.However, Walker does credit Lion of Judah with laying the groundwork for creating a Rastafari church in Madison. Ultimately, he said he wants Lion of Judah to use the public scrutiny as a learning experience. “I hope they learn from this,” Walker said. “They might go back and try to correct their mistakes.”Banks and Pellebon were less optimistic, both expressing their desire for the city to shut down Lion of Judah, which has since become a reality.Still, Walker hopes the controversy surrounding the church doesn’t cloud the community’s judgement of the Rastafari religion as a whole. “It's not just about taking a donation and getting weed out. Rastafari is a spirituality, it's a lifestyle,” he said. “It is about peace, love and togetherness.”","Race, memes, marijuana: The controversial shutdown of Lion of Judah, House of Rastafari church",UWM

While investigators found no direct evidence that Kopper knew about her husband, Alan “Pete” Hill’s consistent harassment of students and employees on campus, they wrote that “at best” it was a “blind spot” for her. The 18-page report released Friday found no incriminating evidence against Kopper, including no negative interactions with women who made the allegations against her husband since 2017.The report is “no more than a preconceived conclusion in search of supporting evidence” that depends on anonymous and secondhand sources, Kopper’s letter said. She also noted the consistent use of “may be,” “might be” and “could be” to support conclusions drawn. Kopper sent a one-sentence resignation to UW System President Ray Cross on Dec. 31 following backlash from the local community, as well as the Board of Regents, indicating they were in search for new leadership.The UW System released documents to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Sept. 14 after they filed an open records request. Those documents revealed Cross had banned Hill in June after the investigation found substantial evidence supporting the sexual harassment claims.Investigators found that it was “noteworthy” Kopper did not notify UW-Whitewater about her husband’s case until September. However, she stated in the letter she sent out a statement “when she had permission from UW System to do so.”She revealed that she remained on the outskirts of the investigation since talking with her husband more would have appeared suspicious. She also said she consulted the System’s general counsel throughout the process. While the report mistook Kopper’s words on believing each allegation against her husband came out of a grudge held against her, she “does not believe this and has never so stated.”Yet, the report includes statements from witnesses who found that Kopper created a “hostile work environment” while in leadership in addition to how she handled the allegations. They also said she micromanaged, was unclear on budgets and would yell at employees until she was “red in the face.” Kopper had no chance to combat these remarks during her interview but criticized them in documents shared by her lawyer. By not being able to discuss those claims, Kopper was unable to tell investigators that Cross said she was “excellent with managing the budget,” in a 2018 letter. She will return to UW-Whitewater in the fall with a position among the psychology faculty, earning a salary of $118,308 — over 50 percent more than the department chair.

The investigation revealed her husband, Alan “Pete” Hill’s, behavior toward women to be “pervasive and well-known,” leading university employees to take “steps to protect one another” from him, the report read. However, there was no official evidence Kopper knew of Hill’s behavior, but she also did not question Hill before the harassment allegations became public. ""At best, this suggests that Hill's behavior was a blind spot for the Chancellor,"" investigators said.When speaking with investigators, Kopper said she was “very upset” upon learning of the allegations, but withdrew from discussion due to her position and Hill’s communication with a lawyer. ""I married him for his heart,"" she said. ""There are so many things that I know ... it doesn't compute.""Hill was banned from campus after a previous investigation concluded he sexually harassed female employees at UW-Whitewater. UW System President Ray Cross restricted Hill from attending campus events and stripped him of his honorary position as Associate of the Chancellor in a letter dated June 2018. The most recent investigation that completed on Jan. 1 looked into the response to sexual harassment allegations against Hill, and the UW System released the results Friday. The women who came forward said Hill touched them in an “unprofessional” and “unwanted” way, and that he made statements “laden with sexual innuendo.” The investigators found “credible evidence” that Hill sexually harassed students and employees, adding that the harassment occurred on campus or during campus-related events — some of which took place in the chancellor’s residence. They also revealed Kopper took 84 days to tell her cabinet and nearly three weeks to respond to a letter from Cross about Hill’s from campus. The interview also disclosed that she did not know if Hill had completed sexual harassment awareness training that was recommended from a 2017 investigation into harassment claims or as an expected requirement in 2018. She also ""took no steps to inform herself about the allegation, other than to be satisfied with Hill's denial of the allegations"" and believed each allegation to be due to resentment against her and Hill. Lastly, she did not discuss the claims with her husband because of his own representation and that she was “wearing the Chancellor’s hat.”Kopper feels the repercussionsAs public pressure calling for Kopper’s resignation mounted, she ended her time as UW-Whitewater’s chancellor with a campus-wide email announcing her departure, effective Dec. 31, 2018.

As of next fall, Kopper will be paid a salary of $118,308. This is around 38 percent more than the largest current salary in the department. Until she starts her new position as a psychology professor, Kopper will be on paid leave with a stipend of $242,760 until the end of August.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/03/karl-lagerfelds-controversial-legacy,"March 17, 2019 | 8:35pm CDT","On Tuesday, February 19, various social media platforms were flooded with supermodels, celebrities and mundane users paying tribute to one of haute couture’s most iconic designers, Karl Lagerfeld. The prolific designer created his own namesake brand all while hoisting Chanel out of its lowest point and revolutionizing Fendi for a consecutive 51 years. Although he was considered one of the kings of fashion, I would describe him as more of a tyrant.There’s no denying that Lagerfeld was a creative genius, nevertheless, his transformative effects on the fashion world do not excuse his misogyny, racism, and fatphobia. His death was glorified all over America, but at what point will people draw the line and realize fame does not excuse oppression and abuse?Lagerfeld needs to be recognized for his despotism. The characteristics that the fashion world has been attacked and chastised for, are the values Karl Lagerfeld upheld.Actress and model Jameela Jamil got criticized for calling out Lagerfeld on his controversial beliefs the day after his death. Granted, he had just died, so while the timing wasn’t ideal, his attitudes and comments cannot be ignored or pardoned otherwise it is used to set an example for people in powerful positions that offensive and hurtful behavior will be tolerated. Lagerfeld was constantly in the public eye and was very aware of his influence and power in the fashion industry, yet he repeatedly made horribly offensive comments. Aside from the time he brushed a comment off as a joke and later apologized for it, Lagerfeld made very little effort to conceal his abhorrent beliefs. He openly voiced his annoyance with the #metoo movement, a movement that has raised incredible awareness about the prevalence of sexual abuse and harassment. Lagerfeld was also criticized for defending  Karl Templer, a widely known fashion stylist who, without consent, allegedly pulled model’s underwear off. Lagerfeld later commented on the issue and disclosed that “If you don’t want your pants pulled about, don’t become a model! Join a nunnery, there’ll always be a place for you in the convent.” It didn’t take much time for the public to retaliate and chastise Lagerfeld for his disdainful remark.  Lagerfeld needs to be recognized and talked about for the entirety of his character, and not just the lush, exciting parts. Racism and sexism are very relevant institutional issues today. By glorifying a man who spread these ideals, society is accepting these social injustices. Those who say nothing are contributing to the problem. President Donald Trump has been criticized repeatedly for his many similar, gruesome comments, yet he is considered one of the best businessmen in the world.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/03/retirement-resignation-of-uw-system-chancellors-will-test-new-hiring-policies,"March 7, 2019 | 9:00am CST","Following the resignation and retirement of two UW System chancellors in the past four months, the Board of Regents will soon have two chancellor searches underway. For the first time, they will test out the controversial hiring process changes first put in place between 2015 and 2017. UW-Stout Chancellor Bob Meyer announced Monday he will be retiring in August. This makes him the second chancellor the UW System will need to find a replacement for after former UW-Whitewater Chancellor Beverly Kopper resigned following allegations of sexual harassment against her husband. The last time the System selected a new chancellor was Kopper in July of 2015, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. At the time of her appointment, the UW System had just created new rules for Search and Screen Committees a month earlier, UW-Milwaukee associate professor Nicholas Fleisher said on Twitter. The 2017 policy change for hiring UW System leadership most notably expanded the candidate pool to allow applicants from the private sector, making it possible for a hiring committee to select an individual without experience working in education, according to a UW System press release. Before the new policy was enacted, there were no regulations on whether a UW System chancellor needed an academic background. At UW-Madison, candidates had to be tenurable, which meant they needed a PhD, according to Tom Broman, a member of the Steering Committee for PROFS, a UW-Madison faculty advocacy organization. By creating this new hiring policy, the Board of Regents was attempting to develop a System-wide rule affecting UW-Madison, Broman said.“In essence, by introducing this policy, the Regents were trying to force Madison to change the way it did stuff,” he said.The idea that someone with no educational experience could become chancellor gave some faculty members and organizations pause, including PROFS — which opposed the new policy — according to Broman. “It doesn’t make sense to have somebody who has never worked in higher ed come in to try to run the organization, just as a major company wouldn’t bring in a professor to come in and run the company,” Jack O’Meara, a lobbyist for PROFS, said at the time of the policy change. “They would want somebody who understands how that company works and can effectively lead the organization.”Broman, on the other hand, said an applicant’s background isn’t quite as telling. “Not having a PhD is neither a guarantee of success or a guarantee of failure,” he said. “The more important criterion is whether the person coming in understands what universities are, and by that measure, a person with a PhD is more likely to know something about that.”The UW System chose to make this change in order to “streamline” the hiring process of university leadership and produce more fruitful results, according to the press release. “The average amount of time to hire a new chancellor from the announcement of their resignation or retirement to naming a replacement is about nine months,” Regent Vice President Drew Petersen said in the release. “That is simply too long as we want our campuses to continue to run smoothly during this type of transition.”Along with the change to candidate requirements, 2017 brought a change to the Search and Screen Committee. Before fall 2015, the Board of Regents mandated the Search and Screen Committee to have a faculty majority from the institution in question, the policy said. Two years later, the Regents reduced the number of committee members to 10 — five Regents, two faculty members, one staff representative from the university, one student, and one community and/or alumni member, according to the current Board of Regents policy.“The changes are problematic because they take the search and screen process out of the hands of the people who are on campus and in the community, and who know the needs of the institution: faculty, staff, students, and community members,” Fleisher said in an email. Broman echoed Fleisher’s sentiments. He said the local parties present in the hiring process are a very mixed group, and the policy change diminished their voices. However, Broman said the situation wasn’t as dire as others made it sound. “You don't need a PhD to be a good leader of a university,” he said. “A good leader of any organization is someone who has an idea and can get other people to go along with it, that's what successful leadership is.”","Retirement, resignation of UW System chancellors will test new hiring policies",UWM

As a portion of her exit agreement — as is the general procedure for university leaders — she was set to start a position as a tenured psychology professor.  However, receiving a salary nearly 50 percent more than the UW-Whitewater psychology department chairwoman, is not the norm. As of next fall, Kopper will be paid a salary of $118,308. This is more than 75 percent the average psychology faculty member earns and 38 percent more than the largest current salary in the department. Until she starts her new position, Kopper will be be on paid leave with a stipend of $242,760 until the end of August. This, along with her nine-month salary, was revealed Dec. 17., the same day Kopper announced her resignation.  UW System Spokesperson Mark Pitsch told GazetteXtra that “Kopper’s new salary is less than the one she earned as UW-Whitewater’s provost.” She will be teaching four classes — three in the classroom and one online course — each semester in the 2019-20 academic year. She is now contracted as a tenured psychology professor at the university. The UW System required Kopper to develop a proposal documenting a work outline for the upcoming semester by Jan. 31. In her letter, she wrote that she has “not been in the classroom or lab in over a decade.” Kopper has never taught at UW-Whitewater. Before the fall semester begins, Kopper must develop a class syllabus, read texts, prepare assignments and learn new classroom technologies. Her resignation came after allegations that she created a “hostile work environment.” The university was also amid investigations that her husband, Pete “Alan” Hill, sexually harassed female employees at UW-Whitewater, where he had an honorary position. After the system revealed they found “merit” to the allegations, legislators called for Kopper’s resignation. When her one-sentence resignation was announced, frequent critiquer State Sen. Steve Nass, R-Whitewater, voiced his opinions against the exit agreement. He originally brought forward concerns of her management style, although they were tangential from the sexual harassment investigations. However, he noted his concern for whether female employees who were potentially harassed by Hill were “afraid” to come forward since they may have “feared retribution” from Kopper.The UW System opened a second investigation in September after more women spoke about their experiences. That investigation closed in December, however those records have yet to released to media outlets.

In addition to the suspension, Gonzalez was also required to view a sexual harassment training video and write an apology letter to the coworker he harassed. The Wisconsin State Journal also reported he was disciplined later that year for missing or showing up late for shifts without notifying a superior. In response to the State Journal’s report, Gonzalez issued a statement denying he made the phone call but admitted he had done nothing to stop them. Gonzales is no stranger to controversy, having been the target of a lawsuit last year claiming he had engaged in malpractice while a practicing attorney. Isthmus reported Gonzalez barely did any work in constructing a coherent defense for his client in a criminal case, leading to a conviction that was later overturned. In 2017, he allegedly offered to send Isthmus a picture of a client’s penis, as the picture was a focal point in the trial. The client filed a grievance against him less than a month before he won his first term as mayor of Fitchburg. Now, Gonzalez is facing his first election as incumbent mayor, running against Fitchburg city council member Aaron Richardson. “I firmly believe we need a Mayor that is reliable, accountable and treats citizens, staff and business leaders with respect,” Richardson said on Facebook. “There have been way too many instances of inappropriate behavior, comments and language over the past two years that is embarrassing to me as a Fitchburg resident.”","Fitchburg mayor’s past reveals suspension, grievance filed",UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/02/safe-spaces-acknowledging-privilege,"February 27, 2020 | 10:39am CST","In today’s classrooms, most students have probably seen and are familiar with signs saying, “This is a safe space,” or hear a professor utter the same words as they read through the course syllabus. But what does this mean, exactly?The Oxford Dictionary defines a safe space as “a place or environment in which a person or category of people can feel confident that they will not be exposed to discrimination, criticism, harassment or any other emotional or physical harm.” Usually, this has the implication of especially trying to be for those with marginalized identities to ensure they feel welcomed. At the most idealized it’s an attempt to foster the concept of being kind, considerate and respectful of others, regardless of whether one can empathize with their background.Creating the concept of a safe space is especially important in education, since the best learning happens when students are able to apply themselves fully, and are only able to do that when they can be completely open. The sphere of education isn’t just limited to in-person classroom environments either. Considering most students’ lives are heavily based around school, it can apply to all spaces, such as clubs, online discussion areas and social media. In fact, learning about safe spaces can be beneficial to students — as they may be able to apply the core ideas and values to broader aspects of their life. Need for safe spacesMore than one of every five students ages 12 to 18 report being bullied, according to a 2016 National Center for Educational Statistics report. Students reported most often physical appearance, race, gender, disability, religion and sexual orientation as reasons for being bullied.In establishing a learning environment as a safe space, students may feel more comfortable and respected, and therefore more able to learn. Additionally, there’s an opportunity for students to learn the importance of being inclusive of all students’ identities and backgrounds.Without a safe space, students — especially those with marginalized identities — can suffer. A Time article noted “a lack of safe spaces can also compound the mental toll of racism, even subtle racism,” and teachers may not recognize racial bullying because of how they perceive students’ interethnic relationships. While there are teachers that do attempt to provide safe spaces for their students — as they should — this is complicated by where bullying actually takes place, and who students turn to for help.For the 2014-’15 school year, 41 percent of students reported bullying took place in a hallway or stairwell, and 34 percent of students reported it took place in the classroom. And, a 2019 study also noted there’s been a steady increase in students experiencing cyberbullying at some point in their lifetime — from 18.8 percent in 2007 to 36.5 percent in 2019. Less than half of bullied students report notifying an adult about the incident. Of teenagers who experienced cyberbullying, 59 percent thought parents did an excellent or good job in addressing online harassment, according to a 2018 Pew Research Center study. However, 58 percent also thought teachers did an only fair or poor job in addressing online harassment, and 64 percent thought the same of bystanders.Regardless of students’ perceptions, teachers and other adults in education should attempt to provide safe spaces for students — ultimately teaching students to be respectful and inclusive, whether it’s in a classroom or online.Safe spaces in collegeSimilar to primary and secondary education, there is a need for safe spaces on college campuses. Yet, only 29 percent of U.S. college students want campuses to prevent certain speech that is offensive or biased to create “positive learning environments for all students,” according to a 2018 Gallup report.It also stated one in four college students reported they felt uncomfortable on campus due to comments they heard about their race, ethnicity or religion. At UW-Madison, one in 10 students reported there was at least one incident in which they were the target of hostile, harassing or intimidating behavior, according to a 2016 campus climate survey. Of those students, women, trans/non-binary, LGBTQIA+, students of color and students with a disability were more likely to have experienced at least one incident in which they were the target. Additionally, trans/non-binary, LGBTQIA+, students of color and students with a disability reported feeling safe, welcome and respected less often — and they were more likely to report feeling excluded.Hence, there is a need for safe spaces here at UW-Madison. While students — especially those of privilege — professors and other campus members should work collectively to create safe spaces, ultimately it’s up to the marginalized individuals to determine whether or not it’s safe for them. Perhaps what’s most troubling is the fact the campus climate survey revealed there were students who believed we should remove safe spaces. This belief is rooted in privilege and is completely ignorant of the experiences of marginalized students on campus. Safe spaces should continue to be encouraged, if not expanded, throughout UW-Madison — and in no way should be “removed.”Safe spaces and privilegeThe term “safe space” has been a hot topic in relation to college campuses especially. Most confusingly, it is often seen in opposition to the concept of free speech that is valued in academic environments. In a famous example from 2016, the University of Chicago Dean of Students sent a letter to incoming first years stating they would have no “safe spaces” or trigger warnings in honor of their “commitment to freedom of inquiry and expression.” The main issue with this argument is that it fails to take into account one of the biggest players in the presence of safe spaces: privilege. This is heavily tied to who creates the denoted “safe spaces” in the first place. Automatically, most classroom environments are already safe for students with privilege — that is to say, students who are white, straight, cisgender, abled and/or with monetary means. They are viewed as the default student, so the experience is already catered to them. Consequently, the experiences of marginalized students are overlooked.Making spaces safer for these students at a minimum requires others to acknowledge and confront their proximity to privileges and consider larger aspects of oppression at play. As a result, making spaces safer for marginalized students is perceived as somehow making spaces then unsafe for those with privilege, or limiting their free speech, by way of making them engage in difficult conversations. But arguing against “safe spaces” doesn’t get rid of them, it just keeps them safe for the people they were already safe for. Without making spaces safer for marginalized students, their “free speech” will always be compromised. They are already accustomed to their viewpoints, experiences and identities being challenged in everyday life, even if the same cannot be said for more privileged students. A safe space can work to reduce this challenge, ensuring there is a place actively made for those with marginalized identities.However, in claimed safe spaces created by professors and instructors — especially those who are white, straight, cisgender, etc. — there is still a tendency to act as though marginalized students aren’t in their classes. This is related to the idea a Harvard Political Review article discusses with academic-specific safe spaces, where the priority is having everyone speak. “In this type of space, people are still made to feel uncomfortable, yet it’s ‘safe’ to take intellectual risks and explore any line of thought,” Katherine Ho writes. But what if those lines of thought invalidate the humanity of other students? Many times, those students are already exposed to that, and having that viewpoint shared is not new or “challenging.” If the goal is for everyone to feel safe speaking, working collaboratively and just existing, measures need to be in place to ensure everyone also understands their words might directly affect someone. It also requires that the instructor be knowledgeable enough to step in and stand up for marginalized students who may not be comfortable speaking up.Cultivating safe spaces allows marginalized students to bring all of themselves in pursuing an education. It allows them to worry less about their identities being disrespected, or them being the only ones advocating for themselves. They are able to feel supported in their lived experiences, however much or little they choose to share.Overall, this can make their academic career more fulfilling. Safe spaces can also help facilitate difficult but important conversations in a way that’s both comfortable and educational for everyone, instead of limiting the identities and experiences of marginalized students. At the same time, these spaces do not aim to trivialize these students for their experiences.In the end, claiming a space is “safe” only goes so far as the work that is put into it, and it is up to individuals on whether that space is truly safe for them — and not hold it against them if they change their mind.In basic principle, calling for safe spaces isn’t asking to not engage in any difficult discussions whatsoever. It’s really just asking for more awareness of how privilege plays a role in academic settings, and for those with privilege to be conscious of how their actions and beliefs affect others.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/09/nasdaqs-diversity-rule-is-not-progressive,"September 16, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","On Aug. 6, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Nasdaq’s diversity proposal which intends to increase the number of women and minorities serving on corporate boards. Improving diversity on corporate boards is a laudable goal. But Nasdaq’s proposal will merely create a veneer of diversity without reducing discriminatory hiring practices.The new mandate requires public companies listed on Nasdaq to have at least one woman, as well as either a racial minority or someone who identifies as LGBTQ+ on their board of directors. Nasdaq companies are mandated to report and release updated board-level diversity demographics each year and provide an explanation if they fail to meet the requirements. While noncompliant companies will not be delisted, the rules increase the pressure to improve board diversity.Because gender-diverse boards are more profitable, supporters argue that the rules will benefit shareholders. Companies with diverse boards are reportedly 43% times more likely to have above-average profits. By requiring companies to change the demographics of their board appointees, it’s possible that Nasdaq may improve the performance of companies listed on their exchange.Supporters also argue that the disproportionately male and white boards are the outcome of discrimination. At the present, 81% of Fortune 500 directors are white, and 73.5% are male. In contrast, in America as a whole, four in ten citizens identify with a race or ethnicity other than white. It is deeply troubling that corporate leadership does not reflect the United States’ diversity. But Nasdaq’s policy is an inadequate fix to a complex issue. Instead of removing the discriminatory barriers keeping people from being successful, it forces an inefficient, top-down approach.As the majority of Americans agree, gender, race, sexual orientation and religion should not dictate what a person can and cannot do. When evaluating job candidates, we should reward merit above any external characteristics. If this was done properly, corporate leadership would be naturally diverse. The point is that hiring processes need to be reformed, instead of mandating outcomes that are themselves discriminatory.The new board diversity rule does not bring us closer to this goal. It is well documented that the board seat selection process is heavily reliant on personal connections. According to a 2017 study “Director Appointments ⁠— Is It 'Who You Know'?” over 75% of new director appointments had personal relationships with members sitting on the board. Sustained progress on board diversity necessitates the dismantling of this system. And as it stands right now, Nasdaq’s policy does nothing to change it.The rule also does not fix any underlying issues potentially contributing to inequality seen at the top levels of American leadership. It does not fix the underinvestment in minority schools, mitigate redlining, reduce the gap in higher education between the rich and poor or curtail workplace sexual harassment.Instead, it shifts the focus away from people’s intellectual might and professional contributions. It forces companies to evaluate a candidate by the color of their skin, by the gender they identify with and by who they are attracted to, over personal merits and capabilities.Further, corporate diversity mandates adopted in other countries have proved ineffective. In 2018, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) required all listed companies to have at least one woman on their board of directors. Rather than awarding qualified candidates, the majority of newly hired women were reported to be either family members of board directors or were unqualified for the job. It appears that the companies did not search for genuine female talent, and the policy decreased the effectiveness of their boards. The effects of a similar policy in the context of the United States’s culture will undoubtedly be different, but negative unintended consequences are a common result of mandates.If Nasdaq wants to increase corporate diversity, it should continue working to remove barriers to success. New businesses can be built from the ground up with diversity enhancing processes and practices. It could expand the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, an initiative that provides training and support for people starting new businesses. It could use its GoodWorks volunteering program to focus on tutoring students whose parents can’t afford private options. It could also mirror programs like YearUp and Grads of Life, objectives that provide resources to low-income individuals to help them climb the corporate ladder. These solutions are commendable because they are focused on helping individuals, not changing demographic statistics.In changing corporate leadership directly, Nasdaq should follow a voluntary approach. Rather than pushing companies that do not meet diversity standards to restructure, Nasdaq could celebrate the accomplishments of minority professionals and recognize companies who do hold diverse boards, like Milwaukee Women Inc in Wisconsin. Or it could find highly qualified board candidates and connect them with businesses looking for corporate boards, through initiatives such as TEMPO Madison’s Project REACH. These solutions draw attention to company policies it supports instead of naming and shaming those that fail to meet the determined diversity requirements.In a nation proud of its principles of individual rights, human equality and freedom of opportunity, corporate boards should not be so much less diverse than the American populous. . To be consistent with our values, Americans must work together towards reducing prejudice and discrimination.Nasdaq’s diversity proposal is not a solution. It does not move us away from a society focused on race and gender when it comes to hiring practices, it does not eliminate barriers to success and it carries potential unintended consequences. While Nasdaq’s efforts are commendable, if they want to improve diversity thresholds within their businesses’ leadership boards, Nasdaq should address the underlying problems keeping people, and great companies, from reaching their potential.Sarah Eckhardt is a junior studying economics and data science.

Pipeline 3, originally built in 1961, is a crude oil, specifically tar sand, pipeline which runs from Alberta, Canada through Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Canadian energy company Enbridge is now building a newer, larger, pipeline in its place that will be able to carry more oil. They have completed the segments through Wisconsin and North Dakota but are still in the process of construction in Minnesota. Enbridge claims that this will replace the existing pipeline, while movements against Pipeline 3, such as Stop Line 3 and Honor the Earth, believe that this will function as an additional pipeline as it will carry much more oil. Since the 1,700 mile-long Keystone XL pipeline project was halted once more through an executive order by U.S. President Joe Biden on his first day of office, some hope that new similar large-scale pipeline projects such as Pipeline 3 will also be canceled. Biden stated that the project would not be consistent with his administration’s climate policy standards. Stop Line 3 and Honor the Earth are still fighting to prevent the damaging effects the pipeline poses on sacred indigenous land and the environment. The pipeline’s construction is a destructive process of deforestation and damaging wetlands, and an oil spill from the pipeline threatens the well-being of the Anishinaabe tribe’s sacred wild rice and the Mississippi River’s watershed. The construction of Pipeline 3 is being called Enbridge’s “last attempt” by environmental activists and halting the project would create a transition away from US dependence on oil. Threat to Indigenous RightsSirkka Miller, a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is conducting a research project analyzing anti-pipeline activist groups, particularly with a focus on Line 3. According to Miller, Anishinaabe people were forced onto the reservations by the US government and now their treaty rights of control over their sovereign land are not being held up. The pipeline’s new corridor in Minnesota would violate treaty rights from 1842, 1854 and 1855 by cutting through five indigenous reservations of the Anishinabe Tribe. Miller said that this is “another violation that continues a pattern of cultural genocide” of the US government against indigenous culture. Joye Braun, otherwise known as Eagle Feather Woman, from the Lakota Tribe, said at an online meeting against Liberty Mutual, which insures Pipeline 3, that indigenous people are constantly being put at the forefront of environmental destruction such as the fossil fuel and coal industries due to systemic racism. Liberty Mutual refused countless requests to meet with indigenous leaders and the frontline community impacted by this insurance, according to Braun.“These [insurance] companies and the fossil fuel companies are digging new coal mines and building tar sand pipelines, like Line 3 and Trans Mountain, and expanding oil and gas drilling without the free prior consent of impacted indigenous communities,” said Braun. Indigenous women and children, in particular, are endangered by pipeline construction on reservations. According to data provided by the CDC in 2016, homicide is the third leading cause of death for American Indian and Alaska Native women under 20 years of age. Native Americans are also more likely to be killed by law enforcement than other racial or ethnic groups.In February, two Line 3 workers were arrested for human trafficking in Minnesota, one of whom was charged for soliciting sex with a minor. Furthermore, according to Stop Line 3, a non-profit near the Red Lake reservation that provides emergency services to sexual and domestic violence victims has had an increased demand for help since construction began on the Line 3 pipeline. The Violence Intervention Project submitted a document to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) that says local women and girls are getting verbally harassed by Line 3 workers.Environmental ImpactsMeline Leboucan, from the indigenous Cree Nation in Canada, said that there are multiple tar sand pipelines going through their land, and glaciers are drained to feed the pipelines which toxify the water. She showed photos of her and her family cleaning up a spill of 250,000 liters of oil from a pipeline in 2016, rather than Husky Energy, which owned the pipeline. Aliva Arredando, a climate and indigenous rights activist, gave a speech against Pipeline 3 at the Climate Strike on April 23. Leboucan explained the consequences of the environmental destruction on their territory, “Our family members have elevated rates of cancer, we have a toxic burden we carry for the global addiction [for fossil fuel] on our shoulders.”Enbridge infrastructures have been responsible for 1,276 liquid spills from 1996-2014 totaling 9,423,708 US gallons, causing detrimental environmental and safety issues.“Pipelines always break almost inevitably. Tar sand is especially harmful; it’s jam-packed with chemicals to keep it liquid,” stated Miller. Aliva Arredando, a climate and indigenous rights activist who spoke at the Climate Strike on the campus of the UW-Madison, stated that “Enbridge cannot promise that these pipelines won’t spill. They will. And that is detrimental because it is being built on hundreds of acres of Anishinaabe tribes. It will ruin their way of life.”  According to MN350, a climate change movement based in Minnesota, Pipeline 3 is projected to double the flow of the old pipeline as it will be replacing up to 370,000 more barrels of oil a day. The additional oil transported through Line 3 is the equivalent of the total CO2 daily emissions of 16- 18 million cars for every year the pipeline operates. Line 3 has an estimated cost to society of $287 billion in climate change-related damage over the next 30 years.Protests against the PipelineAliva Arredando went to two protest camps against Pipeline 3 this past winter in Palace, Minnesota.“It was all run by indigenous women and everything was very cryptic… They briefed us on what to do if you do get arrested and gave us personal bail information so they can bail you out,” she described.Liquid spills from Enbridge infrastructures in Canada and the United States from 1996 to 2014. In 2010, the Kalamazoo river spill from an Enbridge pipeline was the second-largest inland oil spill in the US of all time. Protests against the pipeline have been mainly led by the women of indigenous tribes, a group that is also disproportionately victims of violence. Claire Cambray, a student at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities has participated in protests against Line 3 for the past year. “When there [are] pipelines built thorough indigenous camps, the men's camps where workers live become hot spots for violence towards women, trans and non-binary people. There has been an uptick in missing and murdered indigenous women in the area,” she said.There are multiple protest camps along Pipeline 3, as well as protests in urban areas — such as the Twin Cities — to increase the issue’s notoriety, according to Cambray. In March, Cambray attended a protest where over a hundred people drove from the Twin Cities and different parts of the country. Iconic indigenous water protectors including Winona LaDuke and Tara Houska spoke at this event.“I had tears in my eyes because of the way they talked about the land and seeing the people who had come,” Cambray reminisced. Cambray was convinced to get involved in the pipeline protests after hearing that Line 3 was Enbridge’s last pipeline project in the works. “Hearing people say that it was a key battle makes it feel like a turning point,” said Cambray.Alternatives to the PipelineEnbridge’s website states that the pipeline is essential to deliver the crude oil needed by refiners and used by residents and that construction will create 8,600 jobs. Enbridge also claims the project will give a $2 billion boost to the Minnesota economy during design and construction, with $1.5 billion from Enbridge alone.In response to claims like these in favor of the pipeline, Sirkka Miller responded that “there are so many other ways to create jobs. We have to recognize that the federal government has the power to invest in green jobs, but it’s not being prioritized. Instead, they go to fossil fuel and coal manufacturing.”According to Miller, what is needed is a focus on the production of renewable energy for which the technology is already available. “Just because we’re addicted to this level of fossil fuel consumption now doesn’t mean we always have to be,” Miller explained optimistically.The question now lies in whether Pipeline 3 will continue construction or if the presidential administration will heed the calls of the people’s protests and intervene once again. “Pipeline 3 is the last chance to get tar sands out of Alberta. It is the biggest project in history in terms of the amount of oil being transported. If it were to be shot down, it would be the end of the tar sands industry,” said Miller.",The Fight against Pipeline 3,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/12/what-films-came-out-on-top-in-2011,"December 11, 2011 | 9:46pm CST","The end of the year, as well as the season's characteristic gold rush of high-caliber cinema, is upon us. And what better time to take in all the Oscar-minded flicks flooding into theaters or catch up on gems passed over from earlier this year than the glorious month of little-to-no responsibility that lies before us, just beyond that abysmal week-which-shall-not-be-named. While there are still a few films I'm highly anticipating over break-namely ""Shame,"" ""Young Adult,"" ""The Artist"" and ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy""-I'd still like to take this time procrastinating from studying to compile my top 10 of 2011 (so far) list.10. ""Attack the Block""An alien invasion movie like none you have ever seen before, ""Attack the Block"" oozes slick style and makes the most of its incredibly crafty screenplay by writer/director Joe Cornish. Part sci-fi action-thriller, part cheeky British comedy and part social commentary, this flick adds up to so much more than most of its genre-fluff peers.9. ""If A Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front""This documentary out of Sundance traces the origins of the eco-extremist group ELF, as well as the particular story of one member sentenced to an extended prison sentence for the arson of a lumber mill after being demonized by the U.S. government as a terrorist. The real issue this documentary tackles is not so much environmentalism as it is the way the government uses terrorism scare-mongering as a blank check for their own (corporate) interests.8. ""50/50""I doubt Seth Rogen, while writing the incredibly raunchy script for ""Superbad,"" ever seriously thought he'd be part of a best picture nominee about cancer, but that will likely be the reality very soon. Anna Kendrick (""Up in the Air"") and Joseph Gordon-Levitt deliver top-notch, comedic-dramatic performances alongside Rogen in a film that accomplishes a seemingly impossible task: making a movie about cancer that manages to be both deftly funny and pitch-perfect dramatic without crossing over into melodrama or tasteless humor.7. ""Midnight In Paris""Woody Allen is back at the top of his game with ""Midnight In Paris,"" the best piece of creative output from the writer/director I've seen in years. The cavalcade of celebrity cameos Allen puts together to play various famous historical writers and artists delighted the English major in me to no end. And the film's meditation on the value (or lack thereof) of having nostalgia for another age stuck with me long after I left the theater.6. ""Bellflower""Cardinal Music Columnist Alex Seraphin called the Coatwolf production team behind ""Bellflower"" ""the Fugazi of the film world"" and instantly declared it one of his top 10 movies of all time. While I wouldn't go that far, I'd certainly give Madison-native Evan Glodell's passion project a spot in my top 10 of 2011. The film is off the beaten path of usual Hollywood fair. It has incredibly naturalistic dialogue and performances, a story impossible to pigeonhole into a single genre and a inimitable aesthetic crafted by Glodell's homemade camera. Also, the fact that the entire production was shot for $17,000 makes this flick a testament to the rapidly-escalating prowess of the DIY-indie filmmaking scene.5. ""Like Crazy""Along will ""Bellflower,"" writer/director Drake Doremus' ""Like Crazy"" is a standard bearer for just what can be done in filmmaking these days on a comparatively tiny budget. Jason Reitman said it best when delivering the Sundance Grand Jury Prize, the festival's highest honor, to Doremus for this examination of young love tested by transatlantic distance  when he said, ""We liked this movie, like crazy.""4. ""The Guard""Part ""In Bruges"" part ""Hot Fuzz,"" ""The Guard"" is a unique blend of dark Irish humor, murder mystery and action flick. The surprising repartee between Brendan Gleeson and Don Cheadle crosses all boundaries of political correctness and makes this movie a pleasure to watch.3. ""Take Shelter""Michael Shannon's performance as a family man construction worker in rural Ohio plagued by nightmares of an impending apocalyptic storm in ""Take Shelter"" is utterly riveting on a scale scarcely seen these days, especially from such an under-the-radar actor. There's no doubt in my mind this movie will snag Shannon a best actor nomination on Jan. 24, and I would not be surprised to see him take home a statuette a month later.2. ""Ides of March""""Ides of March"" reminded me, if rather abstractly, of 2008's ""Doubt,"" a deserving film that was nonetheless deprived of a best picture nomination. While ""Ides"" loosely concerns the 2004 Democratic primary, while ""Doubt"" the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church, they both deal in uncertainty and carry the particular air of being adapted from plays, with a focus on performances over all else. George Clooney and Ryan Gosling bring their A-Game and will likely see best actor and best supporting actor nominations respectively, as well as best picture and best director nominations for Clooney.1. ""Drive""I could write volumes on every conceivable aspect of ""Drive""-the catchy soundtrack, the mind-bogglingly perfectionist cinematography, the outstanding performances, the masterfullyadapted screenplay-and have done so quite a bit already this semester. Suffice it to say, ""Drive"" is without doubt my favorite film of 2011, featuring my favorite performance of the year by Ryan Gosling. This action-packed, suspenseful drama is a sight to behold on the big screen, and I highly suggest that if you have any opportunity to view it in theaters over break, you do so. The small screen simply cannot do adequate justice to this masterwork of Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn.Have your own favorite flicks of 2011? E-mail David your list at dcottrell@wisc.edu.

Among the policies the committee is proposing the board’s auditors study is how crimes against minors are reported in the system.“We’re looking at really a pretty broad assessment of all the applicable laws, policies, rules and procedures that all address this one topic about reporting crimes against minors,” UW system spokesperson David Giroux said.According to the Board of Regents' December agenda, “in the wake of scandals regarding allegations of crimes against children at higher education institutions, it is essential to evaluate the adequacy of policies related to the reporting of crimes against minors.”Giroux said increased attention to crimes against minors has made members of the board think it needs to study the system’s policies and laws.“This is obviously an interest of every institution of higher education in the country that’s come into sharper focus in recent months, unfortunately, and we think its time to undertake a systematic, thorough review of those laws, policies, rules and regulations,” Giroux said.",Regents might review policy on reporting crimes against minors,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2011/04/womens-studies-will-reduce-gender-gaps,"April 12, 2011 | 1:00am CDT","What would happen if every student on campus were required to take a course in the department of Gender and Women's Studies? Would students brush the class aside like any other breadth credit or take the valuable information it offers seriously?It makes sense to incorporate such a class into the general graduation requirements at UW-Madison. Education is a positive step toward combating discrimination, as it builds empathy and understanding. It is an important tool used in exposing how prejudices affect society as a whole, and not just who discrimination is directed at.So would students benefit from including Gender and Women's Studies along with ethnic studies as a UW-Madison requirement? Yes. It's time the university took another step in reversing discrimination toward women. Educating people about social equality is vital to progressing efforts to close gender gaps.Although non-discrimination policies protecting women exist across the United States, women and women's issues are still attacked on a regular basis. Government funding for programs that protect or provide vital health care to women are often slashed, much like the recent but failed attempts to cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood.It's also disappointing that pay inequity between men and women persists today. It is another sign that our culture tolerates treating women as less valuable than men. Even though President Barack Obama vowed to work toward reversing this problem, it will require an entire shift in the way our culture thinks and operates on not only a local, but a national scale.Comparing international standards of living measurements with equality between men and women ultimately shows gender equality is linked to high living standards. The United Nations publishes two such measurements: the Gender Empowerment Measure calculates inequality between men and women and the Human Development Index measures standards of living. The 2009 GEM and HDI report the countries with highest GEM rankings (most equality between men and women) are also the twenty countries with the highest HDI rankings (highest standards of living). The United States is 12 by HDI and 15 by GEM.However, the vast majority of countries with low GEM rankings (little equality between men and women) are also countries that have low HDI rankings (low standard of living), linking low education levels with increased gender gaps.Without a belief in and a realization of equality, a community does not better itself. Yet the fact of the matter is there is still widespread culturally engrained prejudice in American society, which is not only seen through gender biases, but also through sexual orientation discrimination.The fact that LGBT youth have a higher suicide rate than other teens is evidence of the effects of homophobia.According to the Trevor Project website, LGBT youth are three times more likely than other teens to commit suicide—often the result of intense bullying or particularly vicious anti-gay attacks. It is disturbing that despite continued expansion of civil rights to LGBT people, suicide rates have gone up.According to the Center for American Progress, a disproportionate number of homeless teens, up to 40 percent, are LGBT while only about five to 10 percent of the entire youth population is LGBT. Without help, homelessness leaves LGBT youth in serious danger. About 58 percent are vulnerable to drug use, abuse and STDs in comparison to 33 percent of heterosexual homeless children.Public support and government policy helping LGBT homelessness is sorely lacking, however, should federal and state policy really be the source of change? No. Rather than just spend money to aid homeless youth, the source of the problem—prejudice—should be combated. To provoke real change, empathy and understanding need to be built from the bottom up instead of slowly trickling from the top down.These are morals and qualities that can be taught and better understood through Gender and Women's Studies courses. Classes that focus on minority issues will highlight problems that are affecting American society today.So, what would happen if every student were required to take a Gender and Women's Studies class?Well, the student body would be exposed to new ideas. The men and women at UW-Madison would walk together as equal peers and LGBT students would be able to come out, live openly and feel comfortable with themselves—free from bigoted attacks. Prejudice and discrimination may gradually diminish.I admit there would be a lot of moaning and groaning by students when adding another requirement to an already hefty courseload. I also realize plenty of students would probably blow the class off and look for the quickest and easiest passing grade possible, leaving without having learned anything. But that's not the point.Even if only half of the student body learns something new from a Gender and Women's Studies requirement, that's a step in the direction toward gender and minority equality, which is the real point. With this additional requirement, students would walk out of class more open-minded, with an outlook embracing individual differences rather than rejecting them.Michael Podgers is a freshman majoring in art history and German.

The dogs, which work as part of a pet therapy program called Pet Pals, visit sick children, even those who have been immuno-supressed because of chemotherapy or transplants.""""There have been a lot of parents that have said to us, ‘That's the first time I saw my child smile in a week,'"""" said Linda Sullivan, Pet Pals coordinator and review coordinator at the School of Veterinary Medicine at UW-Madison.In total, the program works with 25 dogs and visits approximately 1,000 children each year, Sullivan said. The program, which started making visits in 1996, crafted a medical protocol for testing dogs to ensure they would be safe around children who were hospitalized for more severe illnesses.Pet-assisted therapy, while still considered alternative therapy, is proving to have positive effects in the Madison area.Pet therapy and children""""There have been studies that have shown benefits for adults,"""" Sullivan said. """"Self-esteem increases, increased self-worth, general happiness, feeling of belonging, those sorts of things.""""But the lack of research into the emotional relationship between pets and children,allowed Pet Pals to fill that gap, Sullivan said. In fact, the Pet Pals program was part of research conducted by the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics that was published in a study called """"Play and Pets.""""The study revealed that the children involved in pet therapy displayed significantly more positive effects 57 percent of the time, than children engaged in child-life therapy.Toni Schriver, founder of Pawws to Heal, a non-profit organization that provides animal-assisted therapy to children who have suffered physical or sexual abuse, also believes pet therapy works.""""It's kind of like art therapy, where conventional therapy may not be reaching them, we use animals,"""" Schriver said.Pawws to Heal, like Pet Pals, is an outreach program that uses animals as tools to engage with children. While Pet Pals restricts their volunteers to temperament-tested dogs, Pawws to Heal works with a variety of animals.""""It's not like they come in and just play with the animals,"""" Schriver said. """"It's the dynamic of trying to re-establish social boundaries.""""Schriver works with two children every week and hosts programs on alternating months for 25-30 children. Davian, a child Schriver has been working with consistently for two and a half years, wouldn't even make eye contact with her when Davian first started engaging in pet assisted therapy. According to Schriver, after six months, Davian showed a lot of progress.""""He started opening up, he started interacting, he started engaging in activities,"""" Schriver said. """"And that's a huge step for a child that's endured the things that he's endured.""""Davian now helps as a mentor for other children in the Pawws to Heal program.Pet therapy and student lifeWhile Pet Pals and Pawws to Heal uses pet therapy specifically with children, Bob McGrath, coordinator of Mind, Body and Health at the University Health Services created Counseling Canines, a program that allows students to engage with animals therapeutically on campus.Ten to 12 staff-owned dogs who have been temperament-tested for Counseling Canines make an appearance each May during finals week, to help students relax, by serving as a stress reducer. During their two hours on Library Mall, the program usually sees about 400 students, McGrath said.But for Schriver, the relationship between humans and animals is something that cannot be recreated.""""It's like an unconditional trust, patience and love,"""" she said. """"You can beat the crap out of a dog and it will still be loyal to you and we can't understand why that is.""""Schriver says this can be characterized simply by a pet that shows happiness when its owner arrives home from work or school.UW-Madison junior Dan Wirz is familiar with the therapeutic effects of owning a pet.Wirz adopted Nanook, a Siberian husky, at the beginning of the school year before moving into a pet-friendly house on campus.""""Nanook is always there and happy simply because I am walking, talking and breathing, which is always reassuring after a long class day,"""" said Wirz.Like the dogs Pawws to Heal works with, according to Wirz, Nanook doesn't judge him.""""The only thing Nanook judges me for is not getting up fast enough when he wants to go on a walk,"""" Wirz said. """"But by the time I pick up his leash he's already forgotten.""""Facing obstacles on campusMcGrath considers pet therapy effective for students on the UW-Madison campus, however he recognizes its possible drawbacks.""""Pets can be a stress reducer,"""" McGrath said. """"But if you have to be responsible for [a pet], it can sometimes be a stressor as well, if you consider stress any demand on your time.""""However, Wirz finds Nanook helps him become more responsible about following his daily routine.""""Rather than waking up 15 minutes before class and racing, I have to consider the fact that [Nanook] is being affected directly by my scheduling,"""" Wirz said.Besides time management, McGrath sees other obstacles in housing on campus and the amount of space in apartments and residence halls.""""I think that's part of the student culture,"""" he said.But Schriver thinks that if students can financially support a pet, the experience would be very rewarding.""""You're still going to be stressed, you have exams and papers, but it's more of a calming effect,"""" she said.Sullivan saw this effect in a class at the UW School of Veterinary Medicine, as the students were able to interact with a service dog that accompanied a hearing-impaired student to class each day.""""I think that class was one of the happiest, most well-adjusted classes that we've had at this school,"""" Sullivan said.Pet therapy is still considered alternative, but unlike different types of stress management, Bob McGrath sees pet therapy as a relaxing and likeable activity.""""Our experience is that students really enjoy [pet therapy] and actually miss their pets a lot,"""" he said.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/03/grothmans-bill-promotes-warped-morality,"March 15, 2012 | 9:46pm CDT","State Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, received quite a bit of flack for the legislation he introduced last week condemning single parenthood. The discussion surrounding Grothman’s bill, SB 507, has focused on his idea that single parents are unqualified to raise children and are more likely to abuse them. However, much of the criticism overlooks what the bill is actually promoting rather than bringing down. SB 507 is not just an attack on single parents. This ideologically based attack extends far and wide in its scope.SB 507 specifically requires “the Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Board to emphasize non-marital parenthood as a contributing factor to child abuse and neglect.” In this case, non-marital does not necessarily mean the same thing as “single.” This includes co-habitating, unmarried parents. This also includes homosexual parents, who are not allowed to marry in Wisconsin..If the bill actively promotes marriage as the only legitimate source of stability for a child, then it promotes marriage over other lifestyles. The next problem lies in the fact that promoting marriage in a state where only heterosexual marriage is legal promotes a heterosexuality over other sexual preferences. Therefore, as well as stigmatizing single parenthood, this bill implies homosexuality is bad and homosexuals are more likely to abuse their children whether they are single or part of a couple or not.By advocating marriage, this legislation also condemns anyone having sex outside of marriage, which, as it happens, is a pretty large portion of Wisconsin’s population. In considering this bill, you must also take into account Grothman’s voting record. He is strictly pro-life and in favor of abstinence-only sex education. If comprehensive sexual education is bad, abortion is bad and now single parenthood is also bad, then Grothman either really likes adoption or has a serious problem with pre-marital sex. Signs seem to point to the latter.Grothman can believe whatever he likes; this is America, after all. However, SB 507 would require the Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Board, a government agency, to adopt these principles in their decision making and training as well.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/03/birth-control-equality,"March 5, 2012 | 8:33pm CST"," After recent attacks on women’s health and attempts to enact barriers between the general public and various birth control methods, the City Council from Wilmington, Delaware is fighting back.Birth control on the whole is a preventative measure; aside from condoms and abstention, the most frequently used birth controls are hormonal supplements which prevent a woman from ovulating. To clarify, birth control pills and vaginal rings are not abortion methods, nor can they function as such, and will not terminate existing pregnancies. However, the sensationalism surrounding these medications is giving them a far more controversial reputation, encouraging Americans to think of eggs as worthy of personhood rights. This view is made ridiculous by the satirical resolution formed by Wilmington’s City Council which reflects similar ideologies onto the male population, highlighting the absurdity of creating such laws in the first place and doing so without fully considering the female point of view.The resolution reads, “If every female egg is deemed by the government to be a living being…it follows that every sperm of a male should be likewise deemed by the government to be a living being.” It further states that men should be prevented from destroying their own semen, as this is a violation of the prospective personhood rights to be bestowed upon both eggs and sperm, and neglecting personhood rights for sperm would be a strike against equality between the sexes.Granting personhood rights is essentially equating every gamete to a dependent minor, thus depositing semen anywhere except a woman’s vagina would be considered the same as leaving an infant on the side of the road. So beware, hormone-frenzied males of Madison. This bit of “seminal” legislation could label you guilty of mass murder, child abuse and abandonment after one bout of lonely masturbation.Loretta Walsh, council member and author and sponsor of the resolution, could not have chosen a more acute or hilarious method to reveal the hypocrisy exhibited by today’s representatives and lobbyists. Restricting access to female birth control, which is not necessarily used for sexual purposes, based on religious beliefs while providing men access to birth controls that work in a similar manner (condoms prevent sperm from meeting eggs just as the pill prevents eggs from encountering sperm) is anything but American. In a country founded on equality and freedom, it seems odd that the only acceptable form of female birth control is abstinence while men have full access to commonly used spermicides, condoms and a variety of other treatments.Wilmington’s resolution calls on not only the state of Delaware but the entire U.S. government to create a bill promoting gender equality based on the resolution, an unlikely but interesting request. Instead of calling a press conference to bash their opponents, the Council is utilizing the measures their conservative counterparts have employed to show the duplicity that exists regarding these issues.Though the resolution is incredibly extreme, its intentions are clear. No bill need be passed for Walsh and her colleague’s point to be made; the rights of women must involve the voices of women.Kate is a freshman majoring in English and Spanish.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2012/02/logic-should-accompany-any-faith-in-politics,"February 26, 2012 | 10:06pm CST"," As a fan of one-sided debates and the usage of “eviscerate” in rhetorical contexts, I hope former Senator Rick Santorum wins the Republican presidential candidacy. The qualities that make him shine in his Republican supporters’ eyes—faith-based morality, focus on family values and strong stances on social issues—will make him unsuited for the presidential general election. Republican voters, egged on by conservative media, have increasingly turned to anti-intellectual politicians who do not equivocate their parsimony, or even know what those words mean. Instead of using logic, studies and statistics to support their controversial stances, Republican candidates, with Santorum as their current flag-bearer, continue turning to faith.Before I address faith’s necessary role in American politics, allow me to explain my own religious background. I was educated in a series of Catholic grade schools, but always struggled with religion. After the sexual abuse scandal that eventually bankrupted Milwaukee’s archdiocese, my parents and I stopped going to the occasional Sunday mass. I entered a Jesuit High School and studied theology along with other subjects. Eventually my questions regarding faith turned me away from religion altogether. It was a long process. Often times, when someone is religious, he or she rejects all other faiths; I just happened to reject one more than most.When candidates flaunt their faith, I am not put-off. However, the lack of discussion following their proclamations is worrying. When any candidate spews his or her faith-based stance, but does not explain it in terms that can be understood by any kind of faithful or unfaithful person, he is failing at politics. These types of unjustified assertions (faith cannot be a justification, because the basis of faith is that it requires none) are not unique to religion, but the political sphere is exactly where every single assertion needs to be examined and deconstructed. If someone starts using “God’s Laws” to effect my behavior, I will be just as skeptical if that person is a Pastafarian as if he is a Christian.This skepticism is what the American electorate can’t seem to accept. When Santorum quotes the Bible, he is picking and choosing which portions of the scriptures to propagate. There are hundreds of laws in the Bible, and when Santorum selectively applies them to daily life, he is the one who is affecting people, not God. Sticking to scripture also allows candidates to bypass the real human suffering laws can create or alleviate.Religious appeals only work when they are leveraged on people who accept the assumed religion, are totally fine with the candidate’s view of whatever theological concept is on display or are willing to accept the view without examining non-religious justifications. So when the Republican candidate (still keeping my fingers crossed for Rick), crosses into the presidential race, he is going to need to find a way to rationalize all that religious rhetoric into terms that everyone can understand. The hard-line conservative views on social issues are growing less popular, and voters are less willing to elect someone based on their social stances. In order to make up ground, the Republican candidate is going to have to do some rhetorical pirouetting.Religion will always be a part of American politics, but the relationship needs to be healthier.Candidates should be proud of their religion, and there should be a lot of examination of any candidate’s personal philosophy whether it is based on religion or not. Religion will always be a part of debates as well, but in order to keep things sane, religious justifications need to be backed up. Candidate’s who rally against contraception claim it hurts the integrity of communities, why not back that up with at least some anecdotal evidence? The truth is, candidates are already doing this to a degree, but when politics is reduced to sound bites, an appeal to “God’s Law” is about as forceful and concise as it gets. The electorate needs to encourage politicians to keep religion where it belongs, but we also need to look past religion if the media is doing a bad job covering a complex stance.So when Santorum says that “the First Amendment means the free exercise of religion and that means bringing people and their faith into the public square,” I agree; but his faith isn’t going to be enough when he is going up against an eloquent incumbent in debate.David Ruiz is a senior majoring in English.

Lang, a regular Misnomer reader who just happens to derive sexual pleasure from emotional and physical abuse, told Cardinal reporters that the article had, “ ...turned (him) on more than anything in (his) entire life.” Lang gave the Cardinal a detailed account of his first encounter with the piece. He described how his “pulse quickened” when he spotted the headline, and how he became more excited by each caustic remark he read. “My hands were shaking so badly I could barely click the ‘Read On’ link,” Lang said. By the time he reached the part about how Fake News Friday articles “read like a scared freshman dipping his toes in Lake Mendota... full of titters and nervous, unjustified fear,” Lang could no longer contain himself and reached a shuddering climax.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/09/childhood-stresses-may-trigger-the-later-onset-of-anxiety-in-girls,"September 2, 2013 | 11:45pm CDT","When exposed to high-stress situations, the normal physiological reaction is for the body to release a hormone called cortisol, which prepares people for a fight-or-flight response to the stressor. However, according to a study done at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the laboratory of psychology professor Seth Pollak, this reaction does not occur in girls who experienced physical abuse in their developmental years.The study stemmed from an experiment in which a group of boys and girls, ages 8 to 11, were placed in front of a panel of strangers and asked to do on -the-spot math calculations and give impromptu speeches. While most of the children responded to the situation with the expected cortisol rush, “there was a specific group from our experiments who did not follow the usual pattern, and in fact they followed the opposite pattern,” said Leslie Seltzer, a postdoctoral researcher involved in the study.The subgroup Seltzer was referring to was composed of girls who had a history of child abuse. Their hormonal stress reaction was an increase in a hormone called oxytocin, which influences people to form attachments and trust and is typically associated with more inviting, happier situations.This reaction reveals useful information about the coping mechanisms developed from early onset abuse, but the increase in oxytocin levels can also help explain patterns of more troublesome behaviors later in these girls’ lives.“We found that possibly, due to this reaction, girls who have this early experience engaged in sexual behavior earlier on, got pregnant earlier, and ultimately ended up more prone to riskier behaviors,” Seltzer said.In today’s society, these tendencies are often seen as socially unacceptable. However the researchers in Pollak’s lab argue that this release of oxytocin is actually an adaptive reaction developed over thousands of years to give people who’ve had these experiences a leg up to make up for the traumatic effects of the abuse.“We may not actually want to change this because it may actually be an adaptive strategy regardless of the fact that these behaviors are social ills of modern western society,” said Seltzer.Pollak’s lab discoveries of this release of oxytocin have also lead to new insight in other kinds of psychological studies. For example, research being done on the effects of dysfunctional adult relationships can now be explained in some cases by examining a person’s history of abuse instead of looking solely at his or her adult behavioral choices.“This is the first time that those kinds of hormonal patterns have suggested that it may not in fact be a result of their adult relationships but something developed earlier in life,” Pollak said.The reaction to the release of Pollak, Seltzer, and their colleagues’ findings created a lot of buzz on the popular social news website, Reddit. The press release received over 160,000 hits, which is more than any news story that has ever come out of UW-Madison’s website.“The comments on that Reddit thread I think are incredibly moving and telling and of course heartbreaking,” said Seltzer. “There are so many individuals who have suffered from the effects of physical abuse.”There are many situations in life that can lead people to engage in risky or somewhat negative social behaviors. Findings like those of Pollak and his colleagues can help predict which individuals are more likely to go down these paths, making it easier to administer help in dealing with them.Seltzer said on the future impact of their findings, “we hope that in the future we can discover the roots behind what we consider to be socially maladaptive social behavior and we can help more people later on.”",Childhood stresses may trigger the later onset of anxiety in girls,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2013/06/wisconsin-proposed-abortion-and-contraception-legislation-detrimental-to-womens-rights,"June 1, 2013 | 10:24pm CDT","On Wednesday, May 22, pro-choice and pro-life groups gathered in Wisconsin's State Capitol to debate a bill that made it into the legislature in just one short week. The bill, sponsored by Representative Andre Jacque (R-2), would make it much more difficult and expensive for a woman to get an abortion and would ban the use of public tax-payer dollars to fund abortions that fall under public employee's health insurance plans. It would also keep employers such as hospitals, schools and organizations with a religious affiliation from having to provide contraceptive coverage in their health insurance plans. These proposals are dangerous for Wisconsin's women. We completely understand that there are issues behind abortion, moral and religious, but the fact of the matter is the United States, since Roe v. Wade, has decided that women have a right to choose whether or not they will have an abortion—to a certain extent, of course. We don't say ""whether or not they want an abortion"" because no woman ""wants"" an abortion. It is not something that women want to do; in fact, many women have called it the toughest decision they have ever had to make. Most, if not all, women would completely rather avoid unwanted pregnancy through contraception, the second issue raised in this proposal. This bill would conflict with federal law as it is currently required federally that almost all public employers cover abortion in their health plans. A way that employers can currently avoid this is by self-insuring, setting aside a pool of money to deal with health claims. Supporters of this bill claim that public dollars should not fund something that some people morally disagree with. Though this proposal obviously does not outlaw abortion, it does make it harder and more expensive for women to have them. Rather than downright banning public dollars to cover abortion in health plans, perhaps it would be better to do what the bill plans to do, mistakenly, with contraception: keep certain employers from having to provide for abortions in their health plans. As for the second part of the bill, the part which would keep certain employers from having  to provide contraception in their health plans, this part is even more dangerous. Once again, employers are presently able to avoid having to provide funds for contraception through self-insuring. So, if employers really don't want to let women go crazy with their birth control (eye roll), they can. This, apparently, is inadequate as supporters of the bill claim that ""self-insurance isn't a real alternative in most cases because it's expensive and would result in reduced coverage and increased costs for employees."" Nicole Safar of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin told the Assembly Health Committee that more than 90 percent of women use contraceptives, which is one of the most responsible decisions a woman can make. Otherwise, logically one would see that we could have many more abortions—probably even illegal ones—unwanted pregnancies and an even greater problem with overpopulation in the United States. All employers should be required to provide for contraceptives regardless of their moral values. Why is this? An employee is not required to use the contraceptives. If an employee's moral values do not conform with the use of contraceptives, there is no law saying they must use them. It's not a matter of morals, it's a matter of women's health and making it an exemption from health care coverage is discriminatory to women, primarily the 90 percent of women who use contraceptives. It seems to me that a group who is against abortion should want to prevent abortion as much as possible. We can tell you right now that making contraception not as easily accessible will not help this cause. The parts of this bill seem to contradict each other and we wonder where the real motivations lie. Similarly, it is not the role of the state legislature to legalize morality. Regardless of creed, race or any other identification trait, the government does not have the right to prohibit an individual’s access to medical supplies simply because it is not the will of a religious organization that operates entirely apart from our government. The right to practice one’s own religion is undeniably protected, yet the right to separate oneself from religious practices is oftentimes ignored. To sacrifice the right to contraception, which reduces the probability for domestic abuse, neglect and poverty, because of an unwillingly accepted moral code implemented by an employer is just as equal of an injustice as religious intolerance. We find it hard to believe that if the situation were reversed and this bill affected men’s rights, that it would be passed. While the idea of an independent woman making her own sexual decisions outside of any religious belief may be threatening to the “family values” agenda that has overtaken the Republican platform, the fact of the matter is that these women do in fact exist and contribute to our society. It is also overlooked that many married, religious couples choose birth control to plan their families. Having children responsibly or not having children at all should not be luxuries merely for those who can afford them, especially when an employer has absolutely no right to control his/her business in a way that affects the personal decisions of the employees in terms of their sexual decisions. They’ve declared this bill as a declaration of “religious rights.” In actuality, it’s the rights of the individual outside of religion that are being attacked.",Wisconsin proposed abortion and contraception legislation detrimental to women's rights,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/all-hail-the-sexual-ambiguity-of-kalinda-sharma,"October 29, 2014 | 11:15pm CDT","I’ve recently started binge watching “The Good Wife,” one of CBS’ hour-long prime-time dramas. While I’d heard of the show before, it wasn’t until I saw Julianna Margulies’ speech after winning her second Emmy Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series that I thought I should give the show a try.After my incessant viewing of the legal drama, I was saddened to hear one of the show’s excellent female characters, Kalinda Sharma, would be leaving at the end of the current season. Sharma, played excellently by Archie Panjabi, has consistently been one of the shows most powerful characters, a role that netted Panjabi an Emmy for Best Supporting Actress.Panjabi, the British-born daughter of Indian immigrants, made her first major appearances in “Bend it like Beckham” and “A Mighty Heart.” But it’s on “The Good Wife” where Panjabi hits the ground running with an amazing portrayal of the rebellious, yet productive, private investigator. Sharma is headstrong yet understood, known for wearing knee-high leather boots in every scene and is more of a badass than any of the male characters on the show.Throughout the first season, Sharma is shown having sexual relations with both men and women, but her sexuality is never fully addressed on screen. It wasn’t until the season finale when Margulies’ character, Alicia Florrick, asks her outright, “Are you gay?” Kalinda’s answer is brief, yet effective: “I’m private.”These two words perfectly identify Sharma’s overall character on the show. At work, she’s a hard worker, using her sexuality and personality to get information for Lockhart-Gardner’s lawsuits, but she tries to keep her personal life at an arms length when it comes to her colleagues. While this doesn’t stop her from having sex with Cary Agos, an associate who leaves to work at the Illinois State Attorney’s office, Sharma doesn’t see the reason to disclose personal information to her coworkers.It isn’t revealed how Sharma identifies herself sexually until the end of the fourth season, when she tells Alicia at the bar, drinking tequila, that she’s “flexible.” This labeling, or lack there of, is another example of how Sharma doesn’t need to have outward labels placed upon herself, and that she can decide who she is.In the show’s fourth season, an abusive husband comes into the picture, a man whom Sharma left in Canada before coming to work at the Lockhart-Gardner. Her husband follows her around, and ends up finding Sharma’s current female fling. As the man tries to lay roots in Chicago and state his dominance over Sharma, she dispatches the lawyers to help prevent him from doing so, which they are successful in doing.This privacy of her past is what makes Sharma one of the show’s most likeable characters. While most of the series leads have various parts of their personal lives revealed through various story lines, Sharma’s work on keeping her life away from work allows for her to have relationships with women from the United States Justice Department and the FBI.Sharma’s expression of her sexuality also puts her in an interesting place among television’s roster of LGBTQ characters. While rarely shown in a relationship, the show places Sharma in the same caliber as heterosexual male characters, at least sexually. She uses her attractiveness for personal satisfaction and for the benefit of her firm, and easily castes off men or women for whom she no longer has use.This characterized shift of a queer character shows some changes in the way in which adult queer characters are portrayed on prime time television. “Glee” and “The Fosters” have very different ways in portraying their queer characters, but Sharma is miles apart from how NBC’s “The New Normal” and ABC’s “Modern Family” portray their queer characters. Keeping the character’s sexuality from being a focal point of their characterization isn’t necessary, but refreshing.Sharma’s departure from the show will be hard to replace, because a queer woman of color isn’t yet normality on prime time. “The Good Wife” will still hold a place on critics’ lists as a great drama, but fans will miss one of the most developed, yet private, characters on television.Are you a fan of Kalinda Sharma?

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/10/foreign-surrogacy-births-problems-not-solutions,"October 21, 2014 | 11:45pm CDT","It is quite evident that we now live in a world of advanced technologies. One of the technological glooms of today is the use of surrogacy which is the practice of using another woman to carry the baby instead of the actual parents through implantation of their embryo into her. Many of us are already aware of this technology as Hollywood celebrity Sarah Jessica Parker was widely known for using a surrogate mother for the birth of her twin daughters back in 2009. But surrogacy is increasingly becoming more controversial in developing nations as it is commercialized without proper law enforcement to prevent abuses like here.A New York Times article on Aug. 26, 2014, revealed more about the shadowy surrogate business in Thailand. There is a reason why surrogacy is more popular and gloomier there. Thailand is one of few countries in Southeast Asia that lawfully allows commercial surrogacy and many are hired by couples from wealthier countries like Australia and the United States to carry babies instead of the actual parents. The inherent pursuit of this business is good because it allows infertile people to have their own children and pay money to people in need to earn money in a relatively short time. However, this practice is becoming very controversial as more people are abusing this technology.           One Australian couple that had twins through a surrogate mother in Thailand decided to only take one of the children because the other baby was born with Down Syndrome. The father indicated, “I don’t think any parent wants a son with a disability.”  This case became even more problematic when court records revealed him to be convicted and imprisoned 20 times for sexual abuse of children in the 1990s, questioning his fatherhood ability and rights to even use surrogacy. Another dreadful case was discovered recently when the police raid in Bangkok clinics found that a Japanese man had fathered approximately a dozen babies through surrogates within weeks and months apart. The misuse of the practice in Thailand is raising concerns about the commercialization of the surrogacy business.Many Thai women from rural regions are attracted to the surrogate business in order to earn money for survival and better lives. Most people who pay for the surrogacy are from developed nations. This shows the glooms of a globalized economy because it is overcoming the social moral that all of us consider important; that it makes humans a commodity and the subject of trade. Human lives are being traded whether the outcome may be potentially beneficial for both parties or not. Then the question rises, should surrogacy really be commercialized even when it, to some extent, violates the basic human norm of globalized trade?But there are more problems than just the moral contradictions. The problem rises in legal fields; whether the foreign couples that pay for this could successfully bring their child out of countries lawfully. In Thailand, the legal definition of a mother is the woman who carried the baby physically. So, in order for the foreign couples to take their children into their care legally, they need to have surrogate mothers give up their rights of children, which could involve the rather complex process in the courts that may force both parties to rely on the illegal methods to solve the issue, such as passport forgeries.Or even worse, the surrogates could be left behind with their non biological children because the foreign couples could change their minds, which become very convenient for them since the legal status for the mother in that country is the one who carried the baby. This becomes very difficult when the surrogate mother, who possibly came into the business to make money, is forced into further economic burden and moral guilt for using contradictory practice with no paybacks. Also, this practice is usually happening in the legal gray areas, where there are no laws in preventing the abuse of the practice or helping victims of the practice. The practice of surrogacy could hardly be good, especially for surrogate mothers, when there are no legal controls for it to guarantee effective solutions or preventions for the potential problems.Surrogacy is not only the moral erosion of humanity, but also the stigma of poverty and inequality for the powerless. Even if there are benefits to the issue, when the other party is forced into potential danger and misery without proper protections, this practice could hardly be the true reproduction of human lives, but the destruction of pre-existing lives.Hae Rin is a freshman writer for The Daily Cardinal.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2014/02/we-must-not-forget-russias-political-problems-amidst-the-splendor-of-the-winter-olympics,"February 11, 2014 | 11:17pm CST","Hurrah! The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi last week (cue Olympic Fanfare), demonstrated our strong international unity while at the same time put on our ardent nationalist spirit. Of course, with the honor of the attention of the entire world, no other nation has the ability to express its pride and history more than the host nation, which, in this case, is Russia.Certainly, there have been some bumps and some PR issues plaguing Russia’s nationalist demonstration. There’s the story of the extermination company hired to poison Sochi’s stray dogs, the infamous incompletion of the journalists’ hotels, and—my personal favorite—the glowing snow flake that failed to blossom into an Olympic ring during the opening ceremony (#SochiProblems). Alas, all host nations have difficulties fulfilling the monumental task of putting on this magnificent event, and Russia, threats of terrorism aside, has risen to the occasion. The opening ceremony of the 2014 Games in Sochi certainly exhibited the nation’s artistic creativity and complexity (even if it glossed over Lenin, Stalin, and the rest of Russia’s dark history), symbolically proving its status as an elite nation in the world.Yet the prestige of the Olympic Games often serve as an insidious political tool, establishing greater respect for the host state as I suggested above, as a way to purify its image despite its past—or current—actions. Suffering from its reputation as a politically restrictive, even vicious, Communist regime (I’ll refer you here to Tiananmen Square in 1989), China used the Olympics to recreate its international image when it hosted them in Beijing in 2008 and to show its serene and intricate culture. This, too, is something Russia seeks to do in Sochi, and it’s something the international community should not let Russia so easily get away with.Russia has suffered serious political blowback on a number of issues in recent history. Perhaps the most popular and identifiable issue is its passage and implementation of a set of egregiously homophobic laws that ban the distribution of “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations” among minors, effectively crippling the ability of LGBT couples to pursue their relationships or even to be openly gay within Russia’s borders. World leaders everywhere expressed their disdain for Russia’s codified bigotry, and there was even outcry for the United States to again boycott these Games. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, of course, mollified growing concerns over the law, proclaiming gay athletes welcome in Sochi. Should all go well, these troubles will blow over with a well-executed Olympics on the mind of the world.But Russia’s anti-LGBT agenda shouldn’t be the greatest concern for the international community; rather, Russia’s anti-democratic involvement in the Ukraine is the most immediate problem on the international agenda. Last year, the Ukraine’s president rejected his sweeping promise, a promise the Ukrainian public wholeheartedly supported, to sign a set of agreements further uniting the country with Europe and helping to bail it out of its economic crisis, instead buckling under Russia’s stringent pressure to keep the country from joining with the West. In response, massive protests have ensued in the capital city of Kiev, and the country now finds itself on the brink of civil war. Russia, in effect, triggered this tragic violence again in Eastern Europe, one the world’s most conflict prone regions, in an attempt to hold its political control—an action the international community should not tolerate or ignore.In two weeks, these Olympics Games will have ended, and we in the United States will be very happy because we will again have returned home with the most medals (but actually, it’s going to happen). Still, after the warm and fuzzy, feel-good conclusion, we can’t let Russia surreptitiously shrink away from these gaping political problems. The media, of course, is partly responsible to make this happen. It’s our job to keep these topics relevant and in the news so that people like you don’t lose track of them. However, part of the responsibility is yours—not as a citizen of any city, state, or nation but as a citizen of the world. You have a duty not simply to remain informed but also to act—to call on Russia and hold it responsible for these obscene abuses of power. Only consistent, intensive international pressure will prevent Russia from again perpetrating these acts.

Resulting from experiences of traumatic events, PTSD is characterized by intense recurring flashbacks and high emotions of fear when the patient is overly triggered by a normally mild stimulus.Both military veteran and civilian populations are affected by this illness as PTSD can result from combat traumas in addition to noncombat traumas such as sexual abuse, early childhood abuse or accidents.For war veterans especially, who are returning from recent American military engagements, post-traumatic stress disorder is growing more and more common. Although PTSD is a growing problem on the agenda, the treatments available for victims of PTSD are limited.Vaishali Bakshi, an associate professor of psychiatry at the UW-Madison School of Medicine, currently studies mental illnesses including posttraumatic stress disorder.“Right now, we don’t have good treatments for PTSD,” Bakshi said, “There are some cognitive behavioral strategies that help a little bit, but there is no gold standard drug treatment like there is for something such as clinical depression... there is a very, very dire need for [PTSD] medication.”Bakshi’s lab recently published a new paper describing their discoveries of the underlying mechanisms that cause PTSD. Through the ingenious predator stress model, Bakshi’s former graduate student Abha Rajbhandari, the paper’s first author, was able to identify the mechanism. Bakshi’s predator stress model is remarkable in that the researchers were able to use rats to simulate the course of PTSD and observe how their brain changes as a result of psychological trauma.In the model, the rats were placed into protective cages, which were then placed inside a cage with a ferret, a natural predator of rats. Although the ferret could not touch or harm the rat, the rat was still able to hear, see and smell the ferret. As a result of this exposure, the rats were extremely stressed by the situation.“The common element you hear from [PTSD] patients is that during the traumatic events that triggered their illnesses, in those moments, they felt like their life might end,” said Bakshi. “I really believe that this predator model is the closest possible way to model that naturalistically. The ferret is never going to touch [the rat], but the rat doesn’t know that. For all intents and purposes, the rat thinks that it might die because the ferret is its predator. The fact that it was a completely nonphysical stimulus, but rather a pure psychological stimulus was another strength of the paradigm. It honed in on the underlying active mechanisms of PTSD.”Bakshi’s predator stress model was able to closely engender the behavioral over-reactivity and sensitivity that are seen in PTSD patients and as such, the researchers were able to translate their findings to apply to PTSD in humans.Rajbhandari looked at the brains of the rats exposed to trauma and discovered that the basolateral amygdala, the “fear center” of the brain, had an overactive response of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. In the system, the norepinephrine receptors had become hypersensitized, which was directly causing symptoms of PTSD, which include exaggerated startle responses.Furthermore, she was able to pin down a protein called CRF and the neurochemical norepinephrine as the neurotransmitters, which started the entire chain of events.CRF and norepinephrine both cause stress and arousal responses in the body, but based on the findings of this study, it appears that the hypersensitivity of norepinephrine receptors to these chemicals leads to the high stress and fear PTSD patients experience.“Even a little amount of norepinephrine that normally would not cause any behavioral changes was able to produce an exaggerated response in rats that were exposed to the predator model of trauma,” said Rajbhandari.Their groundbreaking results greatly advance our understanding of how PTSD occurs and opens the doorway for finding drug treatments for PTSD.Since a solid mechanism has been deciphered by their study, it is now possible to begin drug development that can target this PTSD mechanism.One possibility is using the model to identify other chemicals that modify sensitivity in the brain. Bakshi believes that it could even be possible to find drug treatments that could prevent PTSD by targeting the neural pathways shown to mediate the development of PTSD-like symptoms after trauma exposure.The growing prevalence of PTSD in our population makes the results and ramifications of this study even more important. PTSD patients suffer debilitating effects upon their lives similar to patients with heart disease or diabetes, a fact often not realized due of the stigmatization of mental illnesses. An eye-opening discovery like Bakshi’s and Rajbhandari’s can both help destigmatize mental illness and improve lives of those afflicted with PTSD.",PTSD predator stress model reveals overactive neurotransmitter response,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/02/fifty-shades-of-grey-defies-typical-hollywood-style,"February 16, 2015 | 9:38pm CST","I hate to give the best-selling book and box office hit movie, “Fifty Shades of Grey” any more time in the spotlight, but there are a few things that need to be said before the movie becomes old news.Here are the facts: “Fifty Shades of Grey” exploded at the box office this weekend, with a rousing estimated four-day gross of $94.4 million. The Fifty Shades’ climactic box office eruption isn’t much of a surprise—the E.L. James book on which it’s based is a global phenomenon that famously boasts a readership of some 100 million worldwide. According to data provided by Universal Pictures, the domestic audience for the film was also predictably skewed toward women: 68 percent female versus 32 percent male. Another fact that should be mentioned is the book and movie center on a relationship based on bondage, domination, sadism, masochism (BDSM), manipulating emotions and controlling actions.What we should be focusing on is the fact that this movie is focused primarily on women—both as characters and as ticket buyers. It seems as if Hollywood is now starting to realize the impact women have on the world and can have at the box office. We should not be shocked if we begin to see a surge of female-driven movies as a result of the molasses-slow pace at which Hollywood reacts to change.The magnitude of this very welcome growth should not be overstated. Women are still woefully underrepresented in directors’ chairs, and the overwhelming heterosexual whiteness of the characters in Hollywood is rather impossible to ignore. On both scores, television—which operates at a much faster decision-making metabolism—is already light years ahead of the movie business, with several ratings hits featuring people of color and being driven (both behind and in front of the camera) by women. I am not saying that a relationship depicted in the film “Fifty Shades of Grey” nor any aspects of the book are “getting” women, but I am saying that it is time for women to watch what they want to watch without judgment.When the movie came out Feb. 14, many were quick to criticize the film for its soft-core-porn qualities and erotic nature. There were countless articles dealing with the fact that an emotionally manipulative and abusive relationship was being shown on the silver screen (no pun intended). Yet no one thought to think of the countless other movies and art forms that depicted the same thing when the target audience is men: adult magazines, adult films, obscene literature, and sexually explicit art.I am not endorsing the movie “Fifty Shades of Grey” for being Oscar worthy, nor am I saying it is realistic to women’s desire for abusive relationships. I am merely pointing out a fact that many seem to be missing when it comes to this film.Why is an erotic film geared toward a female audience  slammed for depicting sexual abuse? All the while, no one is as quick to judge the countless other “films” and “movies” with the same premises of abusing women, BDSM, and manipulating emotions that is geared toward a male audience?Lilly is a freshman writer for The Daily Cardinal. Do you agree with her stance on women and their roles in Hollywood? Is there a point she may have over looked? We would like to hear your view.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2015/01/big-ten-regains-its-national-prominence,"January 19, 2015 | 10:43pm CST","Juggernaut Ohio StateThe Buckeyes are back. Ohio State’s dominant performance against Oregon in the first national title game of the College Football Playoff era was a mark of resurgence not only for the Big Ten, but also for the championship culture in Columbus.The span of time between Ohio State’s last national championship in 2002 and its 42-20 mauling of the Ducks Jan. 17 was trying for the program. The 13-year stretch saw the infamous tattoo scandal, two coaching changes, a frustrating 6-7 season in 2011 and a perfect record in 2012 that was essentially nullified by an NCAA-imposed postseason ban.Head coach Urban Meyer has effectively erased the memories of that tumultuous period from the minds of the Buckeye faithful. Meyer has amassed a 38-3 record since he took over in 2012, and he has Ohio State primed to remain at the top of the Big Ten for the foreseeable future.Ohio State retains three capable quarterbacks, four starting offensive linemen and seven defensive starters from its championship team. With Meyer at the helm and the core of the roster back in 2015, there’s no reason to believe the Buckeyes won’t again be in the hunt for another playoff berth and national championship next year.—Jake PowersMichigan gets its manThe day after the NFL season came to a close, the biggest coaching hire in recent years took place: Jim Harbaugh, the coach of the relatively successful San Francisco 49ers, was leaving pro football to go back to coach at his alma mater, the University of Michigan. Not only does such a high profile coach elevate the school, it elevates the conference as a whole.In the months preceding the move it had been speculated by writers in the Ann Arbor area, but most of the national NFL writers scoffed at the idea of an NFL coach “demoting” himself. It was a move they didn’t understand, but one that college fans and writers get: The excitement, rivalries and emotion wrapped up in the college game is very different than the NFL, and Harbaugh is an emotional guy, to say the least.Harbaugh has proven to be a successful coach at the collegiate level, taking the perennially average Stanford into national prominence. Now, imagine what he can do with the resources available (and lower academic standards) at a historically relevant powerhouse like Michigan. If given time, he could develop a program in the vein of what his rival school Ohio State has done with Urban Meyer.If this is the case, expect another hotly contested period in one of college football’s greatest rivalries, mirroring the glorious “10 Year War” between Woody Hayes and Bo Schembechler that ran from 1969-’78. This level of competition would surely sway the national media away from the SEC, if only for a week.—Andrew TuckerThe best win their bowlsThe Big Ten’s 6-5 bowl record this season may seem slightly underwhelming. It was worse than both the Pac-12 (6-3) and the SEC (7-5), and only the ACC (4-7) had more losses.However, the Big Ten accomplished that record by winning at the top. For each of the past 10 seasons, either Ohio State, Wisconsin or Michigan State have won the conference outright or clinched at least a share of the Big Ten title.Thanks to the recent downfalls of both Michigan and Penn State, the Buckeyes, Badgers and Spartans are the undisputed top three programs in the Big Ten right now. They combined to go 4-0 this bowl season, thanks to Wisconsin’s back-and-forth win over Auburn, Michigan State’s wild comeback against Baylor and Ohio State’s dominating wins over Alabama and Oregon.Let’s be honest—does anyone really care how Illinois fared in this year’s Heart of Dallas Bowl? The conference’s bowl record isn’t composed of bottom feeder victories while the most prominent teams collapse on the national stage. Instead, the three current faces of the Big Ten helped put the conference back on the map.—Jim DaytonPenn State sanctions endPenn State defeated Boston College 31-30 in the Pinstripe Bowl in its first postseason appearance since receiving a short term death penalty from the NCAA. Following the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse scandal, Penn State was given a four-year bowl ban and had access to just 40 of 85 scholarships. These sanctions, handed down in July 2012, were lifted by the NCAA last September, making the Nittany Lions bowl eligible in the 2014-’15 bowl season. In addition, Penn State’s coaching staff will have all scholarships available for the 2015 season. As a result, Penn State is not only back on the Big Ten map, but the national map as well. While the scandal was devastating to the Nittany Lions’ program and will forever leave a black mark on the university, Penn State football is still Penn State football and a return to a perennial Big Ten powerhouse is now inevitable. After all, in Joe Paterno’s era, the team won two national titles, four Orange Bowls and six Fiesta Bowls. Second year head coach James Franklin, who turned around a below average Vanderbilt program in three years, has the ability to recruit top players from around the nation. Playing in front of over 100,000 passionate fans in Happy Valley under an enthusiastic young coach should be more than appealing for recruits. All of this adds up to a resurgent Penn State program, which will soon become contenders in the already loaded East.—Bobby EhrlichMore new coachesWhile the prodigal son’s return to Ann Arbor got far and away the most media attention (and rightfully so), a couple of other Big Ten powerhouse programs, Wisconsin and Nebraska, each hired new head coaches in December.The Badgers lured Pitt head coach and former UW offensive coordinator Paul Chryst back to Madison, with the hope that, unlike Bret Bielema and Gary Andersen, he’ll be staying at Wisconsin until he retires. The Badgers have been one of the conference’s premier programs in recent years and hiring Chryst will keep them competing for Big Ten titles on an annual basis.Nebraska, on the other hand, shocked just about everybody when it brought in Oregon State’s Mike Riley to succeed the fired Bo Pelini. While he wasn’t the splashy hire most Cornhusker fans were hoping for, Riley is unquestionably a solid coach who found success in Corvallis, a place that had been the breeding ground for Pac-12 futility for years before his arrival. Whether or not he can take the Cornhuskers to a level that Pelini was unable to during his seven-year tenure remains to be seen, but the additions of Riley, Chryst and Harbaugh are all major positives for a conference that appears to be on the upswing.Now if Iowa finally puts Kirk Ferentz out to pasture and escapes its rut of perpetual mediocrity, the Big Ten will really be in business.—Zach RastallBut is all this for real?The Big Ten had a good New Year’s Day. The days surrounding New Year’s were pretty good too. But that week-long period doesn’t change a multitude of factors that have kept the tide against Midwestern college football for decades.Let’s talk recruiting. Every team in the Big Ten save a couple is bad at it right now when compared to an average SEC school. It’s not necessarily their fault, but it’s also something that’s not going to change any time soon. The Pac-12 has California for a primary recruiting ground, the Big 12 has Texas and the SEC has the entire South. The Big Ten has… Ohio, which is a good football state but nowhere near enough to sustain a major conference. Going off 247Sports’ football recruiting rankings, 22 of the 35 five-star recruits in the country are located in states containing SEC schools. Two are in Big Ten states.If the Big Ten wants to be truly “back,” it’s going to need several coaches who can recruit nationally, not just two with Urban Meyer and Jim Harbaugh.The Big Ten had a good winter, but let’s not confuse Meyer assembling a juggernaut with a fundamental change in conference hierarchy. That’s going to require something special.—Jack Baer",Big Ten regains its national prominence,UWM

The festival does not play coy with its appeal. While far from unsafe, the rowdy atmosphere of the event still harkens back to its first years when near-riots attracted attention from police armed with pepper spray. Even with unruly behavior, attendees appeared to wholeheartedly appreciate the music and sights the event had to offer.Upon entering the gates, the crowded State Street corridor moving to the main stage at Capitol Square was lined with unexpected moments. Groups of students weaved through the crowds with efficient intent, making impressive time as they flowed toward the different stages. Groups of Clark Kents and Ricks with their Mortys compared their costumes in hilarious displays of one-upsmanship. Others forwent costumes in favor of comfort, wearing flannels and jackets, unapologetically going to Freakfest for the music alone. A strained clown on stilts squatted to pose for pictures until he became unbalanced and fell to the ground. The spontaneity many experienced on the street raised the question “Where else, but Freakfest?”When the yells and heated discussion died down for brief unscripted pauses, a dense and varied soundscape emerged. Between the Country Stage and the Mountain Dew Stage the sounds of several events met. The crowd at the intersection of Johnson and State experienced an odd assortment of sounds simultaneously. Har Mar Superstar’s sexually charged R&B meshed with Greta Van Fleet’s energetic twang, resulting in a head-spinning cacophony.While some attendees came for a specific act, the audience was receptive to new sounds and ideas. Outside the Overture Center, a crowd gathered around an artist playing a rousing solo on the saxophone. When the artist breathlessly completed the solo the audience gave staggering applause. An appreciation for music outside of the mainstream continued on the main stage. The soulful wailing of St. Paul and the Broken Bones, an act that was largely unknown to many attendees, attracted a surprising crowd. The audience embraced unexpected new sounds with positivity and excitement, showing a willingness to expand their musical boundaries.Unfortunately, this openness came at a cost. Audience members often resorted to aggression to ward off the busy crowds. On several occasions, attendees raced and bickered to get selfies with elaborately costumed characters. Groups fought viciously to get closer to the front. When pushed, the packed crowd pushed back, causing waves of attendees to fight for their footing. Substance abuse was blatant, sometimes belligerently so. The disorderly nature of the crowd made some moments of fun feel unnecessary and contrived. However, when artists took the stage, attendees dropped the pretense of aggression to simply enjoy the music.At Freakfest 2016, attendees showed appreciation for new and different sounds and experiences, but were less open-minded in their conduct. The festival was full of fresh and unexpected moments. Unfortunately, you often needed to fight to experience them.",State Street bustles in costumes and candor,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/09/rimes-excites-fans-with-season-premiere,"September 26, 2016 | 10:24am CDT","‘Tis the season for Shondaland’s hit shows to return. “Grey’s Anatomy” and “How to Get Away with Murder” began new seasons Sept.22, and it’s finally beginning to feel like fall. Shonda Rhimes, the primetime network queen, has created one successful show after another without jeopardizing quality. Her characters are always complex and real, her narration is always personal and clever and her series as a whole are always worthy to binge. Setting aside other shows by Rhimes, I would like to focus on her edgiest and wittiest show to date, “How to Get Away with Murder.”“HTGAWM” has the signature fast pace of a Rhimes series. Beginning its third season, “HTGAWM” is still the new show on the block, considering that “Grey’s Anatomy” is on its 13th season. Yet, “HTGAWM” far surpasses “Grey’s Anatomy” in many aspects. “HTGAWM” tracks the high-adrenaline lives of law students at a prestigious Pennsylvania university after they are involved in a murder. The structure ditches the usual, one-case-per-episode format for something much more gripping—one serial plot point arched throughout a season. The series begins each season with the characters in an unbelievable situation revealed to us in a flash-forward, with most of the season unraveling to eventually get to that plot-point in time. For the season three premiere, the flash-forward is fully revealed at the end of the episode, filled with enough shock to promise a terrific new season.“HTGAWM” has one ingredient that pushes the series to the top spot of Shondaland originals: the wondrous acting capabilities of Viola Davis. As the misunderstood defense attorney and professor Annalise Keating, Davis channels a powerhouse performance unmatched by anything else on television. Her overqualified Emmy win for this role (which was the first win for an African-American woman in that category) cements her status as one of the best actresses to grace our screens. Professor Keating is a multifaceted, complicated character that Davis craftily harnesses with impeccable skill, pouring her talent into each episode.The third season premiere implies a developing maturation amongst the characters. Murder cover-ups that once forced an inseparable bond between Annalise and her student interns, “The Keating Five,” are deteriorating as Annalise’s morals are publicly questioned and the students no longer feel intimidated by her prowess. Ultimatums are no longer enforced between the corrupted lawyers and they are beyond ready to put the past behind them to move on. This ideal vanishes into smoke once this season’s flash-forward is revealed and their bond feels stronger than ever. “We’re good people now. Say it until you believe it,” Annalise utters in the season three premiere, a notion that is almost laughable at this point in the series.“HTGAWM” is a rare basic-cable series that still manages to thoughtfully push the boundaries in terms of race, sexuality, addiction, abuse and self-identity. The material seamlessly laces its dramatic plot with intricate characters that must face their personal battles alongside their legal ones, often at intersecting crossroads. The show effectively presents minority characters that are multi-dimensional. This quality is unfortunately only beginning to surface in the midst of our modern television climate. Shonda Rhimes is reputably on the forefront of this mission since her beginning with “Grey’s Anatomy.” Now “HTGAWM” continues this legacy with more quick wit and fun than ever before.Notice to readers: An after-publish edit has been made online, correcting a misspelling of Shonda Rhimes name in this week's first print issue.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/03/first-wave-line-breaks-festival-advocates-for-change-and-equality,"March 14, 2016 | 6:00am CDT","In many ways, advocacy and activism start with the arts. Countless individuals use their creative talents combined with personal experiences to bring attention to a wide array of political and social issues. Addressing concerns such as racial inequality, body shaming and gender stereotypes with a creative approach does two very important things. The first is that it makes the message easier to receive. For those who are pushing for unequal treatment or those who just don’t care enough to pay attention to the social issues, hearing the message in a creative manner could potentially cause them to pay more attention. It may not change their minds, but it opens a dialogue. The second is causing an emotional impact. There’s something unique about expressing oneself through poetry, music or a comedy skit. The words come alive when they are recited in front of an audience. Emotions are stronger than plain facts; that is why the arts are a perfect place to push for change.Bringing attention to these social and political problems through creative expression is exactly what First Wave is doing with their 10th annual Line Breaks Festival. A total of 10 different events took place in the Overture Center this past weekend. The organization is part of the UW Office of Multicultural Arts Initiative. As students at a university with a rich history of activism, First Wavers show how they can make a difference without relying on traditional forms of advocacy. With a combination of their three pillars—academics, arts and activism—they work to promote change for the better. Being the first program of its kind in the entire nation, First Wave has recruited students from all over the country, each with their own stories, passions and artistic abilities.Line Breaks Festival gives these students an opportunity to showcase their work in front of live audiences. The weekend-long events focused on prevalent social issues such as the Black Lives Matter movement and women empowerment, and even more personal topics like mental health, substance abuse and endless day-to-day struggles.A performance from First Wave’s 9th Cohort called “Unhe[a]rd: Radical Forms of Protest” showed how effective advocacy through the arts can be. While UW-Madison has a long history of activism, there is also a long history of hate. The first act of the festival was a continuous series of powerful statements fighting the hate of past and present. Signs saying “Ain’t no place safe these days,” “Cliteracy is a form of language,” “What is a hoe?” and “Black Lives Matter” were held by the performers and spread through the audience in complete silence and stillness. These signs would turn into important topics that were discussed in some way during the show. It forced the audience to sit and think about the words in front of them. Emotions played a major role in the show.Spoken word poems about living a life filled with oppression evoked some of the strongest reactions from the audience. First Wave’s strongest attribute is its ability to seamlessly combine the tragic experiences with a sort of entertainment. Though not the classic definition of entertainment, these performances stay with their audiences and are much more memorable than simply stating what is wrong with the world. With so many different topics covered in the show, the 9th Cohort graced the audience with a variety of performances. Whether rap, dance, poetry or even comedy skits, each type carried different feelings. The skits allowed for lighter moments in the show, while keeping the content relevant. College affordability, promotion of sexual independence, demolishing gender stereotypes and systematic racism were the main focus.A message constantly promoted was that one of the most impactful forms of protest is being yourself. There will always be people who disagree with your actions, but First Wave continues to push for individuality and equal rights for everyone who faces oppression.Eli Lynch’s show “Explosions” spoke on a more personal level. His combination of a live narrative, raps and a touch of theatrics told the story of life growing up while struggling with loss and reliance on substances. The one-on-one nature of the story helped narrow the scope for the audience. Many problems often seem too distant and complicated for anything to be done about them. In what seemed to be a disjointed set of stories of childhood, Eli stitched together a chilling narrative with a theatrical ending of him finding relief from prescription pills. Audience members gasped in shock from the ending of the show. The quick, abrupt ending illustrated how matters of personal struggle and abuse can end in devastating ways. The show seemed as if it were actually happening before our eyes, a testament to the emotional power of the arts.Line Breaks’ event schedule wasn’t strictly performing arts. Dasha Kelly, a poet and author, held a poetry writing workshop at the Madison Public Library. The workshop was not nearly as saturated with social commentary as the shows, but focused on the importance of writing and language. In one specific exercise, the people attending were asked to describe a force of nature such as wind or lava. After being asked several questions, Dasha instructed everyone to replace their force of nature with the word “Women”. The result was a set of beautiful poems about empowerment of women. Creative literature proved that it has an infinite potential for advocacy.First Wave’s Chapbook Series allows its scholars to get their poetry published. The personal stories from the six presenting poets covered a wide variety of topics just like the 9th Cohort’s show. From Ricardo Cortez de la Cruz II’s remixes of childhood fairytales that denounce the fetishization of black women, to Mariam Coker’s unique, broken-Arabic poem, the artists each had their own ways of addressing the national troubles that they feel most strongly about. Many people underestimate the power that different phrases can have.Without the arts and motivation of these insightful artists, many of these issues wouldn’t gain the mass attraction and appeal they need to be properly addressed. In an age containing what seems to be an endless flow of social unrest and political injustices, First Wave is taking huge steps in promoting change. Line Breaks is a prime example of how the arts can bring different groups together wishing to spread awareness for the social ailments this country holds. Traditional forms of activism still have a place in this world, but advocacy through the arts has proven to not only allow for the expansion and growth of creativity, but also reach audiences who respond more positively to emotional displays.",First Wave Line Breaks Festival advocates for change and equality,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/02/letter-to-the-editor-contraceptives-are-a-tool,"February 10, 2016 | 11:00am CST","Institutionalized religion has long had a history of predicting dire prophecies for the state of humanity if every choice and action of ours does not perfectly fall within its confines. Human beings are portrayed as the embodiment of purity that are corrupted by worldly sin and are hurtling fast towards an epic doom. Preserving that so-called purity of mind and body becomes a losing battle over time, one that humanity hangs on to by a very thin thread. Every new generation and decade then brings with it its own stench of depravity. While beliefs such as these may suffice for the masses of sheep and for the shepherd to keep them beautifully compliant, they’re in reality the well-crafted tool employed to curb human voice, freedom and choice.Last week the author of “The social impact of contraception” waxed poetry about Pope Paul VI’s encyclical, Humanae Vitae, and how the four predictions about the future of society made by the Pope in the instance of contraception being widely accepted have all “eerily come true.” I think the larger tragedy here is our penchant to blame the state of our world, society and relationships on anywhere else but where they actually belong, our own free actions.The first attack against contraception hails it as enabling marriage infidelity, which leads to higher rates of divorce and a general lowering of sexual morality. Human beings with all their superior intellect are brought down by tiny little pills and a few inches of a rubber sheathe. People should not cheat simply because the possible consequence of having an accidental child would be enough of a punishment to strike the fear of straying into them. But hand a man a condom and he is free to furiously copulate with any number of available orifices; betraying his partner in the process without a second thought. Morality here is being imposed by the weight of a “punishment,” not with what is right and what is wrong. And in the process, contraception is being labelled as the one herding the parade of sexual deviancy, unfaithfulness and divorce. Not people and not the choices they make with all their faculties.The increase in infidelity, abortions, venereal diseases and out-of-wedlock pregnancies can all be linked to the usage of contraception according to the author. All these things have been present since the dawn of time, modern science and contraception has simply made it a safer world for us to be unfaithful in if that happens to be one’s thing, make the decision to abort a pregnancy, curb the spread of STIs and have single parent pregnancies without the stamped approval of a marriage. The author and his Pope can debate the issue of morality all they want, but to call in question a scientific advancement that allows one to safely engage in sex and plan a family and then going as far as to blame humanity’s lack of morals on said advancement is an atrocious attack on the human intellect and freedom.The second attack blames contraception for the predominance of sexual objectification, pornography usage and/or addiction, and men viewing women as an “instrument of selfish enjoyment and no longer as his respected and beloved companion.” In addition to insulting both men and women, disregarding harmful societal norms that give rise to objectification of a gender and the psychology of pornography usage and/or addiction, this belief also blatantly ignores the fact that women have been viewed as a sexual object from all the way back to biblical times and are finally becoming somewhat equals to their counterparts in some parts of the world. I also fail to grasp how young children being exposed to pornography, which is an epidemic that needs to be dealt with, can be remotely linked to contraception. This also calls in question the author’s implication that sexual intimacy and satisfaction isn’t an important of a loving relationship. Citing statistics where divorces have either been a result of infidelity over the internet or a predilection towards porn may seem effective until you notice the lack of connection those numbers have with the usage of contraception. What I found most insulting though was the assertion that women can not use men as their instruments for selfish enjoyment just as much; something that apparently only the big bad cheating men are capable of.The author’s third attack on contraception as something that can be abused by those in power to affect mass sterilization, despite sounding like a conspiracy theory, was the only one I could see some merit in. The population of this planet has reached numbers where Earth cannot sustain the number of people living on it, without giving out at some point. In this instance, we might very well be heading towards an exploding point. While knowing that, my belief in human freedom still can not allow for mass sterilization as a solution without the consent of thousands and millions. But is contraception to be blamed for what those in power have the ability to do for the “greater good?"" Take away one weapon and they find another. If not render infertile, they’d bring disease. They’d bring famine or war. Put the blame on the shoulders of the men who make those decisions, not the tools that they abuse in carrying out said decisions.Referencing China’s one child policy was also a misplaced concern in the battle against contraception. In order to protect the billions and ensure the existence of resources for them, the Chinese government passed a law which made sense in the time they passed it for their country. It may also curb human freedom, but it does so legally and with justifiable reasons. The ramifications of that law is now felt by that government, something they’ll have to work towards reversing now. But a nation’s reach to pass laws for their citizens for the greater good of the ones that are living can not be blamed on contraception.The final attack on contraception is actually one on science and the power of human intelligence instead as it hails man’s apparently mistaken belief of having dominion over his own body. Sterilization, euthanasia, and test tube babies are blamed on contraception and our insatiable desire to bend our bodies to our will rather than bending our will to our bodies. The three issues mentioned above are so wildly controversial with a wealth of reasons that can be contained within them, that simply blaming them on contraception is false and a disservice to their gravity. What they do have in common though is the full exercising of human freedom, one that every human being has over their own body, and I believe as long as that freedom does no harm to anyone else or incorporate deviancy it has no justifiable reason to be curbed by anyone. Never should the exercising of that freedom be deemed immoral or paraded as proof for the corruption of mankind.“It is impossible to ignore the devastating impact it (contraception) has had on our families, our relationships and our society,” is how the author chose to end his article, failing to see that human beings do not become more corrupt over time. We were not born pure or innocent, we were born flawed and human. And that is how we shall be till the very end of our days. What we do in our lives – the mistakes, scientific advancements, immoral acts, deviant behavior, employment of equality and freedom – is on us, our choices and our actions. It can not be blamed on modes, methods or tools and neither can ones created scientifically to advance humanity be painted villainously as something that corrupts us. Contraception, the scientific tool that allows us to be safe from diseases, engage sexually in the entanglement of our choice, and plan a family smartly has advanced human freedom in insurmountable ways. Its impact, far from devastating, will forever be known as one of mankind’s most intelligent moments.This article was written in response to Ben Miller's article ""The social impact of contraception.""

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2016/02/the-social-impact-of-contraception,"February 2, 2016 | 11:00am CST","In 1968, Pope Paul VI sat down to write what would become one of the biggest influences in contemporary Catholic moral teaching. Facing major societal pressure as a result of the ""sexual revolution,"" many thought Pope Paul was going to lift the Church’s ban on contraception. However, when the ink had dried, the hands and mind of Pope Paul had written the most elegant and prophetic secular defense and reaffirmation of the Church’s doctrine on contraceptives.Forty-eight years later, the words of Pope Paul VI remain as a beautiful yet concerning prophecy of the state of a society that has fully accepted the use of contraception, a society that we now live in today. As such, I would like to examine his secular argument and assess its validity in today’s society.Humanae Vitae is the name of Pope Paul’s famous encyclical that makes four predictions about the future of society if it were to adopt a widespread acceptance of the use of contraception. Sadly, I believe each of these predictions has eerily come true, proving what happens when a large portion of society embraces the varying methods of birth control.First, the Pope predicted that widespread use of contraceptives would “lead to conjugal [or marriage] infidelity and the general lowering of morality.” According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States had a divorce rate of 33 percent in 1970, a historically high rate at the time. By 2010, the divorce rate was looming around 50 percent, and based on research by Buss and Shackelford, an estimated 30 to 60 percent of all married individuals will engage in infidelity at some point in their marriage. Whether on the high or low end of this statistic, that’s a massive percentage. Many of us have been either directly affected or have seen the effects of this decline in marriage fidelity. Not only do the statistics show its massive increase, it is an issue that has become self-evident to many people. That is not to forget the massive increase in abortions, out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and venereal diseases that have rained down on our society. It is without a doubt that sexual morality has decreased since the writing of Humanae Vitae.Second, Pope Paul foresaw that men would come to “the point of considering [a woman] as a mere instrument of selfish enjoyment and no longer as his respected and beloved companion.” Again, this has become an issue that appears as self-evident to many people. As I wrote in my article last week, the sexual objectification is a serious issue that has plagued our society. Pornography statistics research group Covenant Eyes has found nine out of 10 boys are now exposed to pornography by the age of 18. Also, 68 percent of divorce cases involved one party meeting a new lover over the Internet, and 56 percent of divorce cases involved one party having an obsessive interest in pornographic websites. Our society has started to focus on sexual gratification as the most important part of love, and relationships have universally suffered as a result. Many men have now gotten to this point of objectification as Paul VI predicted.Third, Pope Paul wrote contraception would be a “dangerous weapon... in the hands of those public authorities who take no heed of moral exigencies.” This is an issue less obvious to some, but still horribly serious. The Kenya Catholic Doctors Associated tested six samples of a tetanus shot distributed by UNICEF and WHO in poor countries. The samples tested positive for the HCG antigen which is widely used in anti-fertility vaccines. Even worse, this is not the first time these organizations have been accused of mass sterilization in poor countries. In 2013, UNICEF purchased 1.7 million polio vaccines for use in Syria in which there hadn’t been a case of polio since 1999. As a result, many unknowing victims have become infertile. Let us also not forget China’s one-child policy which had to be lifted due to the resulting underpopulation problems. This authoritative abuse of contraceptives has destroyed the potential for new life. Once again, Pope Paul was right almost five decades in advance.Fourth, the Pope thought that acceptance of contraception would lead to man believing he has unlimited dominion over his own body. The Guttmacher Institute found that sterilization, both male and female, has become the most commonly used contraceptive method. Furthermore, the increase in euthanasia and the creation of “test-tube babies” has proven man’s desire to have unlimited control over his own body, rather than adjusting ourselves to our bodily needs we try to adjust our body to our desires.Finally, Pope Paul VI made a fifth prediction in that he believed men and women would struggle to practice the methods of family planning that require periodic abstinence. It takes great amounts of self-discipline. However, he taught that this discipline was possible. As we see today, many do struggle to overcome this lack of discipline. At the same time, those who have set their mind to it have been successful. It is possible to overcome, and more importantly avoid the aforementioned negative societal effects.In the near five decades since the publication of Humanae Vitae, our society has undergone a major change as a result of the use of contraception. As the statistics show, what Pope Paul VI had predicted is now coming to fruition. I myself find his secular argument against contraception to be enlightening, valid and truthful. At the same time, it is concerning to know society at large is heading the opposite direction and driving us deeper into these predictions he made. Whether one chooses to accept contraception or not, it is impossible to ignore the devastating impact it has had on our families, our relationships and our society.Ben is a freshman majoring in political science.

Scott Walker launched his 2018 re-election campaign at an event in Waukesha, immigrant rights advocates protested just outside, demanding the governor publicly oppose a controversial immigration bill.Senate Bill 275, which was voted through committee last Thursday, would bar municipalities from prohibiting law enforcement from inquiring about individuals’ immigration status, or refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.It would also empower certain officials to proceed with enforcement action against undocumented individuals.A similar proposal failed in the legislature last year, following a daylong general strike by immigrant-workers and protests by advocate groups and allies.Voces de la Frontera, one of such groups, has announced preparations to do so again, according to Executive Director Christine Neumann-Ortiz.“We’re demanding that [Walker] publicly speak out and veto this bill,” said Neumann-Ortiz, who has announced her organization’s intent to build support for another, more-sustained general strike. “We want him to say that he will stand by the contributions that immigrant families make to our economy.”Proponents of the bill, like the Federation for American Immigration Reform, feel that the proposed reforms are necessary for public safety, citing fears about criminal activity in immigrant communities.“Shielding criminal aliens needlessly endangers innocent lives. There are roughly 3 million criminal aliens living in the United States, and nearly 1 million of these aliens have final orders of removal,” Susan Tully, F.A.I.R’s field director, told the Committee on Labor and Regulatory Reform. “These criminals should not be able to continue to live in communities and engage in further criminal activity.However, opponents of the legislation fear that tying immigration enforcement to local authorities could damage trust and cooperation between law enforcement and undocumented communities.“[This bill] turns our government and local institutions into an arm of immigration, making people afraid to report cases of domestic abuse, trafficking, or sexual abuse,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “They’re afraid to contact or work with law enforcement, making people more vulnerable.”The proposal, introduced by state Sen. Stephen Nass, R-Whitewater, is expected to be taken up on the floor of the Senate in the coming months.",Walker urged to oppose controversial immigration bill as he embarks on re-election bid,UWM

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/10/marilyn-mansons-new-album-invokes-previous-work-yet-lacks-maturity,"October 11, 2017 | 7:00am CDT","Marilyn Manson rings in his 10th studio album, Heaven Upside Down, with all of the showmanship, attention grabbing theatrics and occasional nihilistic ballads those familiar with Manson's past work can come to expect from the self-proclaimed “Antichrist Superstar.”For those unfamiliar with Manson's work, his music is considered Nu-Metal — a subgenre of metal alt rock. Manson once kept ‘90s suburban moms up at night in fear of the next desecrating act he would commit. Infamously embracing, rather than shying away from, the public eye, Manson, also known as Brian Hugh Warner, has capitalized on his publicity by being transparent about his sexual promiscuity, rampant substance abuse and iconic fashion sense.Manson shook the rock industry to its bedrock with the release of his dark industrial trio of albums — Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood — which is regarded as his defining work. Throughout his peak, Manson was as big of a mainstream antihero as the artist he would later go on to inspire, Lil Uzi Vert.Two years ago, Manson released the Greek mythos fixated album, The Pale Emperor, that took a more sophisticated version of his music style and paired it with depressive self-reflection. In Heaven Upside Down, Manson manages to backtrack into more familiar and immature territory that steps above anything we have heard from the artist since 2003.Regardless of being a fan of Manson's style or character, it's difficult to deny the high level of production that went into his latest album. Even more impressive is the similarities between specific tracks' compositions and his prior songs — even though these adjustments are not always improvements.Tracks like ""SAY10"" and ""Revelation #12"" compare well to older tracks like ""The Fight Song"" and ""Disposable Teens."" The bruiting force of these tracks takes what made their angry, faster-paced predecessors and measures them out into a more sluggish rendition that comes close to reaching the greatness of the songs they mimic. The track ""Kill4me,"" for example, sounds like it was recorded the same day as the 2007 pop-oriented ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"" that comes off as more stylized and fitting of Mason's discography.Adversely, ""Tattooed in Reverse"" features an infectious and more rampant guitar riff similar to the one found in the genre-defining track ""Sweet Dreams,"" which is one of my favorites on the album. I touched on the step backwards in maturity on this album, and ""JE$U$ CRI$I$"" — with lyrics like ""I write songs to fight and to f*ck to"" — encapsulate this point to an almost eye-rolling degree. Manson still finds a lot of power on religious defamation to the point where it becomes a bit of a crutch that suggests he is more of a provocateur than a poet.The magnum opus of this album arrives at its halfway point with the eight-minute long ""Saturnalia."" The swamp-like bubbling of the electronic undertones in this track alongside the tempered yet melodic percussion, coupled with the siren-esque wails of guitars, all wonderfully collide with Mason's vocals like some kind of tranquil bulletstorm.For better or worse, Manson's notoriety and mastery over controversy has enabled him to continue creating music while retaining the coverage needed for fueling the rockstar’s vices. Those looking to rediscover some solid rock or trying to expand their spectrum of music should listen to Heaven Upside Down with a grain of salt.Grade: B-",Marilyn Manson’s new album invokes previous work yet lacks maturity,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/06/state-representatives-attempt-to-curb-teen-dating-violence-with-bipartisan-bill,"June 23, 2017 | 12:57pm CDT","The problem of teen dating violence has garnered attention across the country in recent years as surveys have shown its increased prevalence among high school students. Now, Wisconsin state representatives from both sides of the aisle have introduced a bill aimed at addressing the phenomenon.Teen dating violence is defined by the Centers for Disease Control as “physical, sexual, psychological, or emotional violence within a dating relationship.” The legislation, introduced Thursday by Reps. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, Melissa Sargent, D-Madison and John Spiros, R-Marshfield, attempts to curb this problem by “creat[ing] teen dating violence curriculum in schools across Wisconsin,” according to a press release from Sargent’s office.The bill would require school boards to explicitly prohibit teen dating violence at school events, train school district employees to identify and respond to instances of teen dating violence and instruct middle and high schools students about appropriate behavior in relationships.“Students often feel something isn’t right about the way they’re being treated, but they’re not sure what to call it, and they don’t know enough about relationships yet to know what they’re experiencing isn’t healthy or right,” Sargent said in the release.Sargent called teen dating violence “an absolutely pervasive problem,” and data supports that notion. A 2013 survey showed that 1 in 5 female students and 1 in 10 male students experience sexual and/or physical dating violence, which does not include potential emotional or psychological abuse.End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin, a group that advocates for survivors of domestic abuse, immediately heralded the bill.“One in three teens in the US is a victim of physical, emotional or verbal abuse from a dating partner, a rate that is higher than all other forms of youth violence,” Patti Seger, executive director of the organization, said. “End Abuse is thrilled to see the Wisconsin legislature take steps to address this problem.”The lead authors of the bill, Kleefisch and Sargent, are on starkly opposite ends of the political spectrum—Democrats frequently rebuke Kleefisch, who has been a vocal proponent of drug-testing welfare recipients and decreasing access to abortion, while Sargent is seen as one of the most liberal members of the Legislature. But Sargent said a bill to address teen dating violence is one that both Democrats and Republicans can get behind.“We need to educate students on what healthy relationships are and teach them how to identify abuse when they see it, and that’s what this bill does,” Sargent said. “We look forward to this bill receiving earnest, bipartisan support this session.” ",State representatives attempt to curb teen dating violence with bipartisan bill,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2017/01/radical-goodness,"January 25, 2017 | 9:06pm CST","Imagine a world where characteristics that make us “different” are invisible. Race, gender, sexual orientation and religion are all inconceivable. Instead, what one sees in another is pure equality.Under such a society, recognition of privilege and circumstance still exists. However, while people realize they’re better or worse off than another individual, they also realize that they are the same.Since factors that have come to separate people in modern society do not exist in this one, all that remains is the recognition that others need help and you have the means to provide it. Let’s call this radical goodness; the idea that people should support people, period.If this mindset is adopted, where would the globe’s problems stand? If not diminished, they would be at least reevaluated. Imagine a global society where differences resulting in war and mass destruction, discrimination and hatred, were all minimized under the simple idea that we are alike as a species, but unalike in quality of life and have the means to right the unequally weighted ship.Understandably, this is no simple gospel to preach or take hold of. Categorization and separation have always defined societies and it is hard to forget that many have received such discrimination. Furthermore, there are certain things earned that have become socially acceptable to feel entitled to. Both these obstacles are deeply engrained in our social construct. The adoption of radical goodness would supersede such petty excuses for accepted underrepresentation, hatred and discrimination.Let’s run through a hypothetical situation. You’re strolling down a city street when a struggling individual approaches and asks kindly for financial support.Whether you decline or accept is an entirely different matter altogether, what matters is the recognition that the individual needed help, an instance where radical goodness would take the reigns without fail. Regardless the amount of the donation, the gesture brightens not only the individual but also those observing the generosity.This, of course, does not only apply to financial support. Imagine a global society where those with discriminatory views saw every person as an equal. Imagine the sustainable and progressive society that would emerge.From charitability to hospitality to expressive kindness, radical goodness has no drawbacks if universally accepted. Even if it were adopted and people took advantage of its vulnerability, radical goodness has the power to ultimately influence those who abuse goodness to reevaluate their values through goodness. Hate and division is never progressive. While anger may feel warranted, it is simply impractical and harmful.In a snapshot of history where divisive ideology has dominated, radical goodness is the obvious key and when looked at through a purely conceptual and definition oriented lense, the benefits are all encompassing. Racism? Sexism? Homophobia? Xenophobia? Transphobia? Radical goodness renders all obsolete. Furthermore, radical goodness should not be a radicalized notion for when the aspects meant to differentiate us are removed from the mind’s eye, all that remains is the recognition that we are the same but unequally privileged. That recognition is the simple answer to unlocking the potential for a self-sustaining kindness machine.As a white, straight, cisgendered male, I can’t relate to the lives of those with different characteristics than my own and therefore cannot preach a way of life that hinges on the necessity to put aside differences even if you’ve been on the receiving end of discrimination.Instead, I present the idea as a building block for a reevaluation of how we treat one another day in and day out and hope it manifests itself in reflection.Perhaps poet Maya Angelou said it most simply, “I’ve sailed upon the seven seas and stopped in every land, I’ve seen the wonders of the world not yet one common man … I note the obvious differences between each sort and type, but we are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike. We are more alike, my friends, than we are unalike.”Lucas is a freshman studying Journalism. What are your thoughts on radical goodness?

We are against borders.”In 2009, the U.S. supported a coup that destabilized Honduras, resulting in high rates of femicide and the murdering of transgender individuals.This led to families being tear-gassed along the California border while U.S. agents maintained crowd control by firing weapons at them. The warfare of tear gas is banned in nearly every country, notably the U.S.“Though it’s coming from outside the U.S., the causes of this migration are very much from here,” Scheevel said.U.S. policy continues to blame Honduran refugees, but in reality, they are the victims, noted Sari Hattis, co-chair of the Young Democratic Socialists of America.“The U.S. has long played an oppressive role in Honduran politics that has led to this refugee crisis,” Hattis said. “The blood is on our hands.”Plumes of heated breaths from about 50 protesters linked messages of immigrant supporters as they shouted, “Say it loud! Say it clear! Immigrants are welcomed here!”In lieu of the rejection of support for immigrants at the Mexican border from the government, the sound of stomping feet and echoed chants filled the heart of Madison.On a sunny day in June, individuals demanded 2,300 immigrant children would reunite with their families. Amounting to over 1,000 people, the protest placed a spotlight on the familial separation in between shouts of “Abolish ICE.”“The right to seek asylum is actually protected by both U.S. and International law,” Hattis said. “The closing of the border would only be legal if they knew the migrants would be safe, which we know is not the case.”UW-Madison third-year law student Charris Zimmick recounted three different tales of women who were detained in federal detention after crossing the border in Dilley, Texas. These women faced abuse, sexual violence and death threats resulting in the decision to flee.Retellings of the brutal realities were designed to lift up their stories and recognize the trauma that the individuals and families are struggling to escape.Refugees that choose to leave for the “American Dream” are also viewed as economic migrants by Republicans. This is the fallacy of immigration, according to Zimmick.“None of these women ever spoke to me of the ‘American Dream.’ They are not trying to gain the system, they are not criminals, they are not violent,” Zimmick said. “These individuals and families are strong, incredible and resilient survivors of horrific violence and trauma. And I hope that we think of them that way. Not simply as people to be pitied, or worse, to fear.”",Migrant caravan violence leads call to arms throughout Madison community,UWM

These barriers include racism and discrimination, language barriers, blackmailing, immigration status as coercion and the fear of deportation.Vargas said you can learn about the experiences of undocumented immigrants and give them resources as well as believe and respect them in order to help.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/10/rupi-kaurs-the-sun-and-her-flowers-is-a-recipe-for-life,"October 1, 2018 | 8:00am CDT","In light of Rupi Kaur’s appearance at UW-Madison, I thought this was the perfect time to explore her newest collection, “the sun and her flowers.” An opportunity to dive into the world of poetry was not going to be passed up.Her debut collection “milk and honey” liberated poetry from the archaism of convoluted subjects and strict meter. The fluidity of her style transforms the metaphors that encapsulate the struggle of life.After self-publishing “milk and honey,” Kaur signed a two-book deal with publishing company Simon and Schuster. The long-awaited pseudo-sequel came Oct. 3, 2017. It is designed to be a more grown-up version that dives deeper into the complexity of human emotion.“the sun and her flowers” touches on the various forms of love: “A vibrant and transcendent journey about growth and healing. Ancestry and honoring one’s roots. Expatriation and rising up to find a home within yourself.”The themes center around love and loss, trauma and abuse, healing, femininity and the body. Certain topics of female infanticide, immigration and borders bring about the realization for Kaur’s mission: equality and love for all genders, races and backgrounds.The origination for this titular collection arose from Kaur’s thought process on a difficult breakup. She disclosed, “We are all our own suns and flowers are the experiences and the people we got through in our entire lifetime, so the sun and her flowers.”The stylization is similar to “milk and honey” by reflection of Kaur’s culture. This is done through the inclusion of Gurmukhi script, the use of only lower-case letters. She purposefully abstains from traditional punctuation to powerfully affirm each line.There are a combination of short poems with longer narratives when recounting issues such as her parents’ broken English and its beauty or self-reclamation after sexual abuse. Her poems often lack titles and distinct boundaries between each piece; they can either be read as sequences or individually. The fluidity is an organic creation of poetry that is distinct from the formal constraints of the genre.Originally, “the sun and her flowers” was intended to be a collection detailing the intricacies of unhealthy relationships and how toxic love distorts our view of the world. Due to the recent climate, Kaur was pulled to write about the political implications of diaspora and immigration. There is an evident shift from the repetition of love poems and healing shown in “milk and honey” to a distressed commentary on racial issues.The book is split into five sections, designed to reflect the life cycle of flowers: “wilting,” “falling,” “rooting,” “rising” and “blooming.” Each section focuses on one thematic aspect that overarches the main message: a celebration of love in all its forms. Similar to the last collection, there are sketches and illustrations that are relevant to each flower cycle.The first section, “wilting,” touches on the pervading distress of lost love and the struggle of waking up in bed alone. This is not simply lamentation of a breakup, but the affirmation of needing self-love. It demonstrates the early stages of a breakup and people getting in touch with their new selves.In the poem “what love looks like,” she questions the definition of love and our unhealthy obsession with solely romantic affection. This is not a pitiful sob story but rather a candid expression of what it should be like. She writes, “i think love starts here/ everything else is just desire and projection.” Love is an act of giving: the love of selflessly hard-working parents or the fading love of a distant friend.The arduous journey toward self-acceptance is not simplified or watered down, and the struggles of depression are disturbingly depicted. For example, “what draws you to her/ tell me what you like/ so I can practice” exposes a self-flagellating psyche. However, it’s crucial to note there is a defiant refusal to find validation in a lover’s approval.The next section, “falling,” is the downfall of the first part with the overwhelming emotions of loneliness and sorrow. The focus is around the depressive feelings after a loss of an important relationship — that dark cloud which feels heavy.The poem “depression is a shadow living in me” shows the evocation of dejection and utter hopelessness. It demonstrates the vivid imagery of a person trapped within their own thoughts.“rooting” is the third section and shows a shift in its exploration of topics like female infanticide and immigration. This is the process of regaining strength and self-worth in life. The contemplation of life at its fullest and rumination. The soul is able to re-energize and begin again.Rather than homogenize these experiences into collective trauma, Kaur focuses on the intimate moments of her mother’s longing for her native Punjab. This nuanced exploration of faces is shown through her guilt about her parents’ sacrifices and the desire to understand their cultural history, to have “pried their silence apart like a closed envelope.” This is not just grief, but a fierce pride of racial identity: “it is a blessing/ to be the colour of the earth.”There is a demand for more representation in literature which is emphasized by her unapologetic poetic style that takes up space: “to be mouthy/ get as loud as we need/ to be heard.”The fourth cycle is entitled “rising.” This is the transition into a more positive note after the sensation of being at rock bottom. It’s taking action and ascending from the lowest level. She notes this in the section’s first poem, “on the first day of love/ you wrapped me in the word special.” There is still love out there.Kaur’s poem “celebration” illustrates nature’s creatures struggling through the blossoming process. There is an expression of hesitation to continue their lives. This hesitation connects with every person who has at one time in their life refused to turn the page and move on. In order to grow, people must leave behind the toxicity.The collection ends on a note of pure hopefulness in “blooming.” This is the moment when the flower reaches full form and is able to stand alone. You are able to realize that you do not need another person to be whole anymore. There is a recognition of self-worth and a lesson to love what matters most: yourself.Her first poem reads: “the universe took its time on you/ crafted you to offer the world/ something different from everyone else/ when you doubt/ how you were created/ you doubt an energy greater than us both — irreplaceable.” That last word truly resonates with you, because it is crucial to go through each cycle to get to where you are now. The blooming is the epitome of why you are here. You are worth it.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/08/your-primer-for-tuesdays-statewide-primaries,"August 13, 2018 | 9:13am CDT","In one of the most anticipated primary elections in recent years, Wisconsinites will head to the polls Tuesday to select their party’s nominees for a swath of key races coming in the general election.Seen as a major battleground in what will likely be a decisive midterm election, the state’s voters will decide who will make the ballot for governor, U.S. Senate and lieutenant governor, as well as several district-based legislative races, both state and federal.Democratic primary for governorPerhaps the most high-profile of them all is the contentious battle to decide which Democrat will face sitting Gov. Scott Walker.With a level of name recognition and financial backing none of his opponents could hope to rival, Walker’s run for a third term may actually be his toughest yet.The governor has always been a divisive figure in the state, but some recent polls show he might be more vulnerable than in the past.Recent polls from Emerson College and Marist show Walker losing to current Democratic frontrunner and state superintendent Tony Evers, while pollsters at Wisconsin’s own Marquette University give Walker the edge.“The Republicans have made gains in Wisconsin,” said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. “But it may be difficult for the GOP to make a convincing case in 2018.”Far and away the most well known candidate in the race thanks to years in statewide office, 31 percent of respondents in the Marquette poll prefered Evers, while no other candidate managed to reach double digits.Relatively united on policy issues, like bolstering healthcare, education and infrastructure spending, other Democrats have struggled to make themselves known to the public, while Evers has used his background in education to make his case.“As a member of the Board of Regents, Tony has seen firsthand the damage Scott Walker has inflicted on higher education in Wisconsin,” Maggie Gau, Evers’ campaign manager, told the Daily Cardinal. “He’s cut more from our UW System than almost any other governor in the country. When other states began reinvesting in higher education, Wisconsin chose not to and it’s resulted in fewer classes and quality educators for our kids.”Of Evers’ seven opponents, former state Rep. Kelda Roys, state firefighters’ union head Mahlon Mitchell and former party chairman Matt Flynn are seen as the most viable competitors.Roys, the former director of NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin, is backed by women’s groups including Emily’s List and has been a successful fundraiser.“Kelda Roys is entering the final stretch of this campaign with the resources, message, and momentum needed to win,” Roys campaign spokesperson Brian Evans said in a statement. “If Democrats want a candidate who can take on and take down Scott Walker, they must vote for Kelda Roys.”Mitchell, age 41, is seen by some as another young, exciting alternative along with 39-year-old Roys.With the backing of many of the state’s labor organizations, some see Mitchell as the candidate to challenge Walker on the effects of his 2011 Act 10 law, which disempowered most unions from collectively bargaining for wages and benefits.Flynn has proven to be a divisive candidate — despite a strong foundation of support within the party, he has received significant backlash for his role as a lawyer for the Milwaukee Archdiocese during a major child sexual abuse scandal.The other candidates, who many see as lacking the resources and support to make a run for the nomination, include progressive activist Mike McCabe, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, D-Alma, as well as lawyer and political newcomer Josh Pade.Republican primary for SenateAs national Republicans hope to expand their slim, single vote majority in the U.S. Senate, the party has their eyes on incumbent Democrats up for reelection in states won by President Donald Trump.Near the top of many Republicans list is U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has had more money spent against her than any other Democratic incumbent.The state party has backed state Sen. Leah Vukmir, who has garnered big name endorsements from the likes of House Speaker Paul Ryan, former national party chairman Reince Priebus and even hired Gov. Scott Walker’s son, Alex, as an aide.The problem? Vukmir still may not win.The Brookfield Republican is neck and neck with Kevin Nicholson, a marine veteran and businessman, who has been able to court some influential conservative donors into financing his primary stint.Richard Uihlein, an Illinois businessman and Republican megadonor, has already dropped nearly $8 million in contributions and ads to either support Nicholson or oppose Vukmir.Both have not been without controversy, however, as Vukmir has faced backlash for calling Trump, who remains extremely popular among the Republican rank-and-file, “offensive to everyone” in 2016. She later walked back that claim and affirmed support for her party’s president in an ad.Nicholson, a former registered Democrat, faced criticism from Republicans for his former ties to their opponents, but said he drifted from the party long ago.Both candidates heavily praised the president in their last primary debate; Nicholson said Trump has done “good work, and we should applaud him for it,” while Vukmir declared he is “standing for our country,""While the two Republicans remain in a dead heat, Baldwin has held a strong lead against both in the polls, defeating Vukmir by 17 points and Nicholson by 15 points.Republicans hope that with the primary will come the unity needed to flip the state’s key senate seat.Democratic primary for lieutenant governorAlong with Gov. Scott Walker, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch is running unopposed in the Republican primary, and will be up for reelection as a part of the party’s gubernatorial ticket.On the other side, two Democrats are duking it out to pair up with whoever comes out on top of their party’s primary for governor.Mandela Barnes, a former state legislator, has emphasized outlining a progressive legislative agenda as the key to inspiring voters in November.""We have to stand up and run for something,"" Barnes said in his speech at the Democratic Convention in Oshkosh. ""We have to talk about who we are as Democrats. We have to talk about our plan to expand opportunity across this entire state.""Barnes, a 31-year-old from Milwaukee, lost a 2016 primary bid for state Senate to current state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee.His opponent is Kurt Kober, a Sheboygan businessman who recently moved back to Wisconsin after a decade of living out of state.Kober, like many Democrats, sees undoing Walker’s impact on the state as central to any party agenda.""Imagine if we supported public education. Imagine if we supported a spirit of entrepreneurship in our state. Imagine if we once again embraced the Wisconsin Idea,” he said.With control of Congress and a series of key state policy battles hanging in the balance, Wisconsin’s primary elections will set up more than a few races to watch in November.",Your primer for Tuesday’s statewide primaries,UWM

For UW-Madison freshman Angela Adams, the faults of her freshman year were not faults of her own, but rather of the famous tequila brand Jose Cuervo and Buzzfeed’s irresistible “Which Type Of Avocado Are You?” quizzes. When asked about her misfortune, Adams immediately broke down. It was not until after we coaxed her out of her misery with overpriced coffee and ridiculous amounts of praise for her courage that she agreed to comment.  “I just can’t believe that I let these capitalist sharks take advantage of me. I did not consent to this form of forced manipulation. I will never be able to recover from this. Tequila and social media quizzes ruined my life,” she choked as she held back tears.Adams decided to sue these major companies after, as she claims, they made her fail her Communication Arts 100 and Human Sexuality courses. While these are typically considered the easiest courses on campus, the presence of substances that guarantee abuse and the temptation of headlines such as “We Know When You’ll Get Engaged Based on Your Chipotle Order” or “Tell Us Your Desert Preferences And We’ll Tell You How Many Time You Will Have Sex This Week”. Adams’s parents, both influential lawyers, have assured us that this case will be won and college students everywhere won’t have to face such daunting decisions between attending class or getting blacked out on a Tuesday afternoon ever again. “We believe that it is feasible to completely shut down these corporations. Burnett’s, Natural Light and Netflix are next,” Adams’s lawyer and father said outside of the courthouse Tuesday afternoon. “Millennials will not be able to become successful for as long as these predators are profiting and left untouched.” While we are unsure of how Angela will heal, we only hope that through her advocacy, strategic placement of highly informative posters and these legal proceedings will ensure that this does not happen to another UW freshman again.","Freshman sues Jose Cuervo and Buzzfeed for ruining her GPA, rich lawyer parents likely to win case",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/03/high-schoolers-impress-in-the-risky-spring-awakening,"March 5, 2018 | 7:30am CST","Express Yourself! put on its final production of “Spring Awakening” on Saturday night at the Bartell Theater after performing around Wisconsin since the beginning of November.“Spring Awakening” is a rock musical based on Frank Wedekind’s late 19th-century play of the same name — it proves that teen angst knows no time period. The musical was conceived in the 90s and hit Broadway in 2006 where it won eight Tony Awards, but more importantly, shone a red-hot, sexually-charged spotlight on the previously pristine Broadway stage.The show’s classical German attire clashes beautifully with the musical’s intense content including suicide, parental abuse, abortion and more, making the performance by Express Yourself!’s mostly high school-aged cast all the more impressive. There were moments so sweet I audibly whimpered and times I realized I was tensing my muscles and holding my breath.The musical opens with Wendla Bergmann (Isabel Garlough-Shah) grappling with the emotions of her burgeoning sexuality, finding no help from her mother despite her pleads to learn where babies come from. Wendla’s frustration finds company with the other young women in town, which they voice in the song “Mama Who Bore Me (Reprise).” Enter Melchoir Gabor (Zachariah Sterner), a well-read radical fed up with the intellectual confines his professor puts on him and his classmates — including Wendla’s personal, yet problematic sexual awakening.The simple staging allowed each scene to exist in its purest form without the distraction of an elaborate set. The ever-present symbol of a leafy tree cast in light against the black curtain contextualized quieter, less intense scenes and faded to the background during chaotic moments.The dynamic between the adults and teens in the town follows a Charlie Brown-like structure: the adults were played by the same three actors, spouting uninspired messages of shame and disappointment at the youth, while the teens vocalize their inner turmoil to heavy guitar beats. Fueled by anxiety and most afflicted by the adult shaming, Moritz Stiefel (played by understudy Austin Brummett) makes a confidant out of Melchoir when he tells him about the womanly legs that visit him in his dreams each night to his horror. This is seconded only by his fear of academic failure. Melchoir promises to divulge his sexual expertise to Moritz in essay form — with pictures, though.Traditional gender roles are perhaps the only social boundaries the musical doesn’t push: the male characters lament over their sexual frustrations and the female characters fantasize about which boy in town might be their someday-hubby.Director Jenna Carol made the risky choice to cast the actors as close to their character’s ages as possible in order to give them more relatability. “Wise beyond their years” doesn’t begin to cover the maturity the cast approached the show with. Their voices paled slightly during quieter melodies, but their group harmonies and beltier moments raised both energy and goosebumps.The whole show is steeped in angst, but the act two number “Totally Fucked” was a peak both musically and emotionally. During this number, the whole cast passionately belted expletives prompting cheers from the audience. The song is an eruptive moment of pure pubescence in what is otherwise an unbelievably mature script. As an audience member, it’s tempting to join the cast in singing the flippant mockery of the adults with the perfectly teenaged lyrics: “blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.”The weight of shame grows heavier and heavier on the teens’ shoulders in act two with ultimately dire consequences for three of the main characters.The show left me with a lot to ponder about the pressure adults burden teenagers with, but it mainly serves as a cautionary tale for the lack of communication and abundance of shame society —both modern and late nineteenth century Germany — places on teenagers. From start to finish, the kids contend with the shame of failing in school, having sex outside of marriage (and liking it), masturbating, experiencing abuse and the shame of homosexuality, just to name a few. After having a horrifying realization of the reality of her situation, Wendla agonizes to her mama, “My God, why didn’t you tell me everything?”Following the cast’s immensely mature performances, they melted back into their teenage selves with gripping hugs and fat tears streaming down their faces. Watching this family-like cast share their last performance of a play unlike any other they’ll likely perform in as teens rivaled the emotional punch of a well done coming-of-age movie.In a phone interview, lead Isa Garlough-Shah, who portrayed Wendla, said being part of this production was unlike any other she’s ever acted in. It required intense trust-building among the cast, especially between herself and her partner Zachariah Sterner.Although the content of Spring Awakening feels anything but safe or comfortable, after the bows Director Jenna Carol said this production was a safe space for the actors at a time when it’s hard to say the same about their high schools.",High schoolers impress in the risky ‘Spring Awakening’,UWM

The report shows evidence that a guard was choked by one of the inmates, who is now facing charges for the incident, and other guards sustained knee, shoulder and nose injuries. At one point, five inmates climbed into the ceiling area and broke lights. Lincoln Hills has experienced continued controversy over multiple allegations of physical and sexual abuse, resulting in lawsuits from inmates to the facility’s officers and administration. Gov. Tony Evers’ administration passed a law requiring the closure of Lincoln Hills by 2021. Teresa Abreu, a court-ordered monitor who regularly visits Lincoln Hills, went to the facility about a week before the incident unfolded, noting the conditions were improving. ""Youth attitudes overall were very good during this site visit. As a result of the progress made, it is clearly evident that these changes are having a positive impact on the overall atmosphere and culture of the facility,"" Abreu claimed.In the past month, due to court mandated changes, Lincoln Hills has seen increased staff from adult prisons all over the state to support the facilities’ needs. Additional changes include the punishment procedures, which no longer allow inmates to be placed into solitary confinement for extended periods of time.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/11/we-asked-uw-students-what-does-this-election-mean-to-you,"November 5, 2020 | 1:00am CST","Four years ago, before most UW-Madison students were even able to vote, an election fundamentally changed the way our generation views politics. On Tuesday, many of those students cast their first ballots in a contest where they saw a stark difference between two incompatible versions of America. The Daily Cardinal took to the streets to find out what specific issues make this election meaningful for students here at UW-Madison. After battleground swing state of Wisconsin fell red in 2016 primarily due to the surge of voting from blue-collar rural Wisconsin, according to the New York Times, the youth vote in Madison and Milwaukee, with other blue upticks in Eau Claire, La Crosse and Green Bay, seem to have been a driving cause in state’s Democratic flip. As the results of that contest remain unclear — with some states yet to announce a winner and the president’s twitter account casting doubt on the integrity of the election — we took a look through the eyes of UW-Madison current and past students at what hangs in the balance.How do you feel about President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden as candidates? “For years, the notion of holding my nose while I vote for the lesser of two evils is tempered in this election because our current President [and] his supporters -including Republican representatives at all levels- have exemplified evil in unprecedented ways,” said Brian Bedford, UW Odyssey class of 1974. Rose Kelleher, a sophomore at UW-Madison, was passionate about this election because of the insensitivity that President Donald Trump has shown in the past four years. “I am voting in this election because I think that this country needs real leadership which has not been shown in the last four years of Trump’s term,” said Kelleher. “It really makes me sick to my stomach that the president currently in office is blatantly racist, homophobic and a sexual offender. Every time I hear Trump speak, I am astounded at the lack of thought put into his arbitrary statements. I think much of the country is tired of listening to his bullsh**, and is ready for some real change to occur in our country, which is why I voted for Joe Biden.” The harsh reality of a democratic leaning campus, along with the political climate that surrounds a Trump presidency, means that many conservative-leaning students are weary of voicing their political views in fear of retaliation from their peers. “From the left side, there has been an aggressive mindset where if you’re white you are racist, and if you say you’re not, you are very racist. Basically anyone who doesn’t agree with them is 'canceled' into today’s world,” junior Dawson Bauer said. “This has been shown time and time again in these past months especially in UW students. I guarantee every UW student has seen daily posts on social media that all have the same message: if you vote for Trump, we can’t be friends because you are a terrible person and you are a racist.”In addition to questioning President Trump’s leadership, it is evident that many youth voters are concerned with how the future president will handle the racial tension in our country. “As a woman and person of color, I strongly believe this election will have a long lasting impact on my community and the course of my future,” said Karen Hayes, a senior at UW-Madison. “Electing a more competent leader is only the beginning, but it is a necessary step that I hope our country [took].” Hersh Pareek, a sophomore at UW-Madison, argued that, no matter who wins this election, the two-party system limits the political choice necessary to make change for marginalized communities.“I think voting is really important, especially for the 2020 election,” Pareek said. “But at the same time, I don’t want to pressure people of color or indigenous people to vote for Biden because I know both parties won’t be able to solve systemic racism. While I think voting is really important, I don’t think indigenous people and people of color should be obligated to vote under a two-party system that will always continue to oppress them.”Bauer believes that the silent Republican “majority,” in Madison specifically, is due to the controversy surrounding President Trump as a candidate. “The name calling, online bullying and being an outcast to your community, especially in minority ones, has created the silent Trump voter such as myself,” Bauer said. “I personally am an independent voter and would have supported a better Democratic nominee easily — such Andrew Yang — but I think Trump is the lesser evil from the two candidates. But I feel like I can’t post anything on social media about my political beliefs without being ‘canceled’, losing friends and ruining my social life just because I don’t support Biden.” Yet, other students still believe since “polarizing issues” such as abortion and reproductive rights are on the line, students much consider those around them and think about the negative ramifications that surround their choice for president. “This election is a battle between progress and suppression, of autonomy and support, versus disruption, chaos and lies,” said Brooke Wilczewski, a junior at UW-Madison. “While neither candidate is arguably a lot of people’s first choice, this coming candidate will determine who our nation is as a country for generations to come. It is important that we all take action and fight for all people. Even if such decisions don’t affect you personally, think about all of those in your inner circle that it does.”What specific political issues swayed your vote in this election? According to Mathew Mitnick, Associated Students of Madison Chair, this election is about more than choosing a new president: It’s about voting to combat climate change, defund and abolish the police, ensure affordable housing and democracy itself, amongst other issues. “The current administration has shown that they don’t know how to uphold the freedoms that citizens are granted and abuse their power to better their own business,” said Ava Kaminski, current fellow for the Biden campaign in Madison. “They’re not for the people, they’re for themselves and 45 does not deserve to hold that seat anymore. People’s rights and livelihoods are up for grabs in this election, and I couldn’t just stand by and watch while we were fighting for our democracy.” Bauer cited the left for creating the racial tension in our country, indicating democratic media outlets as the culprits. “They are the people who would immediately report on every single shooting of a black person without knowing all of the facts which created the mob mentality of rioting,” Bauer said. “It was a month before it was shown that George Floyd was on enough fentanyl to kill an average person. Now this isn’t an excuse or saying that I or people who voted for Trump thought that his death was okay. But I didn’t want to jump to conclusions before I knew all the facts. The media these days don’t care about the facts but instead want to support this rioting and then blame it on Trump.” Climate change and racial injustice are central for this election to Pareek and many others. Pareek said that a Biden White House will not solve systematic racism, but will put forth policies that aim to help minorities and underrepresented people. “For me, this election is the harbinger to another civil war,” Bedford said. “From my lens as a 61-year-old, Black, father of five wonderful children, including four adults; a long-time family advocate, educator and activist, I see any illusion of a democracy in great peril.” What changes do you hope to see in our democracy after this election? Many students at UW-Madison were outraged by the suppressive voter laws in the state of Wisconsin, according to Mitnick. By having to obtain a separate, government-issued Voter ID, some students felt that their voices were being suppressed, causing many of them to fight harder for their voice to be heard. “I would also like to see UW-Madison make a greater commitment to voting. ASM unanimously passed legislation to cancel synchronous classes on Election Day,” said Bedford. “This request has not been met. UW's failure to implement this proposal further serves as another voter suppression tactic. We need to make it as easy as possible for students to vote!""Bedford also explained that the 2020 presidential election is a huge opportunity to expose systemic issues and change for the better.“I believe that our whole political system has been flawed and broken since the birth of this nation,” Bedford said. “Since its inception, our political model was designed to keep mostly privileged white men in power, the same men that are puppets to the special interests that have polluted our political system with dirty money. This election will ignite the fuse that will blow away the false veneer that has hidden the hypocrisies that this nation was founded on.”Bauer posed the question of minorities being the ones who have suffered the most at the hands of a democratic government. “I think the real people who have suffered the most from the left are the minorities. Most cities have been under democratic control for decades, and those are where the real racial issues still are today,” Bauer said. “The right side is tired of all of the Democratic hate and empty promises. There have been more minorities to vote for Trump this year than his last election. That fact alone shows that the left’s false promises and constant bullying are starting to push people away, yet there is still a fear about letting it be known you don’t support the Democrats in this election.”Professors here at UW-Madison have been incredibly vocal about the issue of political polarization in the United States. According to John Zumbrunnen, political science professor at UW-Madison, the country is currently in a time of intense partisan polarization and we have many important norms that have shaped U.S. politics overturned or ignored. “The current state of the world is dependent on this upcoming election,” said Jonah Rubinitz, junior at UW-Madison. “I know there are a ton of young voters out there who think that their vote does not make a difference, when it's the most important demographic of the election. 2020 has been a terrible year for many people, and I hope that this election will change the state of the world for the better.” ",We asked UW students: What does this election mean to you?,UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/04/when-youre-not-safer-at-home-how-city-state-services-are-supporting-domestic-abuse-victims-during-quarantine,"April 30, 2020 | 2:49pm CDT","Similar to a rapidly spreading infection, data suggests domestic abuse is proliferating around the world in conditions created by the coronavirus pandemic.Across the globe, as more and more individuals are quarantined at home with state-mandated ""shelter-in-place"" orders, there’s been a surge in cases of domestic abuse calls, the New York Times reported.Along with Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Seattle, who have publicly stated they are seeing increases in domestic violence allegations, Shannon Barry, Executive Director of Domestic Abuse Intervention Services, anticipates the same for Madison.In addition to its domestic violence shelter and 24-hour helpline, DAIS provides legal advocacy, emergency safety planning, support groups, children’s programming and primary prevention and education programs for the Madison area.Keeping Operations Going During COVID-19But approximately six weeks before the end of 2019, United Way of Dane County informed Barry they were pulling their investments in DAIS’ programs, in what amounted to almost $200,000 a year, after 42 years. “[It] was a huge blow for the organization and one that we weren’t really anticipating,” Barry said. “We were going to step up and do what we could do to fundraise to fill that gap, but the pandemic has really limited the intensive fundraising that we need to do.”With the spread of COVID-19, DAIS had to close their business office and postpone their biggest fundraiser of the year, facing a potentially significant revenue shortfall.Fortunately, in late March, they received a $58,000 grant in emergency shelter funding from Dane County, along with a grant from the Boys and Girls Club, to maintain services during the pandemic.“DAIS is an invaluable organization in our community, and we are committed to making sure those experiencing domestic abuse continue to have access to essential resources, especially during this challenging time,” Dane County Executive Joe Parisi said.The county’s grant will help ensure the continued operations of Dane County’s only shelter for domestic violence victims as well as the DAIS’ helpline, a service Barry said is more important now than previously. “We anticipate that we are going to see more people contacting us, even if the relationship hadn't escalated previously to physical abuse,” Barry said. Additionally, Barry said she also expects a higher volume of domestic abuse calls to law enforcement. Domestic Violence Calls and the Potential Toll of Economic StressSince Gov. Tony Evers’ implemented Wisconsin’s “Safer-at-Home” order on March 25, Madison Police Department has had an average of 8.75 domestic violence calls a day — a slight 4 percent increase from before the order was in place.The order is now set to continue until May 26 — a prolongation heavily contested by state Republicans and the reason for protests across the state. But it also raises concern longer movement limits will lead to even more cases of intimate partner violence. “The irony is the Governor's executive order is called ‘Safer-at-Home’ and for many people home is the least safe place,” Barry said. “DAIS will continue to be available during this time and when [the] safer at home orders are lifted. We are prepared and ready to respond.”Barry added everyone knows someone who's been affected by intimate partner violence — just not everyone discloses that information.In some cities, domestic abuse reports are actually decreasing, causing even more concern victims are unable to alert authorities from state officials.""We're having 10 fewer crime reports each day for instances of domestic violence,"" Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore told ABC News. ""That's going in the wrong direction with what we believe is actually happening behind closed doors.""Data shows when families or couples experience economic stress, rates of domestic violence increase.DAIS saw this trend during the 2008 economic recession. Between 2008 and 2009, there was a 108 percent increase in the number of people contacting them seeking shelter services. They expect to see it again during the coronavirus pandemic too.“Now, we have a situation where people are struggling financially,” Barry said. “There's a lot of fear and anxiety within our community about this illness, and, on top of that, you have…a whole other layer of stress as families have [everyone] home together at once.”Despite the potential for increased domestic abuse rates, state efforts remain to help mitigate some of the adverse effects of the pandemic for victims of abuse.Safe at Home: The Significance of a Protective State ProgramSafe at Home, a program established by state law in 2017 and housed within the Department of Justice, works with local advocacy agencies, like DAIS, to provide address confidentiality for abuse victims. The program is available to those who have experienced any kind of abuse — such as trafficking, domestic abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse and stalking — or certify they are in fear of their physical safety. The DOJ acts as a repository of their actual address, issuing a substitute one used for all intents and purposes and then forwards mail to each participant’s actual household.With lots of important documents being sent in the mail during the pandemic, Safe at Home — not to be confused with the Governor’s executive order “Safer-at-Home” — is focused on maintaining the continuity of the program, according to program director Erin Welsh. The program has received an increased volume of calls from individuals looking to get additional information on the Governor's order due to the similarity in the name.Welsh said not only is she able to point those callers toward reliable sources, but she also uses the opportunity to inform them on the Safe at Home program itself.“We want to connect with local advocacy agencies to make sure they can provide continued services and continue to help folks enroll in the program,” Welsh said. “It's [also] really important to be able to continue to forward mail to our current participants. Just because our operations may be somewhat limited and folks might be working from home doesn't mean our services are any less important.”If anything, receiving physical mail is more significant now than it’s been the past several years — especially with the pandemic coinciding with a historic election cycle.Enrolling in the Safe at Home program allows participants to become a confidential voter, meaning they aren’t required to disclose their address when registering or voting. But, in order to do so, they need a confidential elector affidavit and they must do it in person, posing a safety issue during the pandemic.Welsh spent the past month prioritizing election materials, making sure all affidavits were updated and filed with their respective clerks in a timely manner. “I think, like anyone else, folks scrambled at the last minute to figure out how [they] can vote safely,” Welsh said. “And that means not just in light of COVID, but other security needs for our participants.”Welsh also forwards on tax forms, unemployment checks, stimulus checks and kids’ school materials.“We're responsible for that information,” she added. “It's just figuring it out and maintaining the level of service our participants need to stay safe and continue to function the best they can as they figure this out themselves.”At the end of the day, Welsh said both Safe at Home and local advocacy agencies have the same goal: getting the message out that services are still available to those who need them. Anyone in need of assistance or services can call DAIS’ helpline at (608) 251-4445. Those with less crisis-based issues can email the helpline at crisisline@abuseintervention.org.","When you’re not ‘safer at home’: How city, state services are supporting domestic abuse victims during quarantine",UWM

The show is a time-tested and breathtaking foray into the issues of abuse, redemption and love and this national tour cast stays true to those themes. The incredible show is one of a few different adaptations stemming from Alice Walker’s original 1982 book. Steven Spielberg adapted it into a movie starring Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey in 1985, upon which the 2005 Broadway musical was based, garnering 11 Tony nominations. In 2015, it was announced that the London production would be staged on Broadway with Cynthia Erivo in the main role of Celie along with Jennifer Hudson and “Orange Is the New Black’s” Danielle Brooks. The Revival was nominated for four Tonys, winning two. The show opens with the full cast standing on the bare, simplistic, four level stage, with two of the show’s main characters, Celie (played incredibly by Mariah Lyttle) and Nettie (Nashka Derosiers), singing a playful and optimistic song that is reminiscent of playground ditties, “Opening / Mysterious Ways.” The only set pieces used are a few straw baskets and a variety of simple wooden chairs that hang on the back wall between scenes. This visually simplistic design gives a similar tone to Walker’s book, which tells its heartbreaking story entirely by way of letters.Other elements of the original book come through very clearly in the musical, especially considering the book is nearly 40 years old. The lyrics for the musical often echo Celie’s letters in the book by beginning a song with “Dear God,” but the portion of the book that is most mirrored in the musical comes in the show’s final number, “The Color Purple (Reprise).” The song begins with the same line that begins the final letter in the book, and ends with almost the exact same line as the book: “I don’t think us feel old at all. I think this is the youngest us ever felt. Amen.” The story is a complicated narrative involving love and heartbreak as well as other topics that aren’t often addressed in mainstream media such as physical and sexual abuse. All of the actresses who have played Celie, from Goldberg in the film, LaChanze in the 2005 musical, Erivo in the 2016 revival, and now Lyttle in the national tour, have needed to portray an incredibly wide range of emotions. She suffers abuse from her husband, heartbreak from the woman she falls in love with, intense anger towards her husband for hiding letters from her sister and finally forgiveness for those that have wronged her. Lyttle beautifully represented all of these emotions. The one thing I felt diminished Lyttle’s performance was the sound levels on some of her show-stopping songs. You could see her passion on stage, but I felt the sound of her voice didn’t hit the audience as strongly as it could’ve. Other actors also had incredibly passionate performances, most notably Chédra Arielle as Sofia and Sandie Lee as Shug Avery. What caught my ear the most was their spectacular ability to riff and make awe-inspiring vocal runs to embellish whatever note or line they were singing. Almost all of the characters did this to an extent, but I thought Arielle and Lee blew the house down in this department. Their talent gave the show a fresh feeling, allowing the audience to feel like this show was totally different from the last performance.The music felt very convincing due to the obvious blues, jazz and gospel influences infused in its music, written by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray. Considering the setting of the show, the cultural struggles it represents and the themes it discusses, it makes perfect sense that the show would utilize specific musical traditions to evoke the feelings of despair from the blues, faith from gospel and hope from jazz. Bluesy songs like “Big Dog” and “Push da Button” feel like they were pulled straight from the Mississippi Delta, and songs like “Hell No!” and “Brown Betty” sample gospel music with their repeated use of call and response. By using elements of different kinds of historically African-American music, the writers allow the audience to reside in a very believable musical landscapeOne of the lighter and most entertaining elements of the show were the Church Ladies, played by Elizabeth Adabale, Parris Lewis and Shelby A. Sykes. In the first act, the three women would come on stage between every few scenes and sing a short, humorous song (“That Fine Mister,” “A Tree Named Sophia”) recapping a previous scene or previewing the next. Adabale, Lewis and Sykes were masterful with their rhythm locked tightly together, providing comic relief to the often dark and heavy show. In a word, this show is phenomenal. In its explorations of the emotional topics embedded in the original book, the show takes the entire audience on a journey that is impossible to stop thinking about.",'The Color Purple' brings talent to Madison on national tour,UWM

In his letter, Speaker Vos emphasized that it is “unacceptable” that the university requires graduate students to take a class that he believes “instills the university’s negative opinion of white students and the idea that students should feel guilty simply because of their race.”Jack Phillips, a graduate student and member of both the Associated Students of Madison (ASM) and the Teaching Assistants Association (TAA), who has participated in the UHS course described their concerns with Vos’ letter and his portrayal of the course. “I did go back and look at what I could from the course to refresh my memory,” Phillip said. “The course that I took covers violence prevention strategies, support structures for victims of violence and abuse, and mechanisms for reporting violence.” Phillips emphasized that they never felt uncomfortable participating in the course and that there was no mention of the phrases “Critical Race Theory” or “Critical Race Feminism” when they referred back. The course in reference is a two hour online webinar called “Graduate and Professional Students Preventing and Responding to Sexual and Relationship Violence,” which incoming graduate students are required to take in order to enroll in classes. University Health Services (UHS) administers the course and said that the program aims to enhance students understanding of sexual assult and harrasment, effective prevention strategies, available campus resources and victim rights. “I’ve never heard of anyone with reservations about this course nor feelings of alienation from it,” Phillips said, noting that graduate students and workers are more concerned about other issues facing the community than Speaker Vos' letter.The violence prevention course, as reported by the Wisconsin State Journal, references how privilege can feed institutional power that can create dangerous, racist structures, stating that Critical Race Theory can help students understand “how a regime of white supremacy and its subordination of people of color have been created and maintained in America.”“If Speaker Vos wishes to support graduate students, he should propose adequately funding public education and support the current effort of several lawmakers to repeal Act 55, which killed shared governance at UW-Madison,” Phillips continued. Ultimately, Phillips believes that Speaker Vos is attempting to cause “moral panic” around Critical Race Theory. “This moral panic is essentially genocide denial applied to centuries of slavery and its lasting impacts on our nation,” Phillips said, emphasizing that Critical Race Theory is often utilized in political agendas. “Rep. Vos is pushing an explicitly fascist talking point and wants to set the stage for a long, slow genocide of marginalized groups by eliminating reference to us in any education materials.” Describing the usage of Critical Race Theory in Vos’ political rhetoric as “astroturfed,” Phillips emphasized their concern about potential violence on-campus and in the greater Madison area community as educational institutions such as school boards, for example, have been a point of tension with far-right militias due to policy and curriculum decisions around the country.“By stoking outrage over UW-Madison’s violence prevention initiative with this language, Vos is essentially inviting militias to the UW campus,” said Phillips. In response to Speaker Vos’ letter, ASM also reiterated support for the university’s use of the violence prevention initiative.“ASM stands behind UW-Madison’s ‘Graduate and Professional Students Preventing and Responding to Sexual and Relationship Violence’ education webinar … we defend the program’s race-conscious content, as marginalized individuals and groups disproportionately experience sexual and relationship violence,” the Nov. 22 statement reads.Blank, who Speaker Vos’ letter was directed toward, has yet to publicly comment or release a statement.

The Associated Students of Madison Student Council had just passed new legislation that will fight to fix the language in the Wisconsin State Legislature about shared governance, which guarantees students and faculty are involved in the decision making for campus policies.“It was good to have something to actually show for all the effort put in last year,” ASM Chair Adrian Lampron said Wednesday, after the council met in person for the first time since the pandemic began. The vote passed with 21 members in favor and only one member against the legislation. However, this is “ideally the bare minimum,” said Legislative Affairs Chair Muralidharan Govindarajan, who was responsible for starting the legislation in April.Now that the legislation has passed, ASM will proceed by contacting state legislators about organizing a hearing and pitching their case to bring back the language in state statute 36.09(5), which was changed six years ago and removed the voice UW students had to make decisions in campus wide policies.In 2015, Governor Scott Walker passed an act that would change this statute from allowing students “primary responsibility for the formulation and review of policies” to having “primary responsibility for advising the Chancellor.”The decision to change the language in the state statute took UW students “from active participants to suddenly this subordinate role to the Chancellor,” said ASM Press Office Director Tyler Katzenberger. “It’s highly important making sure student voices [are] heard, and student opinions are reflected in campus policies.”Although ASM has attempted to regain the voice and power for UW students by passing this legislation practically unanimously, UW students and faculty still won’t be able to hold any real power in campus decisions until they set up a meeting with legislators, and the statute is changed on a state level. ASM also discussed other issues to tackle throughout the year, such as fossil fuel divestment in the Sustainability Committee and advocacy for more mental health services and sexual abuse prevention in the Equity and Inclusion Committee.For many UW-Madison students and ASM members, like Govindarajan, passing this legislation wasn’t just a step in the right direction toward shared governance for UW-Madison students — it was also an opportunity to advocate for shared governance for students in other institutions throughout the state as well.“I’m happy that this is going in the direction that I want it, and students will finally get the voice that they lost six years ago,” Govindarajan said. “But we’re hoping to get that hearing, and we’re hoping to use that to get some momentum on this.”","ASM passes legislation intended to restore shared governance for UW students, faculty",UWM
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/09/privilege-and-power,"September 16, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","For some of us in the world, the fight to belong somewhere in this vastly large, yet woefully vacant place has been relentless; hurled into an endlessly turbulent expedition, some of us have been fervently yearning for the sweet comfort of an accepting community. On the other hand, some of us have been privileged enough to be indoctrinated from birth into automatic social acceptance, power and prestige.Today, communities serve as security havens, framed as hundreds of outlets aiding people in making sense of their collective experiences. Community is culture, community is civilization, community is family — or rather, community is our identity. Moreover, the tangency of such a concept is seen to materialize itself in film, books and art that reflect back as well as represent these appropriate identities. But what begins to unfold once these communities and social institutions begin to collapse, or worse, become infiltrated?Without realizing it, perhaps, Billie Eilish has not only infiltrated but exploited the LGBTQIA+ community for her personal gain and fame.After releasing an intimate music video for her new release “Lost Cause” this past pride month, the 20-year-old pop singer turned cultural icon has received very minimal backlash over “queer-baiting”: a marketing ploy in which heterosexual celebrities falsely orchestrate fabricated same-sexual activity on mass-media platforms to instigate controversy.The music video depicts Eilish with a group of 6 other girls engaging in several intimate interactions such as kissing and reciprocating physical affection. However, although the video has garnered some criticism, it has yet to ascend to the magnitude of needed reprimand for devaluing and fetishizing queerness. Eilish’s video perpetuates a series of damaging stereotypes: degrading behavior that previous heterosexual artists have taken advantage of for years on end. Eilish has abused her commercial presence, not for the greater good of spreading awareness, education or supporting LGBTQIA+ initiatives and campaigns, but to catapult her into a wider realm of publicity through a measure of controversy off the backs of an already prejudiced community. Despite “Lost Cause” being released during pride month, the lyrics are completely void of any mentioning of queer love, self-acceptance or the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. Instead of bringing awareness to the queer community to normalize marginalized sexualities, Eilish selfishly exploited the community by displaying sexual ambiguity to appeal to her LGBTQIA+ fans and bring in a larger audience. Not only this, but she has generated lots of press through confusing the general public on her sexuality. Her actions are only made worse after realizing that Billie is involved in a relationship with Mathew Tyler Vorcec — a man who has faced ridicule for his openly homophobic comments. It seems as though the youthful artist does not seem to value the emotions of her queer fans nor the ethical offense that she has committed towards the community as a whole. Eilish has infiltrated the community, exploited it for personal gain and misguided a marginalized people that covet nothing more than authentic representation. Unfortunately, yet not surprising, the American singer has yet to receive any major criticism for her blatant exploitation of queer culture. But how can someone evade public retribution after exhibiting such derogatory actions? Simply, it is due to her place of privilege and power. When a group holds dominance, social superiority and systematic power over others, they can willingly control the narrative with which they can avoid criticism and paint other social groups as inferior or faulty. It seems as though Eilish’s whiteness and heterosexuality — two socially dominant characteristics — act as barriers that withstand negative social affiliation and condemnation. There stands a glaring flaw when Eilish’s privilege and power allows the singer  to misleadingly emulate and give an illusory perception of gay culture to a young, impressionable audience when certain artists of color still struggle with coming out. Moreover, Eilish’s actions are a direct reflection of the current exploitation of discriminated minorities by groups of higher power. In proving such, the young artist and rapper Lil Nas X was under immense heat for his recent single “Montero: Call Me by Your Name” where he had clips of explicit queer, sexual expressions. While certain critics claim that the song was banned because of religious innuendos, several other music videos and songs could be deemed blasphemous such as “God is a Woman” by Ariana Grande and “Judas” by Lady Gaga, both of which did not receive as bad of a reception as Lil Nas X’s video. It seems as though for the white artists, their privilege sheltered them from mass criticism. Accordingly, this delves into the greater generational dilemma of how bodies of power can take advantage of discriminated groups without facing consequences; this is a parasitic relationship where they feed off their backs and exploit them for further personal gain. In this situation, the white heterosexual woman stands towering over queer folk who are struggling to live an authentic life, living with often unaccepting parents and a system that has deemed their lives abnormal.In spite of these existing conditions, Eilish is here — reaping the benefits from embodying a minority group while escaping all the disgrace and complexities that accompany it. It is so easy for Eilish to get away with queer-baiting while those who are not fortunate to be guarded by privilege must face the harsh reality of hate speech or possible death over their actual identities. What Eilish can choose to live out in one day is someone’s eternal struggle until they die. Billie Eilish’s whiteness and supposed heterosexuality function as an overarching armor that resists life-altering criticism. Ultimately, bodies of power cannot simply continue to use, subjugate and ignore marginalized and underrepresented groups for fame and power. We must refuse to let this go on — enough is enough.Abdullah Marei is a junior studying psychology.

Childhood trauma is followed by success and its consequences, usually including addiction and love trouble. A chronicle of artistic triumph doubles as a cautionary tale, with ruin and redemption wrapped around each other. If all else fails, the soundtrack music offers occasional reminders of why we should care.""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday,"" directed by Lee Daniels from a script by the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, follows the standard template, with a few new elements added to the mix. Concentrating on the last dozen years of Holiday's life — she was 44 when she died of liver disease in 1959 — the movie flashes back to her grim childhood and expands to include many facets of her life and personality.She suffers abuse at the hands of a series of men and relentless persecution from the government. The only lover who treats her well is also an undercover agent. We see Holiday as a heroin user, a devoted but not always reliable friend and an operatic figure of towering pain and sublime resilience. But not really as an artist. Andra Day, who plays Holiday, is a canny and charismatic performer. The film's hectic narrative is punctuated with nightclub and concert-hall scenes that capture some of the singer's magnetism. Rather than lip-sync the numbers, Day sings them in a voice with some of Holiday's signature breathy rasp and delicate lilt and suggests her ability to move from whimsy to anguish and back in the space of a phrase.And while Daniels and Day convey a plausible sense of Holiday's magnetism in front of an audience, ""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday"" shows little interest in the discipline and craft that made those indelible nightclub and concert-hall moments possible. The saxophonist Lester Young (Tyler James Williams) is a ubiquitous but peripheral presence, appearing more as a fellow addict than an indispensable creative partner. At one point, you hear him mutter something about ""C sharp"" but that is about all the musical talk the movie has time for.Instead, the film focuses on episodes drawn from ""Chasing the Scream,"" Johann Hari's journalistic history of the war on drugs. Holiday was a particular obsession of Harry Anslinger (Garrett Hedlund), an anti-narcotics zealot at the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. In Hari's account, his hounding of her was motivated in no small part by racism, especially by his hatred of ""Strange Fruit,"" the harrowing anti-lynching tone poem that Holiday first recorded in 1939.There is real power in the story of a song so incendiary, so shockingly truthful, so likely to fan the flames of an entire civil rights movement that the American government sees it as a threat that must be stopped. And while that is part of the narrative — exploring the legacy of the legendary jazz singer and her haunting, unflinching song ""Strange Fruit,"" about lynchings in the American South — it is a thread that is often lost among a portrait of Holiday's life and the world she inhabited.But it is not, for all that, entirely unwatchable. Daniels' strength as a director lies less in his taste for histrionics and provocation than in his skill at observing quieter moments. He is a great choreographer of bodies at rest and casual conversations. The best parts of ""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday"" take place in dressing rooms, hotel suites and backstage lounges, during an impromptu softball game or a stroll in Central Park. With her friends — notably Roslyn (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), Miss Freddy (Miss Lawrence) and Tallulah Bankhead (Natasha Lyonne) — Billie is witty, profane, generous and sometimes mean, but always something other than a victim or a symbol.For all that the film often lingers on uncomfortable imagery — with historical footage of Black victims of white violence and depictions of forceful sexual encounters — there is a real purpose to the presentation and cinematography. One remarkable single-shot sequence sees Holiday leave her tour bus and accidentally stumble upon the horrifying aftermath of a lynching. She breaks down in the victim's house, staggers into a backstage room where she prepares to shoot up before eventually being shepherded onto a stage, where she finally performs ""Strange Fruit"" in full. In that central moment, Daniels knows exactly what he has, the camera remaining firmly on Day's face across the entire song. If only the rest of the film was this clear and incisive in its vision.The film too often feels stilted and inert, jumping from incident to incident without really getting to the heart of Holiday herself. With an array of side-characters that drift in and out of the story, the film often feels more like a story about the world, the people, the forces around Holiday than Holiday herself. But even there, it cannot quite commit to the most interesting threads. For all its zig-zagging attention span and clunky dialogue, what ""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday"" does is an arresting central performance from American singer Andra Day. Her Holiday is complex, constantly battling all manner of horrors the world throws her way, sometimes charming, other times impossible. And as a performer herself, Day is commanding in the on-stage sequences, her husky tone perfectly suited to inhabiting Holiday's smoky vocals. In the title role, singer Andra Day inhabits Holiday with such intensity that she partially redeems the movie. But there is a major caveat: You will likely spend the whole running time wishing Day had been given a vehicle with more to say about Holiday than this one, the gist of which can be summed up as, ""That poor junkie sure could sing.""",'The United States Vs.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/boycott-the-beijing-olympics,"April 22, 2021 | 2:00am CDT","What is the point of taking history class? This is a question that my middle school history teacher would often ask his students on the first day of school. The answer was always “so that we can learn from the past, therefore, not to make the same mistakes in the future.”“It’s amazing how frequently history repeats itself,” he would say.In 1931, the International Olympic Committee chose Germany to host the 1936 Summer Olympics. Two years later, Adolph Hitler and his villainous Aryan supremacy theory came to power. In 1935, the Nazi regime announced the “Nuremberg Race Laws.” These laws prohibited Jewish people from attaining German citizenship and forbade them from marrying or having sexual relations with people of “German related blood.” The laws extended the definition of a Jewish person from an individual who held specific religious beliefs to someone who had multiple Jewish grandparents. Jewish athletes were also prohibited from competing on the 1936 German Olympic team. The Nazi regime’s vitriolic acts of anti-Semitism troubled enough Americans to spark a movement in favor of boycotting the 1936 Olympics in Germany. Among the most fervent supporters for a boycott was the Amateur Athletic Union — which was composed of Olympic athletes. In response, the American Olympic Committee dispatched some of their members to visit Germany and assess the status of German Jewish athletes. On their visit, members of the American Olympic Committee asked Jewish athletes if they were being provided a fair chance to compete. The Jewish athletes, who were asked these questions while in the presence of the Gestapo, assured the American Olympic Committee that they were being treated fairly. In December of 1935, the American Olympic Committee and the Amateur Athletic Union met in New York City to vote on whether to boycott the 1936 Summer Olympics. The final vote was 58 to 55 ½ in favor of attending the 1936 Summer Olympics. Hitler would use the Olympics as a propaganda tool to reaffirm his power domestically and distract from his nefariously oppressive regime. Hitler’s subsequent actions would result in the deaths of 75 million people. It’s unlikely that the United States’ decision to attend the 1936 Olympics would have changed the course of history, but it was a mistake to give international validation to a regime that had clear oppressive practices. There is a disturbing contemporary analogous comparison to the decision to attend the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany. In 2015, the International Olympic Committee chose China to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Two years later, the Chinese Communist Party would begin sending ethnic minorities to concentration camps where they would be tortured, sterilized and sometimes killed. The ethnic minorities targeted by the Chinese Communist Party are called the Uyghurs. Go ahead and Google what’s happening to the Uyghurs in China. Because people in China can’t. The Uyghurs are a primarily Muslim ethnic population in Northwest China. There are roughly 12 million Uyghurs in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Previously making up a majority of the people in the Xinjiang region, the recent migration of Han Chinese to the Xinjiang region has caused the Uyghur population to dip below 50% of the population.The Han Chinese constitute 92% of China’s mainland population. In the late 20th century, the Chinese Communist Party began sponsoring mass migration of Han Chinese to the Xinjiang region — where a majority of the population was made up of Uyghurs. This was allegedly a coordinated attempt to eradicate Uyghur influence in the province. In 1997, the Chinese Communist Party began taking violent action against the Uyghur people. During Ramadan, Chinese officials executed 30 Uyghurs in the street for alleged disloyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. These executions lead to demonstrations by the Uyghur people, which ultimately led to more executions. In 2017, the Chinese Communist Party began abducting Uyghur people from their homes and sending them to concentration camps. Three million Uyghurs have been abducted and detained within these camps. Inside them, the Uyghur people are tortured, women are sterilized and people are murdered. In the Uyghur jurisdictions of Xinjiang, the population has decreased by 84% in the last six years. Much as the Nazi Regime practiced Aryan supremacy, the Chinese Communist Party is currently practicing Han supremacy. In January, the U.S. State Department declared that China’s actions against Uyghurs constitute crimes against humanity and are to be labeled genocide. Yet, even after determining that China is committing genocide against ethnic minorities, the United States seems intent on competing in the 2022 Winter Olympics. Much like Nazi Germany, the Chinese Communist Party will use the opportunity of hosting the Olympics to reaffirm their domestic power and burnish their image internationally. The United States must not give the Chinese Communist Party the same opportunity they gave the Nazi Regime in 1936. Instead, the U.S. must amend that mistake and stand firm against the same ethnic cleansing that took the lives of over 6 million Jews during Hitler’s reign in Nazi Germany.  The United States and its allies should band together and refuse to compete in the 2022 Olympic games if they’re played in China. A global rebuke of China’s grotesque human rights violations may not be the silver bullet solution, but it would be a tangible step in the right direction. The Chinese Communist Party is only able to commit crimes against humanity within their own borders because of the strong monopolist control they have on their domestic power. Because of the oppressive practices of the Chinese Communist Party, domestic critics are unable to destabilize the Party’s power. Change and condemnation must come from external voices. If the United States and its allies were to boycott the Olympics, that would offer a monumental admonishment of the Chinese Communist Party. The global denouncement of the Chinese Communist Party could have the potential to destabilize their monopolistic control of China and their related human rights abuses. The Chinese Communist Party is a villainous and oppressive regime. The United States can solidify its position as global advocates for freedom and liberty by taking a strong stance against the worst human rights abuse in the world today. If the United States decides to attend the 2022 Olympics in China, they will be complicit in giving the Chinese Communist Party the same validation they gave the Nazi Regime in 1936.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/02/liberal-mask-off,"February 25, 2021 | 2:00am CST","If the last four years of American political theatrics have taught us anything, it is that politicians and their kin are often made out to be celebrities, and their supporters are willing to defend their every move by mudslinging at opponents. The cult-like devotion of Trump supporters is likely to persist long into the future of the Republican party. Anyone remotely critical of their leader is immediately labeled communist or socialist, to the point that these words no longer seem to hold meaning. Ad hominem responses are rife in political discourse on social media, and the most die-hard Trump supporters deal almost exclusively in them. However, this is all well documented. Those on the receiving end of the abuse, however, do not receive nearly as much attention, when they probably should. There are two main groups on the receiving end: progressives and liberals. To Trump supporters — quite likely today’s most dominant conservative wing — they’re both one and the same, but the reality couldn’t be further from the truth. Progressive discourse is not perfect by any means and can certainly invoke ad hominems when on the defensive, but it is often centred around real-world issues. Talk is often focused on policy decisions like redistributing police budgets, raising the minimum wage, establishing universal healthcare or canceling student debt. Some might dismiss this as idealistic, but such conversations are perhaps more rooted in reality than others. Liberals, on the other hand, find themselves countering offense with more offense. They too rely strongly on ad hominem rhetoric. While an offensive approach is understandable — people around the world have felt great disgust at the recent state of affairs in America — liberals can often appear out of touch in their positions of comfort. Despite this, they can always tout the fact that they’re opposing evil in order to establish the moral high ground. In fact, this helped a handful of Twitter accounts skyrocket to popularity, as onlookers cheered them on for tweeting out direct insults at Trump and driving discourse that way. A similar formula took hold of late night television as well, to the point that monologues from every major show sounded exactly the same, hitting the same talking points and attempting to be snarky. The reality is that liberals can say a lot of objectionable things while on the offensive, the difference being that their perceived moral high ground protects them from the criticism levied at many Trump supporters. Perhaps their views aren’t necessarily as abrasive as white supremacists and their enablers, but when on the offensive, their mask of self-righteousness falls to the ground. Take the discourse surrounding Melania Trump for instance. The former first lady faced the ire of liberals, as did pretty much all of Trump’s family. A lot of it could be justified too. Her history shows instances of tone deafness, like her choice to wear the “I don’t really care, do u?” jacket while visiting detained children at the U.S. border, or when she was accused of plagiarizing Michelle Obama’s 2008 Democratic National Convention speech. Such actions should rightly be criticized. However, the liberal offensive in the last four years — and even today — leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Her modeling history and Slovenian background are often brought up to disparage her in a manner that is, quite frankly, misogynistic and unnecessary. By trying to propose what a first lady should and should not be like, self-proclaimed “feminists” are inadvertently furthering the repression they claim to stand against. Even Mark Hamill — a very active celebrity on liberal Twitter — made a rather distasteful tweet about elegance, now deleted, in response to a Breitbart tweet reshared by Donald Trump that called Melania the “most elegant first lady in American history,” which I found disappointing. Criticism of her actions is valid. Ad hominems of this nature, on the other hand, not so much. Trump’s physique and mental aptitude have also been targets of abuse. Yes, Trump himself engaged in such attacks, questioning President Biden’s mental aptitude and mocking a disabled reporter, but again, the objective is to be better and not stoop to the same level. Besides, getting under Trump’s skin did not yield any change and only ignited further mudslinging. What ultimately made the difference in the 2020 election was grassroots campaigning and issue-based rhetoric that mobilized voters, not necessarily the bile churned out in the form of ad hominems.If anything, liberals who relished hurling insults at Trump without any thought for the future presented an opportunity for Republicans who no longer backed Trump. In late 2019, the Lincoln Project was born. A super PAC run by former and current Republicans, its sole purpose was to ensure Trump — and other contesting Republicans — lost their races in the 2020 Election. The main move in the Lincoln Project’s playbook was to air targeted ads that would draw the ire of Trump and get under his skin in a way that liberals could only wish for. Such a prospect was clearly mouth-watering to liberal donors, as the PAC raised about $90 million since its inception.However, the founders — all of them seasoned Republican veterans — might very well have taken advantage of the liberal donors. For starters, the super PAC has come under fire for funneling received donations to its advisory board, spending comparatively little — only about $27 million — on advertising. The group allegedly also engages in practices that make it difficult to trace the movement of their money. Internet content creators have also fallen prey to the group, with the Lincoln Project stealing content without crediting the creators in any way. In recent days, there have also been allegations of inappropriate behavior against co-founder John Weaver, with 21 men accusing him of sending them sexually explicit messages. The raft of questions surrounding finances and John Weaver saw fellow co-founder Steve Schmidt step down from his position within the group. While there’s no doubt that the Lincoln Project helped in some way to take down Trump, and it would be wrong to write them off entirely, it is important to note that the Lincoln Project simply is not the ally that liberals think they are. A simple glance at the history of its founding members and the aforementioned accusations tells us that much. But when considering the brand of ad hominems adapted by liberals in their crusade against Trump, does this really matter to them? Is there really that much of a difference between the liberals and those on the right? I have seen remarks made by proud liberals aimed at people on food stamps, or at anyone and everyone living in red states, or simply when talented female musicians decide to express themselves by smashing a guitar like several male musicians in the past have. Misogyny and contempt for the poor are often blatant for those on the right, but far more subtle for the Lincoln Project types. It can be hard to notice, and with the moral high ground often called in favor of liberals, it is often ignored.However, when the mask falls off, there really isn’t much difference at all. Anupras is a senior Staff Writer and a sophomore studying Computer Science and journalism. Are ad hominems useful? Do you think the Lincoln Project can be trusted? Are liberals and conservatives more alike than typically thought of? Send all comments to opinion@dailycardinal.com",The liberal mask off,UWM
