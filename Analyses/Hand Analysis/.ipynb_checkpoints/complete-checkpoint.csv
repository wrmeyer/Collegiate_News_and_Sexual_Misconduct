This is a question that my middle school history teacher would often ask his students on the first day of school. The answer was always “so that we can learn from the past, therefore, not to make the same mistakes in the future.”“It’s amazing how frequently history repeats itself,” he would say.In 1931, the International Olympic Committee chose Germany to host the 1936 Summer Olympics. Two years later, Adolph Hitler and his villainous Aryan supremacy theory came to power. In 1935, the Nazi regime announced the “Nuremberg Race Laws.” These laws prohibited Jewish people from attaining German citizenship and forbade them from marrying or having sexual relations with people of “German related blood.” The laws extended the definition of a Jewish person from an individual who held specific religious beliefs to someone who had multiple Jewish grandparents. Jewish athletes were also prohibited from competing on the 1936 German Olympic team. The Nazi regime’s vitriolic acts of anti-Semitism troubled enough Americans to spark a movement in favor of boycotting the 1936 Olympics in Germany. Among the most fervent supporters for a boycott was the Amateur Athletic Union — which was composed of Olympic athletes. In response, the American Olympic Committee dispatched some of their members to visit Germany and assess the status of German Jewish athletes. On their visit, members of the American Olympic Committee asked Jewish athletes if they were being provided a fair chance to compete. The Jewish athletes, who were asked these questions while in the presence of the Gestapo, assured the American Olympic Committee that they were being treated fairly. In December of 1935, the American Olympic Committee and the Amateur Athletic Union met in New York City to vote on whether to boycott the 1936 Summer Olympics. The final vote was 58 to 55 ½ in favor of attending the 1936 Summer Olympics. Hitler would use the Olympics as a propaganda tool to reaffirm his power domestically and distract from his nefariously oppressive regime. Hitler’s subsequent actions would result in the deaths of 75 million people. It’s unlikely that the United States’ decision to attend the 1936 Olympics would have changed the course of history, but it was a mistake to give international validation to a regime that had clear oppressive practices. There is a disturbing contemporary analogous comparison to the decision to attend the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany. In 2015, the International Olympic Committee chose China to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Two years later, the Chinese Communist Party would begin sending ethnic minorities to concentration camps where they would be tortured, sterilized and sometimes killed. The ethnic minorities targeted by the Chinese Communist Party are called the Uyghurs. Go ahead and Google what’s happening to the Uyghurs in China. Because people in China can’t. The Uyghurs are a primarily Muslim ethnic population in Northwest China. There are roughly 12 million Uyghurs in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Previously making up a majority of the people in the Xinjiang region, the recent migration of Han Chinese to the Xinjiang region has caused the Uyghur population to dip below 50% of the population.The Han Chinese constitute 92% of China’s mainland population. In the late 20th century, the Chinese Communist Party began sponsoring mass migration of Han Chinese to the Xinjiang region — where a majority of the population was made up of Uyghurs. This was allegedly a coordinated attempt to eradicate Uyghur influence in the province. In 1997, the Chinese Communist Party began taking violent action against the Uyghur people. During Ramadan, Chinese officials executed 30 Uyghurs in the street for alleged disloyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. These executions lead to demonstrations by the Uyghur people, which ultimately led to more executions. In 2017, the Chinese Communist Party began abducting Uyghur people from their homes and sending them to concentration camps. Three million Uyghurs have been abducted and detained within these camps. Inside them, the Uyghur people are tortured, women are sterilized and people are murdered. In the Uyghur jurisdictions of Xinjiang, the population has decreased by 84% in the last six years. Much as the Nazi Regime practiced Aryan supremacy, the Chinese Communist Party is currently practicing Han supremacy. In January, the U.S. State Department declared that China’s actions against Uyghurs constitute crimes against humanity and are to be labeled genocide. Yet, even after determining that China is committing genocide against ethnic minorities, the United States seems intent on competing in the 2022 Winter Olympics. Much like Nazi Germany, the Chinese Communist Party will use the opportunity of hosting the Olympics to reaffirm their domestic power and burnish their image internationally. The United States must not give the Chinese Communist Party the same opportunity they gave the Nazi Regime in 1936. Instead, the U.S. must amend that mistake and stand firm against the same ethnic cleansing that took the lives of over 6 million Jews during Hitler’s reign in Nazi Germany.  The United States and its allies should band together and refuse to compete in the 2022 Olympic games if they’re played in China. A global rebuke of China’s grotesque human rights violations may not be the silver bullet solution, but it would be a tangible step in the right direction. The Chinese Communist Party is only able to commit crimes against humanity within their own borders because of the strong monopolist control they have on their domestic power. Because of the oppressive practices of the Chinese Communist Party, domestic critics are unable to destabilize the Party’s power. Change and condemnation must come from external voices. If the United States and its allies were to boycott the Olympics, that would offer a monumental admonishment of the Chinese Communist Party. The global denouncement of the Chinese Communist Party could have the potential to destabilize their monopolistic control of China and their related human rights abuses. The Chinese Communist Party is a villainous and oppressive regime. The United States can solidify its position as global advocates for freedom and liberty by taking a strong stance against the worst human rights abuse in the world today. If the United States decides to attend the 2022 Olympics in China, they will be complicit in giving the Chinese Communist Party the same validation they gave the Nazi Regime in 1936. It’s amazing how frequently history repeats itself.  Tripp Grebe is a Sophomore studying Political Science with Certificates in Political Economy, Philosophy, and Economics.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/the-united-states-vs-billie-holiday-proves-unable-to-rescue-its-heroin-from-its-own-confusion,4/27/2021,"Every great musician is one of a kind, but the biographies of great musicians — or more precisely their biopics — end up looking pretty much alike. Childhood trauma is followed by success and its consequences, usually including addiction and love trouble. A chronicle of artistic triumph doubles as a cautionary tale, with ruin and redemption wrapped around each other. If all else fails, the soundtrack music offers occasional reminders of why we should care.""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday,"" directed by Lee Daniels from a script by the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, follows the standard template, with a few new elements added to the mix. Concentrating on the last dozen years of Holiday's life — she was 44 when she died of liver disease in 1959 — the movie flashes back to her grim childhood and expands to include many facets of her life and personality.She suffers abuse at the hands of a series of men and relentless persecution from the government. The only lover who treats her well is also an undercover agent. We see Holiday as a heroin user, a devoted but not always reliable friend and an operatic figure of towering pain and sublime resilience. But not really as an artist. Andra Day, who plays Holiday, is a canny and charismatic performer. The film's hectic narrative is punctuated with nightclub and concert-hall scenes that capture some of the singer's magnetism. Rather than lip-sync the numbers, Day sings them in a voice with some of Holiday's signature breathy rasp and delicate lilt and suggests her ability to move from whimsy to anguish and back in the space of a phrase.And while Daniels and Day convey a plausible sense of Holiday's magnetism in front of an audience, ""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday"" shows little interest in the discipline and craft that made those indelible nightclub and concert-hall moments possible. The saxophonist Lester Young (Tyler James Williams) is a ubiquitous but peripheral presence, appearing more as a fellow addict than an indispensable creative partner. At one point, you hear him mutter something about ""C sharp"" but that is about all the musical talk the movie has time for.Instead, the film focuses on episodes drawn from ""Chasing the Scream,"" Johann Hari's journalistic history of the war on drugs. Holiday was a particular obsession of Harry Anslinger (Garrett Hedlund), an anti-narcotics zealot at the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. In Hari's account, his hounding of her was motivated in no small part by racism, especially by his hatred of ""Strange Fruit,"" the harrowing anti-lynching tone poem that Holiday first recorded in 1939.There is real power in the story of a song so incendiary, so shockingly truthful, so likely to fan the flames of an entire civil rights movement that the American government sees it as a threat that must be stopped. And while that is part of the narrative — exploring the legacy of the legendary jazz singer and her haunting, unflinching song ""Strange Fruit,"" about lynchings in the American South — it is a thread that is often lost among a portrait of Holiday's life and the world she inhabited.But it is not, for all that, entirely unwatchable. Daniels' strength as a director lies less in his taste for histrionics and provocation than in his skill at observing quieter moments. He is a great choreographer of bodies at rest and casual conversations. The best parts of ""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday"" take place in dressing rooms, hotel suites and backstage lounges, during an impromptu softball game or a stroll in Central Park. With her friends — notably Roslyn (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), Miss Freddy (Miss Lawrence) and Tallulah Bankhead (Natasha Lyonne) — Billie is witty, profane, generous and sometimes mean, but always something other than a victim or a symbol.For all that the film often lingers on uncomfortable imagery — with historical footage of Black victims of white violence and depictions of forceful sexual encounters — there is a real purpose to the presentation and cinematography. One remarkable single-shot sequence sees Holiday leave her tour bus and accidentally stumble upon the horrifying aftermath of a lynching. She breaks down in the victim's house, staggers into a backstage room where she prepares to shoot up before eventually being shepherded onto a stage, where she finally performs ""Strange Fruit"" in full. In that central moment, Daniels knows exactly what he has, the camera remaining firmly on Day's face across the entire song. If only the rest of the film was this clear and incisive in its vision.The film too often feels stilted and inert, jumping from incident to incident without really getting to the heart of Holiday herself. With an array of side-characters that drift in and out of the story, the film often feels more like a story about the world, the people, the forces around Holiday than Holiday herself. But even there, it cannot quite commit to the most interesting threads. For all its zig-zagging attention span and clunky dialogue, what ""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday"" does is an arresting central performance from American singer Andra Day. Her Holiday is complex, constantly battling all manner of horrors the world throws her way, sometimes charming, other times impossible. And as a performer herself, Day is commanding in the on-stage sequences, her husky tone perfectly suited to inhabiting Holiday's smoky vocals. In the title role, singer Andra Day inhabits Holiday with such intensity that she partially redeems the movie. But there is a major caveat: You will likely spend the whole running time wishing Day had been given a vehicle with more to say about Holiday than this one, the gist of which can be summed up as, ""That poor junkie sure could sing.""",'The United States Vs.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/09/privilege-and-power,9/16/2021,"For some of us in the world, the fight to belong somewhere in this vastly large, yet woefully vacant place has been relentless; hurled into an endlessly turbulent expedition, some of us have been fervently yearning for the sweet comfort of an accepting community. On the other hand, some of us have been privileged enough to be indoctrinated from birth into automatic social acceptance, power and prestige.Today, communities serve as security havens, framed as hundreds of outlets aiding people in making sense of their collective experiences. Community is culture, community is civilization, community is family — or rather, community is our identity. Moreover, the tangency of such a concept is seen to materialize itself in film, books and art that reflect back as well as represent these appropriate identities. But what begins to unfold once these communities and social institutions begin to collapse, or worse, become infiltrated?Without realizing it, perhaps, Billie Eilish has not only infiltrated but exploited the LGBTQIA+ community for her personal gain and fame.After releasing an intimate music video for her new release “Lost Cause” this past pride month, the 20-year-old pop singer turned cultural icon has received very minimal backlash over “queer-baiting”: a marketing ploy in which heterosexual celebrities falsely orchestrate fabricated same-sexual activity on mass-media platforms to instigate controversy.The music video depicts Eilish with a group of 6 other girls engaging in several intimate interactions such as kissing and reciprocating physical affection. However, although the video has garnered some criticism, it has yet to ascend to the magnitude of needed reprimand for devaluing and fetishizing queerness. Eilish’s video perpetuates a series of damaging stereotypes: degrading behavior that previous heterosexual artists have taken advantage of for years on end. Eilish has abused her commercial presence, not for the greater good of spreading awareness, education or supporting LGBTQIA+ initiatives and campaigns, but to catapult her into a wider realm of publicity through a measure of controversy off the backs of an already prejudiced community. Despite “Lost Cause” being released during pride month, the lyrics are completely void of any mentioning of queer love, self-acceptance or the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. Instead of bringing awareness to the queer community to normalize marginalized sexualities, Eilish selfishly exploited the community by displaying sexual ambiguity to appeal to her LGBTQIA+ fans and bring in a larger audience. Not only this, but she has generated lots of press through confusing the general public on her sexuality. Her actions are only made worse after realizing that Billie is involved in a relationship with Mathew Tyler Vorcec — a man who has faced ridicule for his openly homophobic comments. It seems as though the youthful artist does not seem to value the emotions of her queer fans nor the ethical offense that she has committed towards the community as a whole. Eilish has infiltrated the community, exploited it for personal gain and misguided a marginalized people that covet nothing more than authentic representation. Unfortunately, yet not surprising, the American singer has yet to receive any major criticism for her blatant exploitation of queer culture. But how can someone evade public retribution after exhibiting such derogatory actions? Simply, it is due to her place of privilege and power. When a group holds dominance, social superiority and systematic power over others, they can willingly control the narrative with which they can avoid criticism and paint other social groups as inferior or faulty. It seems as though Eilish’s whiteness and heterosexuality — two socially dominant characteristics — act as barriers that withstand negative social affiliation and condemnation. There stands a glaring flaw when Eilish’s privilege and power allows the singer  to misleadingly emulate and give an illusory perception of gay culture to a young, impressionable audience when certain artists of color still struggle with coming out. Moreover, Eilish’s actions are a direct reflection of the current exploitation of discriminated minorities by groups of higher power. In proving such, the young artist and rapper Lil Nas X was under immense heat for his recent single “Montero: Call Me by Your Name” where he had clips of explicit queer, sexual expressions. While certain critics claim that the song was banned because of religious innuendos, several other music videos and songs could be deemed blasphemous such as “God is a Woman” by Ariana Grande and “Judas” by Lady Gaga, both of which did not receive as bad of a reception as Lil Nas X’s video. It seems as though for the white artists, their privilege sheltered them from mass criticism. Accordingly, this delves into the greater generational dilemma of how bodies of power can take advantage of discriminated groups without facing consequences; this is a parasitic relationship where they feed off their backs and exploit them for further personal gain. In this situation, the white heterosexual woman stands towering over queer folk who are struggling to live an authentic life, living with often unaccepting parents and a system that has deemed their lives abnormal.In spite of these existing conditions, Eilish is here — reaping the benefits from embodying a minority group while escaping all the disgrace and complexities that accompany it. It is so easy for Eilish to get away with queer-baiting while those who are not fortunate to be guarded by privilege must face the harsh reality of hate speech or possible death over their actual identities. What Eilish can choose to live out in one day is someone’s eternal struggle until they die. Billie Eilish’s whiteness and supposed heterosexuality function as an overarching armor that resists life-altering criticism. Ultimately, bodies of power cannot simply continue to use, subjugate and ignore marginalized and underrepresented groups for fame and power. We must refuse to let this go on — enough is enough.Abdullah Marei is a junior studying psychology.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/10/asm-passes-legislation-intended-to-restore-shared-governance-for-uw-students-and-faculty,10/1/2021,"Enthusiastic clapping echoed throughout the hearing room, and even though representatives’ faces were partly hidden behind masks, smiling eyes could still be seen lighting up the room on Wednesday night. The Associated Students of Madison Student Council had just passed new legislation that will fight to fix the language in the Wisconsin State Legislature about shared governance, which guarantees students and faculty are involved in the decision making for campus policies.“It was good to have something to actually show for all the effort put in last year,” ASM Chair Adrian Lampron said Wednesday, after the council met in person for the first time since the pandemic began. The vote passed with 21 members in favor and only one member against the legislation. However, this is “ideally the bare minimum,” said Legislative Affairs Chair Muralidharan Govindarajan, who was responsible for starting the legislation in April.Now that the legislation has passed, ASM will proceed by contacting state legislators about organizing a hearing and pitching their case to bring back the language in state statute 36.09(5), which was changed six years ago and removed the voice UW students had to make decisions in campus wide policies.In 2015, Governor Scott Walker passed an act that would change this statute from allowing students “primary responsibility for the formulation and review of policies” to having “primary responsibility for advising the Chancellor.”The decision to change the language in the state statute took UW students “from active participants to suddenly this subordinate role to the Chancellor,” said ASM Press Office Director Tyler Katzenberger. “It’s highly important making sure student voices [are] heard, and student opinions are reflected in campus policies.”Although ASM has attempted to regain the voice and power for UW students by passing this legislation practically unanimously, UW students and faculty still won’t be able to hold any real power in campus decisions until they set up a meeting with legislators, and the statute is changed on a state level. ASM also discussed other issues to tackle throughout the year, such as fossil fuel divestment in the Sustainability Committee and advocacy for more mental health services and sexual abuse prevention in the Equity and Inclusion Committee.For many UW-Madison students and ASM members, like Govindarajan, passing this legislation wasn’t just a step in the right direction toward shared governance for UW-Madison students — it was also an opportunity to advocate for shared governance for students in other institutions throughout the state as well.“I’m happy that this is going in the direction that I want it, and students will finally get the voice that they lost six years ago,” Govindarajan said. “But we’re hoping to get that hearing, and we’re hoping to use that to get some momentum on this.”","ASM passes legislation intended to restore shared governance for UW students, faculty",Wisconsin,Neutral,Neutral,0,Briefly Mentioned,Report
