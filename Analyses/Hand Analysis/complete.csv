https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/boycott-the-beijing-olympics,4/22/2021,"What is the point of taking history class? This is a question that my middle school history teacher would often ask his students on the first day of school. The answer was always “so that we can learn from the past, therefore, not to make the same mistakes in the future.”“It’s amazing how frequently history repeats itself,” he would say.In 1931, the International Olympic Committee chose Germany to host the 1936 Summer Olympics. Two years later, Adolph Hitler and his villainous Aryan supremacy theory came to power. In 1935, the Nazi regime announced the “Nuremberg Race Laws.” These laws prohibited Jewish people from attaining German citizenship and forbade them from marrying or having sexual relations with people of “German related blood.” The laws extended the definition of a Jewish person from an individual who held specific religious beliefs to someone who had multiple Jewish grandparents. Jewish athletes were also prohibited from competing on the 1936 German Olympic team. The Nazi regime’s vitriolic acts of anti-Semitism troubled enough Americans to spark a movement in favor of boycotting the 1936 Olympics in Germany. Among the most fervent supporters for a boycott was the Amateur Athletic Union — which was composed of Olympic athletes. In response, the American Olympic Committee dispatched some of their members to visit Germany and assess the status of German Jewish athletes. On their visit, members of the American Olympic Committee asked Jewish athletes if they were being provided a fair chance to compete. The Jewish athletes, who were asked these questions while in the presence of the Gestapo, assured the American Olympic Committee that they were being treated fairly. In December of 1935, the American Olympic Committee and the Amateur Athletic Union met in New York City to vote on whether to boycott the 1936 Summer Olympics. The final vote was 58 to 55 ½ in favor of attending the 1936 Summer Olympics. Hitler would use the Olympics as a propaganda tool to reaffirm his power domestically and distract from his nefariously oppressive regime. Hitler’s subsequent actions would result in the deaths of 75 million people. It’s unlikely that the United States’ decision to attend the 1936 Olympics would have changed the course of history, but it was a mistake to give international validation to a regime that had clear oppressive practices. There is a disturbing contemporary analogous comparison to the decision to attend the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany. In 2015, the International Olympic Committee chose China to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Two years later, the Chinese Communist Party would begin sending ethnic minorities to concentration camps where they would be tortured, sterilized and sometimes killed. The ethnic minorities targeted by the Chinese Communist Party are called the Uyghurs. Go ahead and Google what’s happening to the Uyghurs in China. Because people in China can’t. The Uyghurs are a primarily Muslim ethnic population in Northwest China. There are roughly 12 million Uyghurs in the Chinese region of Xinjiang. Previously making up a majority of the people in the Xinjiang region, the recent migration of Han Chinese to the Xinjiang region has caused the Uyghur population to dip below 50% of the population.The Han Chinese constitute 92% of China’s mainland population. In the late 20th century, the Chinese Communist Party began sponsoring mass migration of Han Chinese to the Xinjiang region — where a majority of the population was made up of Uyghurs. This was allegedly a coordinated attempt to eradicate Uyghur influence in the province. In 1997, the Chinese Communist Party began taking violent action against the Uyghur people. During Ramadan, Chinese officials executed 30 Uyghurs in the street for alleged disloyalty to the Chinese Communist Party. These executions lead to demonstrations by the Uyghur people, which ultimately led to more executions. In 2017, the Chinese Communist Party began abducting Uyghur people from their homes and sending them to concentration camps. Three million Uyghurs have been abducted and detained within these camps. Inside them, the Uyghur people are tortured, women are sterilized and people are murdered. In the Uyghur jurisdictions of Xinjiang, the population has decreased by 84% in the last six years. Much as the Nazi Regime practiced Aryan supremacy, the Chinese Communist Party is currently practicing Han supremacy. In January, the U.S. State Department declared that China’s actions against Uyghurs constitute crimes against humanity and are to be labeled genocide. Yet, even after determining that China is committing genocide against ethnic minorities, the United States seems intent on competing in the 2022 Winter Olympics. Much like Nazi Germany, the Chinese Communist Party will use the opportunity of hosting the Olympics to reaffirm their domestic power and burnish their image internationally. The United States must not give the Chinese Communist Party the same opportunity they gave the Nazi Regime in 1936. Instead, the U.S. must amend that mistake and stand firm against the same ethnic cleansing that took the lives of over 6 million Jews during Hitler’s reign in Nazi Germany.  The United States and its allies should band together and refuse to compete in the 2022 Olympic games if they’re played in China. A global rebuke of China’s grotesque human rights violations may not be the silver bullet solution, but it would be a tangible step in the right direction. The Chinese Communist Party is only able to commit crimes against humanity within their own borders because of the strong monopolist control they have on their domestic power. Because of the oppressive practices of the Chinese Communist Party, domestic critics are unable to destabilize the Party’s power. Change and condemnation must come from external voices. If the United States and its allies were to boycott the Olympics, that would offer a monumental admonishment of the Chinese Communist Party. The global denouncement of the Chinese Communist Party could have the potential to destabilize their monopolistic control of China and their related human rights abuses. The Chinese Communist Party is a villainous and oppressive regime. The United States can solidify its position as global advocates for freedom and liberty by taking a strong stance against the worst human rights abuse in the world today. If the United States decides to attend the 2022 Olympics in China, they will be complicit in giving the Chinese Communist Party the same validation they gave the Nazi Regime in 1936. It’s amazing how frequently history repeats itself.  Tripp Grebe is a Sophomore studying Political Science with Certificates in Political Economy, Philosophy, and Economics.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/04/the-united-states-vs-billie-holiday-proves-unable-to-rescue-its-heroin-from-its-own-confusion,4/27/2021,"Every great musician is one of a kind, but the biographies of great musicians — or more precisely their biopics — end up looking pretty much alike. Childhood trauma is followed by success and its consequences, usually including addiction and love trouble. A chronicle of artistic triumph doubles as a cautionary tale, with ruin and redemption wrapped around each other. If all else fails, the soundtrack music offers occasional reminders of why we should care.""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday,"" directed by Lee Daniels from a script by the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, follows the standard template, with a few new elements added to the mix. Concentrating on the last dozen years of Holiday's life — she was 44 when she died of liver disease in 1959 — the movie flashes back to her grim childhood and expands to include many facets of her life and personality.She suffers abuse at the hands of a series of men and relentless persecution from the government. The only lover who treats her well is also an undercover agent. We see Holiday as a heroin user, a devoted but not always reliable friend and an operatic figure of towering pain and sublime resilience. But not really as an artist. Andra Day, who plays Holiday, is a canny and charismatic performer. The film's hectic narrative is punctuated with nightclub and concert-hall scenes that capture some of the singer's magnetism. Rather than lip-sync the numbers, Day sings them in a voice with some of Holiday's signature breathy rasp and delicate lilt and suggests her ability to move from whimsy to anguish and back in the space of a phrase.And while Daniels and Day convey a plausible sense of Holiday's magnetism in front of an audience, ""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday"" shows little interest in the discipline and craft that made those indelible nightclub and concert-hall moments possible. The saxophonist Lester Young (Tyler James Williams) is a ubiquitous but peripheral presence, appearing more as a fellow addict than an indispensable creative partner. At one point, you hear him mutter something about ""C sharp"" but that is about all the musical talk the movie has time for.Instead, the film focuses on episodes drawn from ""Chasing the Scream,"" Johann Hari's journalistic history of the war on drugs. Holiday was a particular obsession of Harry Anslinger (Garrett Hedlund), an anti-narcotics zealot at the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. In Hari's account, his hounding of her was motivated in no small part by racism, especially by his hatred of ""Strange Fruit,"" the harrowing anti-lynching tone poem that Holiday first recorded in 1939.There is real power in the story of a song so incendiary, so shockingly truthful, so likely to fan the flames of an entire civil rights movement that the American government sees it as a threat that must be stopped. And while that is part of the narrative — exploring the legacy of the legendary jazz singer and her haunting, unflinching song ""Strange Fruit,"" about lynchings in the American South — it is a thread that is often lost among a portrait of Holiday's life and the world she inhabited.But it is not, for all that, entirely unwatchable. Daniels' strength as a director lies less in his taste for histrionics and provocation than in his skill at observing quieter moments. He is a great choreographer of bodies at rest and casual conversations. The best parts of ""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday"" take place in dressing rooms, hotel suites and backstage lounges, during an impromptu softball game or a stroll in Central Park. With her friends — notably Roslyn (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), Miss Freddy (Miss Lawrence) and Tallulah Bankhead (Natasha Lyonne) — Billie is witty, profane, generous and sometimes mean, but always something other than a victim or a symbol.For all that the film often lingers on uncomfortable imagery — with historical footage of Black victims of white violence and depictions of forceful sexual encounters — there is a real purpose to the presentation and cinematography. One remarkable single-shot sequence sees Holiday leave her tour bus and accidentally stumble upon the horrifying aftermath of a lynching. She breaks down in the victim's house, staggers into a backstage room where she prepares to shoot up before eventually being shepherded onto a stage, where she finally performs ""Strange Fruit"" in full. In that central moment, Daniels knows exactly what he has, the camera remaining firmly on Day's face across the entire song. If only the rest of the film was this clear and incisive in its vision.The film too often feels stilted and inert, jumping from incident to incident without really getting to the heart of Holiday herself. With an array of side-characters that drift in and out of the story, the film often feels more like a story about the world, the people, the forces around Holiday than Holiday herself. But even there, it cannot quite commit to the most interesting threads. For all its zig-zagging attention span and clunky dialogue, what ""The United States Vs. Billie Holiday"" does is an arresting central performance from American singer Andra Day. Her Holiday is complex, constantly battling all manner of horrors the world throws her way, sometimes charming, other times impossible. And as a performer herself, Day is commanding in the on-stage sequences, her husky tone perfectly suited to inhabiting Holiday's smoky vocals. In the title role, singer Andra Day inhabits Holiday with such intensity that she partially redeems the movie. But there is a major caveat: You will likely spend the whole running time wishing Day had been given a vehicle with more to say about Holiday than this one, the gist of which can be summed up as, ""That poor junkie sure could sing.""",'The United States Vs.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/09/privilege-and-power,9/16/2021,"For some of us in the world, the fight to belong somewhere in this vastly large, yet woefully vacant place has been relentless; hurled into an endlessly turbulent expedition, some of us have been fervently yearning for the sweet comfort of an accepting community. On the other hand, some of us have been privileged enough to be indoctrinated from birth into automatic social acceptance, power and prestige.Today, communities serve as security havens, framed as hundreds of outlets aiding people in making sense of their collective experiences. Community is culture, community is civilization, community is family — or rather, community is our identity. Moreover, the tangency of such a concept is seen to materialize itself in film, books and art that reflect back as well as represent these appropriate identities. But what begins to unfold once these communities and social institutions begin to collapse, or worse, become infiltrated?Without realizing it, perhaps, Billie Eilish has not only infiltrated but exploited the LGBTQIA+ community for her personal gain and fame.After releasing an intimate music video for her new release “Lost Cause” this past pride month, the 20-year-old pop singer turned cultural icon has received very minimal backlash over “queer-baiting”: a marketing ploy in which heterosexual celebrities falsely orchestrate fabricated same-sexual activity on mass-media platforms to instigate controversy.The music video depicts Eilish with a group of 6 other girls engaging in several intimate interactions such as kissing and reciprocating physical affection. However, although the video has garnered some criticism, it has yet to ascend to the magnitude of needed reprimand for devaluing and fetishizing queerness. Eilish’s video perpetuates a series of damaging stereotypes: degrading behavior that previous heterosexual artists have taken advantage of for years on end. Eilish has abused her commercial presence, not for the greater good of spreading awareness, education or supporting LGBTQIA+ initiatives and campaigns, but to catapult her into a wider realm of publicity through a measure of controversy off the backs of an already prejudiced community. Despite “Lost Cause” being released during pride month, the lyrics are completely void of any mentioning of queer love, self-acceptance or the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. Instead of bringing awareness to the queer community to normalize marginalized sexualities, Eilish selfishly exploited the community by displaying sexual ambiguity to appeal to her LGBTQIA+ fans and bring in a larger audience. Not only this, but she has generated lots of press through confusing the general public on her sexuality. Her actions are only made worse after realizing that Billie is involved in a relationship with Mathew Tyler Vorcec — a man who has faced ridicule for his openly homophobic comments. It seems as though the youthful artist does not seem to value the emotions of her queer fans nor the ethical offense that she has committed towards the community as a whole. Eilish has infiltrated the community, exploited it for personal gain and misguided a marginalized people that covet nothing more than authentic representation. Unfortunately, yet not surprising, the American singer has yet to receive any major criticism for her blatant exploitation of queer culture. But how can someone evade public retribution after exhibiting such derogatory actions? Simply, it is due to her place of privilege and power. When a group holds dominance, social superiority and systematic power over others, they can willingly control the narrative with which they can avoid criticism and paint other social groups as inferior or faulty. It seems as though Eilish’s whiteness and heterosexuality — two socially dominant characteristics — act as barriers that withstand negative social affiliation and condemnation. There stands a glaring flaw when Eilish’s privilege and power allows the singer  to misleadingly emulate and give an illusory perception of gay culture to a young, impressionable audience when certain artists of color still struggle with coming out. Moreover, Eilish’s actions are a direct reflection of the current exploitation of discriminated minorities by groups of higher power. In proving such, the young artist and rapper Lil Nas X was under immense heat for his recent single “Montero: Call Me by Your Name” where he had clips of explicit queer, sexual expressions. While certain critics claim that the song was banned because of religious innuendos, several other music videos and songs could be deemed blasphemous such as “God is a Woman” by Ariana Grande and “Judas” by Lady Gaga, both of which did not receive as bad of a reception as Lil Nas X’s video. It seems as though for the white artists, their privilege sheltered them from mass criticism. Accordingly, this delves into the greater generational dilemma of how bodies of power can take advantage of discriminated groups without facing consequences; this is a parasitic relationship where they feed off their backs and exploit them for further personal gain. In this situation, the white heterosexual woman stands towering over queer folk who are struggling to live an authentic life, living with often unaccepting parents and a system that has deemed their lives abnormal.In spite of these existing conditions, Eilish is here — reaping the benefits from embodying a minority group while escaping all the disgrace and complexities that accompany it. It is so easy for Eilish to get away with queer-baiting while those who are not fortunate to be guarded by privilege must face the harsh reality of hate speech or possible death over their actual identities. What Eilish can choose to live out in one day is someone’s eternal struggle until they die. Billie Eilish’s whiteness and supposed heterosexuality function as an overarching armor that resists life-altering criticism. Ultimately, bodies of power cannot simply continue to use, subjugate and ignore marginalized and underrepresented groups for fame and power. We must refuse to let this go on — enough is enough.Abdullah Marei is a junior studying psychology.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/10/asm-passes-legislation-intended-to-restore-shared-governance-for-uw-students-and-faculty,10/1/2021,"Enthusiastic clapping echoed throughout the hearing room, and even though representatives’ faces were partly hidden behind masks, smiling eyes could still be seen lighting up the room on Wednesday night. The Associated Students of Madison Student Council had just passed new legislation that will fight to fix the language in the Wisconsin State Legislature about shared governance, which guarantees students and faculty are involved in the decision making for campus policies.“It was good to have something to actually show for all the effort put in last year,” ASM Chair Adrian Lampron said Wednesday, after the council met in person for the first time since the pandemic began. The vote passed with 21 members in favor and only one member against the legislation. However, this is “ideally the bare minimum,” said Legislative Affairs Chair Muralidharan Govindarajan, who was responsible for starting the legislation in April.Now that the legislation has passed, ASM will proceed by contacting state legislators about organizing a hearing and pitching their case to bring back the language in state statute 36.09(5), which was changed six years ago and removed the voice UW students had to make decisions in campus wide policies.In 2015, Governor Scott Walker passed an act that would change this statute from allowing students “primary responsibility for the formulation and review of policies” to having “primary responsibility for advising the Chancellor.”The decision to change the language in the state statute took UW students “from active participants to suddenly this subordinate role to the Chancellor,” said ASM Press Office Director Tyler Katzenberger. “It’s highly important making sure student voices [are] heard, and student opinions are reflected in campus policies.”Although ASM has attempted to regain the voice and power for UW students by passing this legislation practically unanimously, UW students and faculty still won’t be able to hold any real power in campus decisions until they set up a meeting with legislators, and the statute is changed on a state level. ASM also discussed other issues to tackle throughout the year, such as fossil fuel divestment in the Sustainability Committee and advocacy for more mental health services and sexual abuse prevention in the Equity and Inclusion Committee.For many UW-Madison students and ASM members, like Govindarajan, passing this legislation wasn’t just a step in the right direction toward shared governance for UW-Madison students — it was also an opportunity to advocate for shared governance for students in other institutions throughout the state as well.“I’m happy that this is going in the direction that I want it, and students will finally get the voice that they lost six years ago,” Govindarajan said. “But we’re hoping to get that hearing, and we’re hoping to use that to get some momentum on this.”","ASM passes legislation intended to restore shared governance for UW students, faculty",Wisconsin,Neutral,Neutral,0,Briefly Mentioned,Report
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2021/11/uw-madison-community-reacts-to-rep-vos-letter-criticizing-required-violence-prevention-course,11/30/2021,"University of Wisconsin-Madison community members expressed concerns with a letter sent from Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly Robin Vos to Chancellor Rebecca Blank earlier this month accusing the university of “turning its back on the values of intellectual diversity” due to the inclusion of Critical Race Theory in the curriculum of a online prevention education course for graduate students. In his letter, Speaker Vos emphasized that it is “unacceptable” that the university requires graduate students to take a class that he believes “instills the university’s negative opinion of white students and the idea that students should feel guilty simply because of their race.”Jack Phillips, a graduate student and member of both the Associated Students of Madison (ASM) and the Teaching Assistants Association (TAA), who has participated in the UHS course described their concerns with Vos’ letter and his portrayal of the course. “I did go back and look at what I could from the course to refresh my memory,” Phillip said. “The course that I took covers violence prevention strategies, support structures for victims of violence and abuse, and mechanisms for reporting violence.” Phillips emphasized that they never felt uncomfortable participating in the course and that there was no mention of the phrases “Critical Race Theory” or “Critical Race Feminism” when they referred back. The course in reference is a two hour online webinar called “Graduate and Professional Students Preventing and Responding to Sexual and Relationship Violence,” which incoming graduate students are required to take in order to enroll in classes. University Health Services (UHS) administers the course and said that the program aims to enhance students understanding of sexual assult and harrasment, effective prevention strategies, available campus resources and victim rights. “I’ve never heard of anyone with reservations about this course nor feelings of alienation from it,” Phillips said, noting that graduate students and workers are more concerned about other issues facing the community than Speaker Vos' letter.The violence prevention course, as reported by the Wisconsin State Journal, references how privilege can feed institutional power that can create dangerous, racist structures, stating that Critical Race Theory can help students understand “how a regime of white supremacy and its subordination of people of color have been created and maintained in America.”“If Speaker Vos wishes to support graduate students, he should propose adequately funding public education and support the current effort of several lawmakers to repeal Act 55, which killed shared governance at UW-Madison,” Phillips continued. Ultimately, Phillips believes that Speaker Vos is attempting to cause “moral panic” around Critical Race Theory. “This moral panic is essentially genocide denial applied to centuries of slavery and its lasting impacts on our nation,” Phillips said, emphasizing that Critical Race Theory is often utilized in political agendas. “Rep. Vos is pushing an explicitly fascist talking point and wants to set the stage for a long, slow genocide of marginalized groups by eliminating reference to us in any education materials.” Describing the usage of Critical Race Theory in Vos’ political rhetoric as “astroturfed,” Phillips emphasized their concern about potential violence on-campus and in the greater Madison area community as educational institutions such as school boards, for example, have been a point of tension with far-right militias due to policy and curriculum decisions around the country.“By stoking outrage over UW-Madison’s violence prevention initiative with this language, Vos is essentially inviting militias to the UW campus,” said Phillips. In response to Speaker Vos’ letter, ASM also reiterated support for the university’s use of the violence prevention initiative.“ASM stands behind UW-Madison’s ‘Graduate and Professional Students Preventing and Responding to Sexual and Relationship Violence’ education webinar … we defend the program’s race-conscious content, as marginalized individuals and groups disproportionately experience sexual and relationship violence,” the Nov. 22 statement reads.Blank, who Speaker Vos’ letter was directed toward, has yet to publicly comment or release a statement.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/02/the-color-purple-brings-talent-to-madison-on-national-tour,2/26/2020,"“The Color Purple” opened at Madison’s Overture Center on Feb. 18, starting an eight performance run set to end on the 23rd. The show is a time-tested and breathtaking foray into the issues of abuse, redemption and love and this national tour cast stays true to those themes. The incredible show is one of a few different adaptations stemming from Alice Walker’s original 1982 book. Steven Spielberg adapted it into a movie starring Whoopi Goldberg, Danny Glover and Oprah Winfrey in 1985, upon which the 2005 Broadway musical was based, garnering 11 Tony nominations. In 2015, it was announced that the London production would be staged on Broadway with Cynthia Erivo in the main role of Celie along with Jennifer Hudson and “Orange Is the New Black’s” Danielle Brooks. The Revival was nominated for four Tonys, winning two. The show opens with the full cast standing on the bare, simplistic, four level stage, with two of the show’s main characters, Celie (played incredibly by Mariah Lyttle) and Nettie (Nashka Derosiers), singing a playful and optimistic song that is reminiscent of playground ditties, “Opening / Mysterious Ways.” The only set pieces used are a few straw baskets and a variety of simple wooden chairs that hang on the back wall between scenes. This visually simplistic design gives a similar tone to Walker’s book, which tells its heartbreaking story entirely by way of letters.Other elements of the original book come through very clearly in the musical, especially considering the book is nearly 40 years old. The lyrics for the musical often echo Celie’s letters in the book by beginning a song with “Dear God,” but the portion of the book that is most mirrored in the musical comes in the show’s final number, “The Color Purple (Reprise).” The song begins with the same line that begins the final letter in the book, and ends with almost the exact same line as the book: “I don’t think us feel old at all. I think this is the youngest us ever felt. Amen.” The story is a complicated narrative involving love and heartbreak as well as other topics that aren’t often addressed in mainstream media such as physical and sexual abuse. All of the actresses who have played Celie, from Goldberg in the film, LaChanze in the 2005 musical, Erivo in the 2016 revival, and now Lyttle in the national tour, have needed to portray an incredibly wide range of emotions. She suffers abuse from her husband, heartbreak from the woman she falls in love with, intense anger towards her husband for hiding letters from her sister and finally forgiveness for those that have wronged her. Lyttle beautifully represented all of these emotions. The one thing I felt diminished Lyttle’s performance was the sound levels on some of her show-stopping songs. You could see her passion on stage, but I felt the sound of her voice didn’t hit the audience as strongly as it could’ve. Other actors also had incredibly passionate performances, most notably Chédra Arielle as Sofia and Sandie Lee as Shug Avery. What caught my ear the most was their spectacular ability to riff and make awe-inspiring vocal runs to embellish whatever note or line they were singing. Almost all of the characters did this to an extent, but I thought Arielle and Lee blew the house down in this department. Their talent gave the show a fresh feeling, allowing the audience to feel like this show was totally different from the last performance.The music felt very convincing due to the obvious blues, jazz and gospel influences infused in its music, written by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis and Stephen Bray. Considering the setting of the show, the cultural struggles it represents and the themes it discusses, it makes perfect sense that the show would utilize specific musical traditions to evoke the feelings of despair from the blues, faith from gospel and hope from jazz. Bluesy songs like “Big Dog” and “Push da Button” feel like they were pulled straight from the Mississippi Delta, and songs like “Hell No!” and “Brown Betty” sample gospel music with their repeated use of call and response. By using elements of different kinds of historically African-American music, the writers allow the audience to reside in a very believable musical landscapeOne of the lighter and most entertaining elements of the show were the Church Ladies, played by Elizabeth Adabale, Parris Lewis and Shelby A. Sykes. In the first act, the three women would come on stage between every few scenes and sing a short, humorous song (“That Fine Mister,” “A Tree Named Sophia”) recapping a previous scene or previewing the next. Adabale, Lewis and Sykes were masterful with their rhythm locked tightly together, providing comic relief to the often dark and heavy show. In a word, this show is phenomenal. In its explorations of the emotional topics embedded in the original book, the show takes the entire audience on a journey that is impossible to stop thinking about.",'The Color Purple' brings talent to Madison on national tour,Wisconsin,Neutral,Pro-Victim,0,Briefly Mentioned,Report
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/04/when-youre-not-safer-at-home-how-city-state-services-are-supporting-domestic-abuse-victims-during-quarantine,4/30/2020,"Similar to a rapidly spreading infection, data suggests domestic abuse is proliferating around the world in conditions created by the coronavirus pandemic.Across the globe, as more and more individuals are quarantined at home with state-mandated ""shelter-in-place"" orders, there’s been a surge in cases of domestic abuse calls, the New York Times reported.Along with Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Seattle, who have publicly stated they are seeing increases in domestic violence allegations, Shannon Barry, Executive Director of Domestic Abuse Intervention Services, anticipates the same for Madison.In addition to its domestic violence shelter and 24-hour helpline, DAIS provides legal advocacy, emergency safety planning, support groups, children’s programming and primary prevention and education programs for the Madison area.Keeping Operations Going During COVID-19But approximately six weeks before the end of 2019, United Way of Dane County informed Barry they were pulling their investments in DAIS’ programs, in what amounted to almost $200,000 a year, after 42 years. “[It] was a huge blow for the organization and one that we weren’t really anticipating,” Barry said. “We were going to step up and do what we could do to fundraise to fill that gap, but the pandemic has really limited the intensive fundraising that we need to do.”With the spread of COVID-19, DAIS had to close their business office and postpone their biggest fundraiser of the year, facing a potentially significant revenue shortfall.Fortunately, in late March, they received a $58,000 grant in emergency shelter funding from Dane County, along with a grant from the Boys and Girls Club, to maintain services during the pandemic.“DAIS is an invaluable organization in our community, and we are committed to making sure those experiencing domestic abuse continue to have access to essential resources, especially during this challenging time,” Dane County Executive Joe Parisi said.The county’s grant will help ensure the continued operations of Dane County’s only shelter for domestic violence victims as well as the DAIS’ helpline, a service Barry said is more important now than previously. “We anticipate that we are going to see more people contacting us, even if the relationship hadn't escalated previously to physical abuse,” Barry said. Additionally, Barry said she also expects a higher volume of domestic abuse calls to law enforcement. Domestic Violence Calls and the Potential Toll of Economic StressSince Gov. Tony Evers’ implemented Wisconsin’s “Safer-at-Home” order on March 25, Madison Police Department has had an average of 8.75 domestic violence calls a day — a slight 4 percent increase from before the order was in place.The order is now set to continue until May 26 — a prolongation heavily contested by state Republicans and the reason for protests across the state. But it also raises concern longer movement limits will lead to even more cases of intimate partner violence. “The irony is the Governor's executive order is called ‘Safer-at-Home’ and for many people home is the least safe place,” Barry said. “DAIS will continue to be available during this time and when [the] safer at home orders are lifted. We are prepared and ready to respond.”Barry added everyone knows someone who's been affected by intimate partner violence — just not everyone discloses that information.In some cities, domestic abuse reports are actually decreasing, causing even more concern victims are unable to alert authorities from state officials.""We're having 10 fewer crime reports each day for instances of domestic violence,"" Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore told ABC News. ""That's going in the wrong direction with what we believe is actually happening behind closed doors.""Data shows when families or couples experience economic stress, rates of domestic violence increase.DAIS saw this trend during the 2008 economic recession. Between 2008 and 2009, there was a 108 percent increase in the number of people contacting them seeking shelter services. They expect to see it again during the coronavirus pandemic too.“Now, we have a situation where people are struggling financially,” Barry said. “There's a lot of fear and anxiety within our community about this illness, and, on top of that, you have…a whole other layer of stress as families have [everyone] home together at once.”Despite the potential for increased domestic abuse rates, state efforts remain to help mitigate some of the adverse effects of the pandemic for victims of abuse.Safe at Home: The Significance of a Protective State ProgramSafe at Home, a program established by state law in 2017 and housed within the Department of Justice, works with local advocacy agencies, like DAIS, to provide address confidentiality for abuse victims. The program is available to those who have experienced any kind of abuse — such as trafficking, domestic abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse and stalking — or certify they are in fear of their physical safety. The DOJ acts as a repository of their actual address, issuing a substitute one used for all intents and purposes and then forwards mail to each participant’s actual household.With lots of important documents being sent in the mail during the pandemic, Safe at Home — not to be confused with the Governor’s executive order “Safer-at-Home” — is focused on maintaining the continuity of the program, according to program director Erin Welsh. The program has received an increased volume of calls from individuals looking to get additional information on the Governor's order due to the similarity in the name.Welsh said not only is she able to point those callers toward reliable sources, but she also uses the opportunity to inform them on the Safe at Home program itself.“We want to connect with local advocacy agencies to make sure they can provide continued services and continue to help folks enroll in the program,” Welsh said. “It's [also] really important to be able to continue to forward mail to our current participants. Just because our operations may be somewhat limited and folks might be working from home doesn't mean our services are any less important.”If anything, receiving physical mail is more significant now than it’s been the past several years — especially with the pandemic coinciding with a historic election cycle.Enrolling in the Safe at Home program allows participants to become a confidential voter, meaning they aren’t required to disclose their address when registering or voting. But, in order to do so, they need a confidential elector affidavit and they must do it in person, posing a safety issue during the pandemic.Welsh spent the past month prioritizing election materials, making sure all affidavits were updated and filed with their respective clerks in a timely manner. “I think, like anyone else, folks scrambled at the last minute to figure out how [they] can vote safely,” Welsh said. “And that means not just in light of COVID, but other security needs for our participants.”Welsh also forwards on tax forms, unemployment checks, stimulus checks and kids’ school materials.“We're responsible for that information,” she added. “It's just figuring it out and maintaining the level of service our participants need to stay safe and continue to function the best they can as they figure this out themselves.”At the end of the day, Welsh said both Safe at Home and local advocacy agencies have the same goal: getting the message out that services are still available to those who need them. Anyone in need of assistance or services can call DAIS’ helpline at (608) 251-4445. Those with less crisis-based issues can email the helpline at crisisline@abuseintervention.org.","When you’re not ‘safer at home’: How city, state services are supporting domestic abuse victims during quarantine",Wisconsin,Liberal,Pro-Victim,0,Central,Report
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2020/11/we-asked-uw-students-what-does-this-election-mean-to-you,11/5/2020,"Four years ago, before most UW-Madison students were even able to vote, an election fundamentally changed the way our generation views politics. On Tuesday, many of those students cast their first ballots in a contest where they saw a stark difference between two incompatible versions of America. The Daily Cardinal took to the streets to find out what specific issues make this election meaningful for students here at UW-Madison. After battleground swing state of Wisconsin fell red in 2016 primarily due to the surge of voting from blue-collar rural Wisconsin, according to the New York Times, the youth vote in Madison and Milwaukee, with other blue upticks in Eau Claire, La Crosse and Green Bay, seem to have been a driving cause in state’s Democratic flip. As the results of that contest remain unclear — with some states yet to announce a winner and the president’s twitter account casting doubt on the integrity of the election — we took a look through the eyes of UW-Madison current and past students at what hangs in the balance.How do you feel about President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden as candidates? “For years, the notion of holding my nose while I vote for the lesser of two evils is tempered in this election because our current President [and] his supporters -including Republican representatives at all levels- have exemplified evil in unprecedented ways,” said Brian Bedford, UW Odyssey class of 1974. Rose Kelleher, a sophomore at UW-Madison, was passionate about this election because of the insensitivity that President Donald Trump has shown in the past four years. “I am voting in this election because I think that this country needs real leadership which has not been shown in the last four years of Trump’s term,” said Kelleher. “It really makes me sick to my stomach that the president currently in office is blatantly racist, homophobic and a sexual offender. Every time I hear Trump speak, I am astounded at the lack of thought put into his arbitrary statements. I think much of the country is tired of listening to his bullsh**, and is ready for some real change to occur in our country, which is why I voted for Joe Biden.” The harsh reality of a democratic leaning campus, along with the political climate that surrounds a Trump presidency, means that many conservative-leaning students are weary of voicing their political views in fear of retaliation from their peers. “From the left side, there has been an aggressive mindset where if you’re white you are racist, and if you say you’re not, you are very racist. Basically anyone who doesn’t agree with them is 'canceled' into today’s world,” junior Dawson Bauer said. “This has been shown time and time again in these past months especially in UW students. I guarantee every UW student has seen daily posts on social media that all have the same message: if you vote for Trump, we can’t be friends because you are a terrible person and you are a racist.”In addition to questioning President Trump’s leadership, it is evident that many youth voters are concerned with how the future president will handle the racial tension in our country. “As a woman and person of color, I strongly believe this election will have a long lasting impact on my community and the course of my future,” said Karen Hayes, a senior at UW-Madison. “Electing a more competent leader is only the beginning, but it is a necessary step that I hope our country [took].” Hersh Pareek, a sophomore at UW-Madison, argued that, no matter who wins this election, the two-party system limits the political choice necessary to make change for marginalized communities.“I think voting is really important, especially for the 2020 election,” Pareek said. “But at the same time, I don’t want to pressure people of color or indigenous people to vote for Biden because I know both parties won’t be able to solve systemic racism. While I think voting is really important, I don’t think indigenous people and people of color should be obligated to vote under a two-party system that will always continue to oppress them.”Bauer believes that the silent Republican “majority,” in Madison specifically, is due to the controversy surrounding President Trump as a candidate. “The name calling, online bullying and being an outcast to your community, especially in minority ones, has created the silent Trump voter such as myself,” Bauer said. “I personally am an independent voter and would have supported a better Democratic nominee easily — such Andrew Yang — but I think Trump is the lesser evil from the two candidates. But I feel like I can’t post anything on social media about my political beliefs without being ‘canceled’, losing friends and ruining my social life just because I don’t support Biden.” Yet, other students still believe since “polarizing issues” such as abortion and reproductive rights are on the line, students much consider those around them and think about the negative ramifications that surround their choice for president. “This election is a battle between progress and suppression, of autonomy and support, versus disruption, chaos and lies,” said Brooke Wilczewski, a junior at UW-Madison. “While neither candidate is arguably a lot of people’s first choice, this coming candidate will determine who our nation is as a country for generations to come. It is important that we all take action and fight for all people. Even if such decisions don’t affect you personally, think about all of those in your inner circle that it does.”What specific political issues swayed your vote in this election? According to Mathew Mitnick, Associated Students of Madison Chair, this election is about more than choosing a new president: It’s about voting to combat climate change, defund and abolish the police, ensure affordable housing and democracy itself, amongst other issues. “The current administration has shown that they don’t know how to uphold the freedoms that citizens are granted and abuse their power to better their own business,” said Ava Kaminski, current fellow for the Biden campaign in Madison. “They’re not for the people, they’re for themselves and 45 does not deserve to hold that seat anymore. People’s rights and livelihoods are up for grabs in this election, and I couldn’t just stand by and watch while we were fighting for our democracy.” Bauer cited the left for creating the racial tension in our country, indicating democratic media outlets as the culprits. “They are the people who would immediately report on every single shooting of a black person without knowing all of the facts which created the mob mentality of rioting,” Bauer said. “It was a month before it was shown that George Floyd was on enough fentanyl to kill an average person. Now this isn’t an excuse or saying that I or people who voted for Trump thought that his death was okay. But I didn’t want to jump to conclusions before I knew all the facts. The media these days don’t care about the facts but instead want to support this rioting and then blame it on Trump.” Climate change and racial injustice are central for this election to Pareek and many others. Pareek said that a Biden White House will not solve systematic racism, but will put forth policies that aim to help minorities and underrepresented people. “For me, this election is the harbinger to another civil war,” Bedford said. “From my lens as a 61-year-old, Black, father of five wonderful children, including four adults; a long-time family advocate, educator and activist, I see any illusion of a democracy in great peril.” What changes do you hope to see in our democracy after this election? Many students at UW-Madison were outraged by the suppressive voter laws in the state of Wisconsin, according to Mitnick. By having to obtain a separate, government-issued Voter ID, some students felt that their voices were being suppressed, causing many of them to fight harder for their voice to be heard. “I would also like to see UW-Madison make a greater commitment to voting. ASM unanimously passed legislation to cancel synchronous classes on Election Day,” said Bedford. “This request has not been met. UW's failure to implement this proposal further serves as another voter suppression tactic. We need to make it as easy as possible for students to vote!""Bedford also explained that the 2020 presidential election is a huge opportunity to expose systemic issues and change for the better.“I believe that our whole political system has been flawed and broken since the birth of this nation,” Bedford said. “Since its inception, our political model was designed to keep mostly privileged white men in power, the same men that are puppets to the special interests that have polluted our political system with dirty money. This election will ignite the fuse that will blow away the false veneer that has hidden the hypocrisies that this nation was founded on.”Bauer posed the question of minorities being the ones who have suffered the most at the hands of a democratic government. “I think the real people who have suffered the most from the left are the minorities. Most cities have been under democratic control for decades, and those are where the real racial issues still are today,” Bauer said. “The right side is tired of all of the Democratic hate and empty promises. There have been more minorities to vote for Trump this year than his last election. That fact alone shows that the left’s false promises and constant bullying are starting to push people away, yet there is still a fear about letting it be known you don’t support the Democrats in this election.”Professors here at UW-Madison have been incredibly vocal about the issue of political polarization in the United States. According to John Zumbrunnen, political science professor at UW-Madison, the country is currently in a time of intense partisan polarization and we have many important norms that have shaped U.S. politics overturned or ignored. “The current state of the world is dependent on this upcoming election,” said Jonah Rubinitz, junior at UW-Madison. “I know there are a ton of young voters out there who think that their vote does not make a difference, when it's the most important demographic of the election. 2020 has been a terrible year for many people, and I hope that this election will change the state of the world for the better.” ",We asked UW students: What does this election mean to you?,Wisconsin,Neutral,Neutral,0,Briefly Mentioned,Report
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2019/10/fights-at-lincoln-hills-involve-26-inmates,10/16/2019,"A report from the Lincoln Hills School for Boys detailed the events of five altercations involving 26 inmates which occurred over a two-day period at the end of September. The report shows evidence that a guard was choked by one of the inmates, who is now facing charges for the incident, and other guards sustained knee, shoulder and nose injuries. At one point, five inmates climbed into the ceiling area and broke lights. Lincoln Hills has experienced continued controversy over multiple allegations of physical and sexual abuse, resulting in lawsuits from inmates to the facility’s officers and administration. Gov. Tony Evers’ administration passed a law requiring the closure of Lincoln Hills by 2021. Teresa Abreu, a court-ordered monitor who regularly visits Lincoln Hills, went to the facility about a week before the incident unfolded, noting the conditions were improving. ""Youth attitudes overall were very good during this site visit. As a result of the progress made, it is clearly evident that these changes are having a positive impact on the overall atmosphere and culture of the facility,"" Abreu claimed.In the past month, due to court mandated changes, Lincoln Hills has seen increased staff from adult prisons all over the state to support the facilities’ needs. Additional changes include the punishment procedures, which no longer allow inmates to be placed into solitary confinement for extended periods of time. Plans also ensure officers will receive additional training, and inmates will receive more programming. state news writer",Fights at Lincoln Hills involve 26 inmates,Wisconsin,Neutral,Neutral,0,Briefly Mentioned,Report
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/03/high-schoolers-impress-in-the-risky-spring-awakening,3/5/2018,"Express Yourself! put on its final production of “Spring Awakening” on Saturday night at the Bartell Theater after performing around Wisconsin since the beginning of November.“Spring Awakening” is a rock musical based on Frank Wedekind’s late 19th-century play of the same name — it proves that teen angst knows no time period. The musical was conceived in the 90s and hit Broadway in 2006 where it won eight Tony Awards, but more importantly, shone a red-hot, sexually-charged spotlight on the previously pristine Broadway stage.The show’s classical German attire clashes beautifully with the musical’s intense content including suicide, parental abuse, abortion and more, making the performance by Express Yourself!’s mostly high school-aged cast all the more impressive. There were moments so sweet I audibly whimpered and times I realized I was tensing my muscles and holding my breath.The musical opens with Wendla Bergmann (Isabel Garlough-Shah) grappling with the emotions of her burgeoning sexuality, finding no help from her mother despite her pleads to learn where babies come from. Wendla’s frustration finds company with the other young women in town, which they voice in the song “Mama Who Bore Me (Reprise).” Enter Melchoir Gabor (Zachariah Sterner), a well-read radical fed up with the intellectual confines his professor puts on him and his classmates — including Wendla’s personal, yet problematic sexual awakening.The simple staging allowed each scene to exist in its purest form without the distraction of an elaborate set. The ever-present symbol of a leafy tree cast in light against the black curtain contextualized quieter, less intense scenes and faded to the background during chaotic moments.The dynamic between the adults and teens in the town follows a Charlie Brown-like structure: the adults were played by the same three actors, spouting uninspired messages of shame and disappointment at the youth, while the teens vocalize their inner turmoil to heavy guitar beats. Fueled by anxiety and most afflicted by the adult shaming, Moritz Stiefel (played by understudy Austin Brummett) makes a confidant out of Melchoir when he tells him about the womanly legs that visit him in his dreams each night to his horror. This is seconded only by his fear of academic failure. Melchoir promises to divulge his sexual expertise to Moritz in essay form — with pictures, though.Traditional gender roles are perhaps the only social boundaries the musical doesn’t push: the male characters lament over their sexual frustrations and the female characters fantasize about which boy in town might be their someday-hubby.Director Jenna Carol made the risky choice to cast the actors as close to their character’s ages as possible in order to give them more relatability. “Wise beyond their years” doesn’t begin to cover the maturity the cast approached the show with. Their voices paled slightly during quieter melodies, but their group harmonies and beltier moments raised both energy and goosebumps.The whole show is steeped in angst, but the act two number “Totally Fucked” was a peak both musically and emotionally. During this number, the whole cast passionately belted expletives prompting cheers from the audience. The song is an eruptive moment of pure pubescence in what is otherwise an unbelievably mature script. As an audience member, it’s tempting to join the cast in singing the flippant mockery of the adults with the perfectly teenaged lyrics: “blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.”The weight of shame grows heavier and heavier on the teens’ shoulders in act two with ultimately dire consequences for three of the main characters.The show left me with a lot to ponder about the pressure adults burden teenagers with, but it mainly serves as a cautionary tale for the lack of communication and abundance of shame society —both modern and late nineteenth century Germany — places on teenagers. From start to finish, the kids contend with the shame of failing in school, having sex outside of marriage (and liking it), masturbating, experiencing abuse and the shame of homosexuality, just to name a few. After having a horrifying realization of the reality of her situation, Wendla agonizes to her mama, “My God, why didn’t you tell me everything?”Following the cast’s immensely mature performances, they melted back into their teenage selves with gripping hugs and fat tears streaming down their faces. Watching this family-like cast share their last performance of a play unlike any other they’ll likely perform in as teens rivaled the emotional punch of a well done coming-of-age movie.In a phone interview, lead Isa Garlough-Shah, who portrayed Wendla, said being part of this production was unlike any other she’s ever acted in. It required intense trust-building among the cast, especially between herself and her partner Zachariah Sterner.Although the content of Spring Awakening feels anything but safe or comfortable, after the bows Director Jenna Carol said this production was a safe space for the actors at a time when it’s hard to say the same about their high schools.",High schoolers impress in the risky ‘Spring Awakening’,Wisconsin,Neutral,Neutral,0,Briefly Mentioned,Report
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/08/your-primer-for-tuesdays-statewide-primaries,8/13/2018,"In one of the most anticipated primary elections in recent years, Wisconsinites will head to the polls Tuesday to select their party’s nominees for a swath of key races coming in the general election.Seen as a major battleground in what will likely be a decisive midterm election, the state’s voters will decide who will make the ballot for governor, U.S. Senate and lieutenant governor, as well as several district-based legislative races, both state and federal.Democratic primary for governorPerhaps the most high-profile of them all is the contentious battle to decide which Democrat will face sitting Gov. Scott Walker.With a level of name recognition and financial backing none of his opponents could hope to rival, Walker’s run for a third term may actually be his toughest yet.The governor has always been a divisive figure in the state, but some recent polls show he might be more vulnerable than in the past.Recent polls from Emerson College and Marist show Walker losing to current Democratic frontrunner and state superintendent Tony Evers, while pollsters at Wisconsin’s own Marquette University give Walker the edge.“The Republicans have made gains in Wisconsin,” said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. “But it may be difficult for the GOP to make a convincing case in 2018.”Far and away the most well known candidate in the race thanks to years in statewide office, 31 percent of respondents in the Marquette poll prefered Evers, while no other candidate managed to reach double digits.Relatively united on policy issues, like bolstering healthcare, education and infrastructure spending, other Democrats have struggled to make themselves known to the public, while Evers has used his background in education to make his case.“As a member of the Board of Regents, Tony has seen firsthand the damage Scott Walker has inflicted on higher education in Wisconsin,” Maggie Gau, Evers’ campaign manager, told the Daily Cardinal. “He’s cut more from our UW System than almost any other governor in the country. When other states began reinvesting in higher education, Wisconsin chose not to and it’s resulted in fewer classes and quality educators for our kids.”Of Evers’ seven opponents, former state Rep. Kelda Roys, state firefighters’ union head Mahlon Mitchell and former party chairman Matt Flynn are seen as the most viable competitors.Roys, the former director of NARAL Pro-Choice Wisconsin, is backed by women’s groups including Emily’s List and has been a successful fundraiser.“Kelda Roys is entering the final stretch of this campaign with the resources, message, and momentum needed to win,” Roys campaign spokesperson Brian Evans said in a statement. “If Democrats want a candidate who can take on and take down Scott Walker, they must vote for Kelda Roys.”Mitchell, age 41, is seen by some as another young, exciting alternative along with 39-year-old Roys.With the backing of many of the state’s labor organizations, some see Mitchell as the candidate to challenge Walker on the effects of his 2011 Act 10 law, which disempowered most unions from collectively bargaining for wages and benefits.Flynn has proven to be a divisive candidate — despite a strong foundation of support within the party, he has received significant backlash for his role as a lawyer for the Milwaukee Archdiocese during a major child sexual abuse scandal.The other candidates, who many see as lacking the resources and support to make a run for the nomination, include progressive activist Mike McCabe, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin, state Sen. Kathleen Vinehout, D-Alma, as well as lawyer and political newcomer Josh Pade.Republican primary for SenateAs national Republicans hope to expand their slim, single vote majority in the U.S. Senate, the party has their eyes on incumbent Democrats up for reelection in states won by President Donald Trump.Near the top of many Republicans list is U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has had more money spent against her than any other Democratic incumbent.The state party has backed state Sen. Leah Vukmir, who has garnered big name endorsements from the likes of House Speaker Paul Ryan, former national party chairman Reince Priebus and even hired Gov. Scott Walker’s son, Alex, as an aide.The problem? Vukmir still may not win.The Brookfield Republican is neck and neck with Kevin Nicholson, a marine veteran and businessman, who has been able to court some influential conservative donors into financing his primary stint.Richard Uihlein, an Illinois businessman and Republican megadonor, has already dropped nearly $8 million in contributions and ads to either support Nicholson or oppose Vukmir.Both have not been without controversy, however, as Vukmir has faced backlash for calling Trump, who remains extremely popular among the Republican rank-and-file, “offensive to everyone” in 2016. She later walked back that claim and affirmed support for her party’s president in an ad.Nicholson, a former registered Democrat, faced criticism from Republicans for his former ties to their opponents, but said he drifted from the party long ago.Both candidates heavily praised the president in their last primary debate; Nicholson said Trump has done “good work, and we should applaud him for it,” while Vukmir declared he is “standing for our country,""While the two Republicans remain in a dead heat, Baldwin has held a strong lead against both in the polls, defeating Vukmir by 17 points and Nicholson by 15 points.Republicans hope that with the primary will come the unity needed to flip the state’s key senate seat.Democratic primary for lieutenant governorAlong with Gov. Scott Walker, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch is running unopposed in the Republican primary, and will be up for reelection as a part of the party’s gubernatorial ticket.On the other side, two Democrats are duking it out to pair up with whoever comes out on top of their party’s primary for governor.Mandela Barnes, a former state legislator, has emphasized outlining a progressive legislative agenda as the key to inspiring voters in November.""We have to stand up and run for something,"" Barnes said in his speech at the Democratic Convention in Oshkosh. ""We have to talk about who we are as Democrats. We have to talk about our plan to expand opportunity across this entire state.""Barnes, a 31-year-old from Milwaukee, lost a 2016 primary bid for state Senate to current state Sen. Lena Taylor, D-Milwaukee.His opponent is Kurt Kober, a Sheboygan businessman who recently moved back to Wisconsin after a decade of living out of state.Kober, like many Democrats, sees undoing Walker’s impact on the state as central to any party agenda.""Imagine if we supported public education. Imagine if we supported a spirit of entrepreneurship in our state. Imagine if we once again embraced the Wisconsin Idea,” he said.With control of Congress and a series of key state policy battles hanging in the balance, Wisconsin’s primary elections will set up more than a few races to watch in November.",Your primer for Tuesday’s statewide primaries,Wisconsin,Neutral,Neutral,0,Briefly Mentioned,Report
https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/10/rupi-kaurs-the-sun-and-her-flowers-is-a-recipe-for-life,10/1/2018,"In light of Rupi Kaur’s appearance at UW-Madison, I thought this was the perfect time to explore her newest collection, “the sun and her flowers.” An opportunity to dive into the world of poetry was not going to be passed up.Her debut collection “milk and honey” liberated poetry from the archaism of convoluted subjects and strict meter. The fluidity of her style transforms the metaphors that encapsulate the struggle of life.After self-publishing “milk and honey,” Kaur signed a two-book deal with publishing company Simon and Schuster. The long-awaited pseudo-sequel came Oct. 3, 2017. It is designed to be a more grown-up version that dives deeper into the complexity of human emotion.“the sun and her flowers” touches on the various forms of love: “A vibrant and transcendent journey about growth and healing. Ancestry and honoring one’s roots. Expatriation and rising up to find a home within yourself.”The themes center around love and loss, trauma and abuse, healing, femininity and the body. Certain topics of female infanticide, immigration and borders bring about the realization for Kaur’s mission: equality and love for all genders, races and backgrounds.The origination for this titular collection arose from Kaur’s thought process on a difficult breakup. She disclosed, “We are all our own suns and flowers are the experiences and the people we got through in our entire lifetime, so the sun and her flowers.”The stylization is similar to “milk and honey” by reflection of Kaur’s culture. This is done through the inclusion of Gurmukhi script, the use of only lower-case letters. She purposefully abstains from traditional punctuation to powerfully affirm each line.There are a combination of short poems with longer narratives when recounting issues such as her parents’ broken English and its beauty or self-reclamation after sexual abuse. Her poems often lack titles and distinct boundaries between each piece; they can either be read as sequences or individually. The fluidity is an organic creation of poetry that is distinct from the formal constraints of the genre.Originally, “the sun and her flowers” was intended to be a collection detailing the intricacies of unhealthy relationships and how toxic love distorts our view of the world. Due to the recent climate, Kaur was pulled to write about the political implications of diaspora and immigration. There is an evident shift from the repetition of love poems and healing shown in “milk and honey” to a distressed commentary on racial issues.The book is split into five sections, designed to reflect the life cycle of flowers: “wilting,” “falling,” “rooting,” “rising” and “blooming.” Each section focuses on one thematic aspect that overarches the main message: a celebration of love in all its forms. Similar to the last collection, there are sketches and illustrations that are relevant to each flower cycle.The first section, “wilting,” touches on the pervading distress of lost love and the struggle of waking up in bed alone. This is not simply lamentation of a breakup, but the affirmation of needing self-love. It demonstrates the early stages of a breakup and people getting in touch with their new selves.In the poem “what love looks like,” she questions the definition of love and our unhealthy obsession with solely romantic affection. This is not a pitiful sob story but rather a candid expression of what it should be like. She writes, “i think love starts here/ everything else is just desire and projection.” Love is an act of giving: the love of selflessly hard-working parents or the fading love of a distant friend.The arduous journey toward self-acceptance is not simplified or watered down, and the struggles of depression are disturbingly depicted. For example, “what draws you to her/ tell me what you like/ so I can practice” exposes a self-flagellating psyche. However, it’s crucial to note there is a defiant refusal to find validation in a lover’s approval.The next section, “falling,” is the downfall of the first part with the overwhelming emotions of loneliness and sorrow. The focus is around the depressive feelings after a loss of an important relationship — that dark cloud which feels heavy.The poem “depression is a shadow living in me” shows the evocation of dejection and utter hopelessness. It demonstrates the vivid imagery of a person trapped within their own thoughts.“rooting” is the third section and shows a shift in its exploration of topics like female infanticide and immigration. This is the process of regaining strength and self-worth in life. The contemplation of life at its fullest and rumination. The soul is able to re-energize and begin again.Rather than homogenize these experiences into collective trauma, Kaur focuses on the intimate moments of her mother’s longing for her native Punjab. This nuanced exploration of faces is shown through her guilt about her parents’ sacrifices and the desire to understand their cultural history, to have “pried their silence apart like a closed envelope.” This is not just grief, but a fierce pride of racial identity: “it is a blessing/ to be the colour of the earth.”There is a demand for more representation in literature which is emphasized by her unapologetic poetic style that takes up space: “to be mouthy/ get as loud as we need/ to be heard.”The fourth cycle is entitled “rising.” This is the transition into a more positive note after the sensation of being at rock bottom. It’s taking action and ascending from the lowest level. She notes this in the section’s first poem, “on the first day of love/ you wrapped me in the word special.” There is still love out there.Kaur’s poem “celebration” illustrates nature’s creatures struggling through the blossoming process. There is an expression of hesitation to continue their lives. This hesitation connects with every person who has at one time in their life refused to turn the page and move on. In order to grow, people must leave behind the toxicity.The collection ends on a note of pure hopefulness in “blooming.” This is the moment when the flower reaches full form and is able to stand alone. You are able to realize that you do not need another person to be whole anymore. There is a recognition of self-worth and a lesson to love what matters most: yourself.Her first poem reads: “the universe took its time on you/ crafted you to offer the world/ something different from everyone else/ when you doubt/ how you were created/ you doubt an energy greater than us both — irreplaceable.” That last word truly resonates with you, because it is crucial to go through each cycle to get to where you are now. The blooming is the epitome of why you are here. You are worth it. This is the reward after all the pain and trauma.Through the use of nature, Kaur expresses beauty and life by creating a sense of community in life’s inevitable pain. This collection of poetry has the capacity to mend and heal broken hearts. It proves the cliché that there is a light at the end of the tunnel by giving us hope when there seems to be none.There is a significant departure from Kaur’s reputation as a mere Tumblr Girl to a voice of social justice. She is unafraid to speak her mind about taboo subjects and shows the unique power that her poems can hold.Brevity is the soul of Instapoetry, as seen in her ability to condense our world into a short poem. Her words give a sense of relief by giving validation that pain is not a unique experience but something which is extremely relatable.“the sun and her flowers” is candid, beautiful and succeeds in snagging the hearts of every reader. Kaur proves that feelings matter, and she understands the value of the human heart and the respect that a living, breathing, creating person deserves. The voice of her poetry provides a path of healing.I encourage everyone to take time out of their day to give Rupi Kaur’s newest collection more than a cursory glance — I guarantee it will be worth it.It’s the recipe of life.Lauren Souza is the Daily Cardinal's literature columnist.

https://www.dailycardinal.com/article/2018/10/student-groups-shed-light-on-domestic-violence-in-the-undocumented-community,10/22/2018,"A group of 16 UW-Madison students gathered Monday night to discuss Domestic Violence within Undocumented Communities, an event sponsored by Promoting Awareness Victim Empowerment and Dreamers of UW-Madison.The event focused on the unique challenges undocumented communities face when confronting issues of domestic violence.The discussion is part of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, celebrated in October to recognize and combat domestic violence.Domestic violence affects people of all genders, ages, sexual orientations, races, ethnicities, religions, social standings and immigration statuses, PAVE Evaluation Coordinator Delaney Heffner said.“We are working to dismantle the specific narrative that a survivor is a certain race or certain class,” Heffner said.Joined by Heffner to facilitate the event was Jazmin Vargas, president and co-founder of Dreamers of UW-Madison.“[Domestic violence in the undocumented community] is important to address,” said Vargas. “It is an issue not specific to only one group.”Heffner said domestic violence is not always spousal and it is not always physical — it can be between anyone under one roof, and can be emotional or financial.Undocumented immigrants face higher domestic abuse rates than natural born citizens, but the exact numbers don’t exist, due in part to the barriers they face when seeking help or justice from domestic violence. These barriers include racism and discrimination, language barriers, blackmailing, immigration status as coercion and the fear of deportation.Vargas said you can learn about the experiences of undocumented immigrants and give them resources as well as believe and respect them in order to help.
