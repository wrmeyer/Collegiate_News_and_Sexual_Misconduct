       "'Editor’s note: Special thanks to Jessica Morgan, director of the Minnesota Women’s Center, and Muhammad Elrashidi, president of the Muslim Student Association for their guidance on this story.  It is better to have one person die than to have the whole family die of shame or disgrace.  ” Currently serving time in prison, the Jordanian man who said the above had just recently put four bullets into his sister’s head — in their living room — and was very proud of it.  It’s called an honor killing.  Honor killing is when a male relative decides to take the life of his female relative because, for one reason or another, she tarnished the family image.  In the above brother’s case, his sister supposedly had been raped, so he shot her; it was her fault she got raped.  This recent horror tale was exposed by Diane Sawyer on “20/20.  ” She interviewed the brother face to face, and the impact of seeing the smugness on his face is something that will never leave me.  The village where he lived considers him a hero.  Additional graphic footage on the show revealed another slain sister lying in the street with a crowd of villagers celebrating her brutal killing in the name of honor.  CNN also recently did a live coverage as well, but finding information on honor killing is not easy.  It’s another one of the world’s dirty secrets.  In Egypt, Nora Marzouk Ahmed was murdered by her father, Khaled Al-Qudra, in 1997.  He cut her head off, seven days after she eloped.  Back in Jordan, there are about 25 honor killings a year, a quarter of the country’s homicides.  It’s an ancient custom and it took a woman reporter for the Jordan Times, Rana Husseini, to be the first to break the story of honor killing to the world.  Suspicion is enough to warrant death.  Also in Jordan, two sisters were burned to death only to have an autopsy reveal that they weren’t the alleged virgins the family thought they were.  No arrests were made.  Queen Noor of Jordan was asked why the killers get such lenient sentences.  She says because it’s ancient cultural traditions.  Queen Noor claims to be on a campaign to end honor killings.  She is a member and former president of the International Steering Committee on the Economic Advancement of Rural Women as well as current president of the General Federation of Jordanian Women.  Amman, Jordan is one of the most modern capitals in the Arab world.  A growing democracy offers hope that through due process, perhaps this ancient tradition can ultimately be sent to its grave, and the desert cowboys who think they can murder women — their own family — in the name of honor will meet global condemnation of the fiercest kind.  There is no justification for honor killing, not in the name of cultural relativism, not in the name of any God, not in the name of anything.  I called Jessica Morgan at the Minnesota Woman’s Center on campus.  Her comments were crucial to tempering my outrage.  She asked me important questions like, “Who gets to judge it; who gets to justify it?” Through our conversation, I was forced to see honor killing within the cultural context it exists.  But fortunately, within a global context, exclusive cultural tradition is no longer a defense for murder or hurting anyone in any way.  This is not an argument about when murder is justifiable, such as an act of self-defense.  Shooting your sister in the head for having sex is not an act of self-defense.  It is a brutal murder; a crime of the worst order.  Morgan offered assurance that people will get involved, if they see.  People can talk.  People can persuade.  Support messages can be sent to Queen Noor.  On a foreign policy level, sanctions are in order, but given the United States’ relationship with Jordan — a most lucrative one at that — diplomats seem all too willing to look the other way.  Morgan says there are ways to maintain the strength of our cultures without hurting others.  God, I hope she’s right.  Don’t think this honor thing has merit.  The brother who thinks it’s OK to blow away his sister in the name of family honor, is also proud of the fact that he can go out with girls and do whatever he likes “but my sister can’t do that.  ” Morgan wondered if he felt any sadness.  In the interview, he was asked if he regretted what he did.  “No, I would do it again and again.  ”Allegedly, hundreds of women are killed every year in Gaza, the West Bank, Turkey, Egypt and throughout other parts of the Mideast.  How many on an international scale is unknown.  Back in 1997, when Ahmed was murdered by her father, who was then attorney general in the Palestinian National Authority, he told a woman’s group that he suspected close to 70 percent of all murders in Gaza and the West Bank are honor killings.  Article 341 of Jordanian law considers murder a legitimate act of defense when “the act of killing another or harming another was committed as an act in defense of his life, or his honor, or somebody else’s life or honor.  ” Man, what a ticket to ride.  Let’s say eliminating Article 341 is another place to start.  Another call to Muhammad Elrashidi, president of the Muslim Student Association, helped immensely to put this horrible human act into perspective.  Elrashidi also saw the “20/20” broadcast, and condemns honor killing.  He stressed the importance of ensuring that readers do not associate honor killing with the Islamic faith.  The brother who shot his sister is a Druze, and the honor killing he committed has no Islamic or other religious basis.  Under Islamic law, in the case of adultery, four witnesses are required along with a full trial, and if the accuser can’t prove the accusation, the accuser will be punished.  Honor killing is tribal or cultural, and, as Elrashidi so poignantly illustrated, they happen all over the world by gangs and individuals from China to Brazil.  Wherever honor killing prevails, and whatever the definition of honor may be, there is no justification on any level for such continued brutal assaults directed toward women.

They also work with local childcare facilities to provide childcare to students who are also parents.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are the coordination body that has served to connect people that may not have been working together before, but do so now,” Alex-Assensoh said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn campus, one of OWA’s most popular programs is the Women in Science Program, which provides resources and professional development opportunities for female scientists at IU to get together and talk about their work on a monthly basis.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This really helps undergraduate female scientists understand what the profession is like,” Alex-Assensoh said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of OWA’s efforts to promote female scientists on campus, they are sponsoring the new Thematic Community for Women in Science, Technology and Mathematics, which will debut in the residence halls in the fall of 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother recent project of OWA, in conjunction with the Office of the Dean of Students and the Office of the Provost, was a mandatory online session about sexual assault education that was taken by all freshmen and transfer students this past fall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve heard that the participants really did learn a lot,” Alex-Assensoh said. “It was a not a burden for them, and they said it was a pleasure to learn how to build healthy relationships and how to keep oneself safe on campus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother OWA program is Savant, which is made up of peer educators who raise awareness about empowerment, gender equity, ethical living and social justice. In addition, OWA serves as an entry point for people to express concern about things that are going on in the workplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlyce D. Fly, Associate Professor of Dietetics and Nutrition Science, is one of the many faculty members involved with OWA. She said she shares many of the same beliefs as OWA and aims to accomplish many of the same goals in her own work.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My programs in HPER serve predominantly female students, and so I have a special interest in having my students successfully navigate the university and move on to make important contributions to their professional fields,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs OWA gets ready to celebrate its fortieth anniversary in the spring, they remain focused on the organization’s original goals of helping women achieve greatness, lead effectively and make a positive difference on the global stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“OWA has always been an incubator of ideas on campus and has been the conscience of the university in terms of how it addresses issues of inclusion and equity,” Alex-Assensoh said.',\n",

Simon Hillel Center’s fund to search for Lauren Spierer. IUSA was also one of the organizations that helped organize and manpower searches for the missing IU student.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September, the student government and many other campus organizations collaborated to create the Shine4Lauren Awareness Concert.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not just having, per se, specific programs, but responding to current issues,” Lillie said. “There have been many collaborations with other student organizations. That’s been the most surprising part and maybe even the best part.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLillie also highlighted IUSA’s ongoing push for tax-free textbooks and an Indiana Lifeline Law. The law would be a statewide version of Hoosier P.A.C.T, a campus alcohol use response policy — which IUSA fought to implement in September — that encourages students to seek medical attention in cases of alcohol overconsumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe semester has not been without its setbacks. IUSA’s biggest challenge, in regard to its larger initiatives, has been time, as both of the statewide initiatives are long-term projects with many intermediate steps.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We were unsure about how much we would be able to get done with those initiatives this year,” she said. “Time is a huge setback in terms of our initiatives. It’s something that, on a few of our projects, we didn’t expect them to happen as soon as they did.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIUSA was disappointed when IU learned in November it had lost its bid to host a 2012 presidential debate. IUSA devoted time and energy to the project, hosting the Commission on Presidential Debates on campus, garnering the support of other Big Ten Schools and aiding in planning of a potential debate.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the downsides, Lillie believes IUSA is in a good place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think we’re on track with what we’ve set out to do initially,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n-Matthew Glowicki',\n",

       "  'body': 'I’ve lived in Bloomington my entire life. I walked from Ballantine Hall to Sycamore Hall before I could tie my own shoes. I learned how to drive on the same one-way streets that never fail to cause trouble during move-in week. I knew what courses to order at Siam House before I knew what courses to take freshman year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow this sounds to you probably depends on whether you’re an East Coast native charmed by Bloomington’s tree-lined streets or a weary townie disenchanted with the same old coffeehouses and public parks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis place, this community, still hasn’t lost its magic for me. Maybe it’s because I’m still finding new nooks and crannies to explore. Maybe it’s because I feel some sort of comfort and ownership from recognizing faces downtown.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether this is the first fall you’ve spent in town or what you hope is your last, you know something for sure: Bloomington isn’t scary.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might think it still isn’t. We obviously don’t know the crime of a big city. But something is going on. These past few weeks are starting to feel a little bit like the second season of “Twin Peaks.” Strange and disturbing things keep happening without warning — the kinds of things that don’t really mesh with the Bloomington I know.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo reported hate crimes occurred early in October on campus. Swastikas were drawn on the dry-erase board of a Jewish student’s door in Briscoe Quad, and death threats were written on the dry-erase board of a lesbian student’s door in Foster Quad. The Chabad House has had two Hebrew characters stolen from its main sign.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have already been several reported rapes and sexual assaults on campus this semester. Last Friday, the Monroe County Public Library was closed due to a bomb threat. Last Sunday, an armed man broke into a convenience store to steal cigarettes. Later that morning, a non-student fired a gun outside the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day, a 60-year-old woman was shot in the leg while walking her dog. On Thursday, a different woman was robbed at gunpoint. And as most of you probably know by now, Adam Sarnecki, a 22-year-old Pizza X delivery driver and Bloomington native, was shot and killed early Friday morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese tragedies are distressing on their own terms. They become almost unbelievable when you realize they’ve all occurred within the last few weeks. As one of my friends asked, “When did Bloomington turn into Compton?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the kinds of stories I rarely heard when I was younger. I’m sure I was too busy watching “Boy Meets World” and drinking chocolate milk to notice whatever horrors roamed the streets outside my window, but I can’t remember anything close to what’s going on right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy no means do I intend to idealize this city. Bloomington has known its fair share of crime in the past. I don’t think this is some sleepy town filled with nothing but good folks who’ve never seen tragedy. This is a real city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s just a certain anxiety around town I haven’t felt here before. A few of my friends told me their parents were worried about them getting to and from work. Some wondered if this quasi-crime wave was over. At the time of this writing, 320 people voted in an IDS online poll asking, “Is Bloomington becoming more dangerous?” An overwhelming 80 percent answered yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the opinion staff meeting Friday, we were trying to think of solutions or explanations for what’s going on. I thought maybe the planets had aligned themselves in a particularly malicious way. Someone else proposed a police state to get the situation under control. We turned to jokes because it’s hard to process so much crime happening over a short period of time in a city that doesn’t usually feel dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s somewhat relieving to consider the community’s response to a few of the incidents. Pizza X south is having a fundraiser for the Sarnecki family through Wednesday. The IU-Notify text alerts sent out after the shooting last Sunday morning might have been vague and alarming, but they effectively communicated the presence of a threat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBloomington isn’t suddenly America’s crime capital. This isn’t a disaster area. The world is still turning. Finals are approaching. The leaves have gone from gold to the ground. The last football game of the year is quickly approaching, and basketball season is already underway.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these expected realities, it’s sometimes easy to forget the unexpected. The hollow advice to be careful is something we’ve heard from our parents since we were children, so I won’t offer it here. I’m not trying to put you on edge more than you already are.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, take care and remember Bloomington isn’t just a peaceful paradise of studying and partying.

We’re all behind condom use, but the latest over-stated headline in the IDS, “The Dirty Little Secret about IU: IU drops to 63rd in college campus sexual health ranking” is rather over the top, don’t you think? This is a “survey” that didn’t even account for Kinsey Confidential originating at IU or the “anonymous sex column” in not just the IDS, but in the student papers around the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat’s also missing is the impact of IU research on sexual health, such as last week’s presentations at national conferences on condom use, sexual side effects of contraception, bi-sexual men’s health and alcohol effects on sexuality. If there are truly secrets hindering sexual health on campus, let’s expose them. Such sensational headlines give lots of weight to bogus marketing ploys.   \\r\\n\\r\\n— Jennifer Bass, communications director at The Kinsey Institute\\r\\n\\r\\nI am responding to the very moving account of Bailey Loosemore’s experience of her sexual assault last year and its aftermath. This account is both an act of courage and a story of emerging clarity as she grappled to name what had been done to her and grappled with questions she herself had asked, as many victims do, about “Why didn’t I do something?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aspect of this story that struck me is the role that empathy, or the lack of it, can have in helping or retarding the healing process. In her moving account, Ms. Loosemore shares with us that her friends, for all kinds of reasons, were not available to do the one empathic thing she had hoped they could do, and that is to listen. Often, we don’t know what to say when someone shares a traumatic experience with us, not realizing that it is not what we say but how well we listen that is most helpful to a friend. Most of us do not really understand the true power of empathic listening.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ms. Loosemore did finally seek professional help, her experience with her therapist was mixed. Clearly, as Ms. Loosemore recounts, the therapist was right that the trauma had more impact on her than she realized. But Ms. Loosemore also recognized where the therapist seemed to go wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result, the therapist was in some significant ways experienced as not empathic. How so? In my experience, sometimes when therapists think of themselves and advertise themselves as specialists in, say, “sexual assault” or “adult children of alcoholics” or other topical specialties, they tend to view and hear everything a client says through that particular lens. In trying to be empathic and helpful, the therapist ends up being neither.\\r\\n\\r\\nMs. Loosemore was and is intuitively aware that unless the roots of lack of self-confidence are also addressed, it becomes hard to believe in yourself and your perceptions of what is happening when you need to the most.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— Gilbert Marsh, M.S.W.',\n",

Why shouldn’t it?\\r\\n\\r\\nFour-letter exclamations should pepper our speech. They make language more interesting and let us express frustration or joy. I would never preach Sunday School morality about cursing or warn you that cursing is the last refuge of the ignorant mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nI love expletives as much as the next undergraduate. Maybe even more than the average student. There are plenty of times when the majority of my speech is foul, especially immediately before and after exams.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was raised by a woman who cursed like a sailor, and I dare say I learned from the best. But last summer, my roommate and I made a pact: we were no longer going to use the word “bitch.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made this decision because that word, unlike most of the other baseline curse words, is inexcusably misogynist. I’m sure that plenty of apologists will furiously proclaim that the word refers to a female dog and isn’t sexist at all, but that explanation is flimsy at best.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a culture, we’re a long time removed from the word having anything to do with canine anatomy. Instead, the word now refers to two very damaging stereotypes, one about women and one about men.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen used to describe a woman, the word means that she’s cold, cruel, and catty. Or maybe she’s vindictive, demanding, and back-stabbing. When used as a verb, the word references the image of the complaining woman who is never satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, the apologists will shout that the word can be used to describe these traits in men as well. But it isn’t. One of the double standards we’re all familiar with is the assertive career woman who gets labeled a bitch for behaving in the same way as her male colleagues.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s simply dishonest to pretend that women and men are treated the same or that the word means the same thing, regardless of context. When the word is used to describe a man, it’s a label that he isn’t sufficiently masculine. He’s either a submissive wimp or a cringing coward.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorse, in the eyes of our misogynist culture, he’s being compared to a woman. This is the ultimate insult in a society that continually oppresses women and sets them apart as subservient to men.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, the specter of sexual assault in the prison system is invoked by the phrase “my bitch.” What could be more reprehensible than making a mockery of the anguish of real victims of sexual assault in order to score cheap laughs in a conversation?\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the reasons that my roommate and I set out to purge the word from our vocabularies. We could no longer ignore the real social problems reflected in how casually and frequently the word is used.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time the word is used, it only strengthens harmful stereotypes about women, men, and the relations between the two. I implore you to do the same. At the very least, the next time someone uses the word around you, stop and think about what they really mean.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— atcrane@indiana.edu',\n",

Mandated by their probation or parole officer, they waited to attend a free showing of the 1993 movie “Rudy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter passing through the security-guarded metal detector, the offenders lined up again at the information booth and checked in with probation officer Ken Bugler.\\r\\n\\r\\nEleven years ago, Bugler, an adult probation officer focusing on sex offenders, started the event “No Trick-or-Treating for Sex Offenders.” The event requires every person in the county on probation, who has committed a sex offense in which the victim was a minor, to meet at the Justice Building on Halloween during Bloomington’s trick-or-treating hours, 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. For the last four years, sex offenders on parole have also attended the meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sex offenders mingled in the lobby of the Justice Building while the remainder of the offenders checked in.\\r\\n\\r\\nRocky, a 45-year-old man who was incarcerated for a sex offense involving a minor in 2007, spoke positively about the night’s film selection.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know, it’s based on a true story of a football player at Notre Dame,” Rocky said. As Rocky spoke, he crossed his arms across his chest and slowly swayed left and right. Rocky got his nickname while he was incarcerated. He spent 13 months in the Monroe County Jail. During this time, other inmates dubbed him Rocky because his anxiety disorders cause him to fidget uncontrollably.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is awesome,” a man said to Rocky sarcastically, the hood of his black sweatshirt pulled over his head and barely obscuring a neck tattoo. “It’s Halloween and I’ve gotta watch some goddamn football.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Rocky said he likes the movie “Rudy.” He has seen it multiple times. In fact, he  used to own it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after 5:30 p.m., Bugler led the sex offenders to a courtroom upstairs, Room 301.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large glass wall divided the seating into two sections. The room smelled distinctively of male cologne.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the front of the courtroom was a large flat-screen television, but the distance between it and the seating made it appear small.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the men were allowed to leave the courtroom to use the restroom and had the option to read a book rather than watch the film, they had to stay in the Justice Building for the three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The basic purpose is twofold,” Bugler said. “Number one, it gets the guys off the street who have a conviction that put them on the sex offender registry. This would help them to be safe so that if anybody were to make an allegation, they have an actual alibi that they were with their probation officer. It also helps the community by getting those guys off the streets.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBugler said in the past he has shown “The Chronicles of Narnia,” “Up” and other films typically directed toward children. He said the purpose of the movie is simply to entertain and they are not picked for any specific reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nBugler said the event is to ensure a sexual assault does not happen on Halloween, though he does not recall any sexual assaults occurring on the holiday in the recent past.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For the most part, they understand and accept it,” Bugler said. “Some of the guys have not been pleased about being here, but again, it’s just a matter of being reported and directed by the order of the court.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut most of the guys have been with Bugler so many years, he said, that they are used to attending the movie night each Halloween.\\r\\n\\r\\nSex offenders are able to skip the meeting if they are unable to attend for medical reasons or they are at work. But if they are at work, Bugler said the probation officers require a statement from their employer explaining that the offender will be working. A probation officer also goes and checks to make sure they are where they say they are.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have not had anybody in the years I’ve been doing this not be where they’re supposed to be,” Bugler said. “The order of their probation specifies that they are to report as directed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOther than sounds emitted from the television, the dark courtroom was nearly silent. While men frequently passed in front of the television to leave the courtroom and returned with bottles of Coca-Cola, the offenders rarely spoke to one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nRocky sat in the back row, his eyes fixated on the television as he rocked back and forth in his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait, throw me off the team? Does that mean I’m on the team?” the film’s title character asked on the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yeah kid, you’re on the team,” the coach responded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Rudy gave his coach an unexpected hug, the sex offenders laughed. But moments like this were rare.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was silent as “Rudy” came to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Damn, we still have another hour,” one of the offenders said to another.\\r\\n\\r\\nBugler flipped on the bright courtroom lights.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” an offender said, getting the attention of Bugler. “Smoke break?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nope.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor nearly another hour, some of the sex offenders stayed in their seats in the courtroom. Others mingled in the lobby directly outside the door. Some spoke with each other, others remained in solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So, listen,” a man said, pointing out the faint grey facial hair on Rocky’s face. “Are you trying to grow a beard?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I just forgot to shave this morning,” Rocky said, laughing. “No, just kidding.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, Bugler said, “Have a good night, gentlemen,” dismissing the group 10 minutes early.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men began talking again. They walked swiftly down the stairs, past the security, out the front door of the Justice Building and into the dark, Halloween night.\\r\\n\\r\\nBugler remained upstairs as everyone left.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It just went as usual. No incidents and everything went really well, so I was very pleased,” Bugler said.',\n",

       "  'body': \"Editor's Note:\\r\\n\\r\\nThis piece is not one that typically appears in the Indiana Daily Student. It is a personal feature by one of our staffers, Bailey Loosemore, detailing the sexual assault she experienced last fall and the effect it had on her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe essay is powerful. This is something that you, as readers, could find difficult to read or not want to read at all. But this is a story that often goes untold on college campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy publishing this essay, we hope to bring light to this issue and break the silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\nFor the past year, I’ve struggled to accept what happened to me that night last fall. At first, I couldn’t even define it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I boil it down to two words: sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first days after, I couldn’t comprehend it. That couldn’t have happened to me. He was my friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew the statistics, but I never thought I’d be one of them. In the past decade, more than 700 sexual assaults were reported in Bloomington. Eighty percent of them were allegedly committed by acquaintances.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem’s not just in our community. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network reports that two-thirds of sexual assaults are committed by someone the victim knows.\\r\\n\\r\\nI look at these numbers now and realize they’re not theoretical.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\nOn Saturday, Nov. 6, I walked to a friend’s party four blocks from my house. I wanted a chill night, so I drank two beers and left before midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe streets were silent, but my house felt even quieter. Both my roommates were out of town, and my footsteps echoed on the wood floor as I headed upstairs to my bedroom. I checked my phone as daylight saving time ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nDownstairs, the back door opened, and familiar voices entered the kitchen. Though my roommates were gone, their two boyfriends had come to sleep in their beds — nothing unusual. Their boyfriends practically lived there, anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was common knowledge that our house was always open to friends. Usually, I didn’t mind the company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boyfriends went to bed, and I fell asleep in my room. At about 3:30 a.m., my phone vibrated on my pillow. Two other guys I knew were leaving the party I’d visited earlier and needed a place to crash. They’d already graduated and moved away from Bloomington. I told them I didn’t care; they could sleep on the couches.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited for them downstairs, wearing a high school T-shirt and a pair of boxers. The heat wasn’t on, and I shivered between yawns. The two friends walked to the front door, and I let them in. Only one bed aside from mine was open, and the guy who called claimed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other guy stayed in the hallway. I had made out with him twice during the summer and had stopped him the second time before it went too far.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in the hallway outside my room, I realized we hadn’t talked much since. Seeing him brought back the regret I had felt since that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe didn’t move. He asked to sleep in my room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t sleep on couches anymore. We won’t even touch.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSleep pulled at my eyes. I didn’t want to argue.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fine.”\\r\\n\\r\\nReeking of beer, he took off his shirt and slid under the covers on the left side of the bed. I crawled in on the right.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe asked to snuggle, so I slid a few inches closer. He pulled me in until the lengths of our bodies were touching, face to face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We should kiss,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m seeing someone,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t kiss your friends?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, not usually.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tried to kiss me anyway. I told him to stop and moved back to my edge of the bed. He pulled on my right shoulder to turn me toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe brought up the summer night when the two of us had made out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I just want to finish what we started,” he said. “Don’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held the right side of my body down, his hand tight on my shoulder. Then he pinned down my right leg with his knee.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, stop,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\nI squirmed, but he was at least a foot taller than me, and stronger. He stuck his hand inside my underwear. His breath hit my ear as his hand touched me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI froze. I couldn’t move, think, scream as I focused my eyes on the ceiling above my door. Finally, he let me go.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You should take it as a compliment that I ignored you,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\nThe next thing I knew, it was Sunday morning. The four guys were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy stomach was in knots. For a second I wondered if the friend had really stayed in my room. But I could still smell his scent on the pillow next to me. Had I drank too much? No, only two beers, both several hours before the friend had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ran to the bathroom and puked, then checked a clock. Work in 30 minutes. As I walked to Jimmy John’s, my body felt clammy but cold. I had taken a shower, but I still felt dirty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my mind, I ran through the previous night — the party, the walk home, the phone call at 3:30 a.m., the friend holding me down. I replayed what he said after.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You should take it as a compliment...”\\r\\n\\r\\nI told myself it was my fault. I had messed up, I thought. I had let him sleep in my bed.\\r\\nMy mind went back and forth. Even if I wasn’t to blame, I didn’t know how to explain what had happened or even what to call it. I was a writer, someone who told true stories for a living. But I couldn’t release this story from my mouth. I felt too ashamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a week, it was too much to keep in. I started telling bits and pieces to friends. How he had wanted to snuggle. How I had said no, but he didn’t stop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you think it was sexual assault?” one girlfriend asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers reacted with blank stares, quiet apologies. Nobody knew what to say; they’d never dealt with assault before. They told me to see a counselor.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, I don’t want a counselor’s help, I thought. I want your help.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanted them to understand it. But how could they, when even I couldn’t find the right words? I felt more lost than I had before telling them. So, I stopped telling anyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next few weeks, I was stuck in a loop. I realized the assault hadn’t been my fault, but it still made no sense. He was my friend. How could he have done that?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day before Thanksgiving, I called my mother, hard-core crying. At first, she couldn’t even understand what I was saying. I wasn’t going to make it home to Evansville. I couldn’t bring myself to leave my room.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy whole life I’d told my mom everything. So, when she drove up to get me, I couldn’t keep the assault a secret from her anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer response was the opposite of what I expected. “Why didn’t you do anything?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI stared out the car window. I was asking myself the same question, but I didn’t want to hear it from her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know why,” I said. “I just couldn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why didn’t I do something? I had just lain there. What was wrong with me? Three other guys were sleeping down the hall. I could’ve screamed and they would’ve come running. I could’ve fought back. Why didn’t I?\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day in the car, I couldn’t articulate an answer. But deep down I had known the truth all my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom childhood on, I’d had no self-confidence. Even as a junior in college, I still had trouble believing in myself — in my work, my writing, my relationships. And that night in my room, as he paid me his compliment, I’d lacked the confidence to fight back.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn’t think I was worth it.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\nDuring Christmas break, I gathered myself. When I returned to Bloomington, I cut back on my work hours, tried to rid myself of excess stress and moved into a studio apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil break, I had refused to consider counseling. But a few days into the spring\\r\\nsemester, I caved and began spending an hour a week with a counselor who specialized in sexual assault cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe counselor’s name was Ann. She had mousy brown hair and a quiet voice. Her office had a desk on one side and two armchairs on the other, plus a side table with a box of tissues. She sat in the chair closest to the window. I sat in the one closest to the door. I couldn’t look her in the eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the first time I’d told anyone the whole story. With family and friends, it felt like I was burdening them. But I could let Ann in without judgment. As the sessions went on and I told her everything, I felt lighter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you ever think about pressing charges?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I didn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s my friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnn said he wasn’t my friend if he’d done that to me, but I couldn’t see it like that. I didn’t want to ruin the guy’s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wanted me to confront him. Not right away, but when it felt right. It would give me closure, she said. The idea made me nervous.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could tell Ann cared about me and was trying to help. After a few sessions, though, I was getting frustrated. Everything I told her she explained away as a result of the assault, as though all my fears and actions were side effects of that one night.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I’ve always been like that,” I would say. But she’d cut me off. “When you’re\\r\\nassaulted...”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt felt like Ann wasn’t hearing what I was saying. I didn’t see how all the things I felt — the depression, the loneliness, the sense of loss — could be tied to the assault. I began to doubt the counselor’s advice, thinking I could handle the situation better on my own.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when she told me that I was getting better, that I only needed to see her once a month instead of every week, I canceled my next session.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day, Ann called my cell phone. I let it go to voicemail and never called her back.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\nA few days later, I got my first reality check. The counselor had been more right about the assault’s effects than I’d wanted to believe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile walking home from dinner, I lost my credit card and driver’s license. When I couldn’t find them anywhere, I broke down. I sat on my apartment floor throwing clothes, shoes and the contents of my backpack around the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside, I knew I was freaking out about something I could easily solve. I could call my bank in the morning. I could get a new license. But, once again, I had lost control. I had made a mistake I could have prevented.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard my mom saying, “Why didn’t you do something?” I could have screamed, I could have fought back, I could have said no one more time.\\r\\n\\r\\nShaking, I curled into a ball on the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\nDuring the next month, I sleepwalked through my classes and work. I spent hours alone in my Bloomington apartment. I told my friends I was fine and tried not to think about the assault. I signed onto Facebook constantly, noting the people who were still close to the guy who assaulted me despite knowing he’d hurt me. I stood in front of people, but my mind was far away. I couldn’t see past the next hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks before spring break, I’d had enough. It was time to start taking care of myself. I turned off my phone, stopped checking Facebook, stopped texting people. I deliberately took a week to breathe, be quiet and think. I set up a routine that made each day easier to process — running three miles a day, making dinner instead of eating out, planning free time into my days.\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew what I needed to do next. I emailed the guy, asking to talk. I didn’t have any expectations; I just wanted him to know what I felt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day he texted me and suggested we talk that night. He was busy until 6 p.m. and would call after. My phone rang while I was at a dinner, so I went out to the sidewalk to talk.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stood with my back against a brick wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn’t figure out how to start. I paused, trying to picture the words before saying them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you remember that party when you stayed the night?” I asked. “Do you remember what happened?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yeah,” he said. “I was drunk, but I remember some of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI paused again, longer this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I said no.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why didn’t you stop?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was sexual assault.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time he paused.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know. I’m so sorry.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phone call didn’t last long.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope we can be friends,” he said before hanging up. “Do you think we can be?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaning forward from the wall, I breathed. Again, I felt lighter. I had stood up for myself and told him what I thought, and he acknowledged that what he did was wrong. I wasn’t crazy for thinking I had been sexually assaulted. I could finally accept it.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few weeks later, I went to a party at the same house as the one in November. About an hour after I arrived, I noticed the guy across the room. My heart beat faster; I hadn’t seen him in months. Then, I got a text message from an unknown number.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can I give you a hug?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI knew it was him. By now, I’d surfaced from my depression. For the first time in months, I was happy. Surely I could manage a hug.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe met near the front door. He wrapped his arms around my shoulders, and I lightly put my hands around his back. I felt queasy. Then, we parted ways, not saying a word to each other the rest of the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I stayed at the party a few hours more, knowing the guy was only a room away, I knew I’d forgiven him. But I’d also found the answer to his question. We’d never be friends again.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, nearly a year after the assault, I think about what happened less every day and continue to talk about it. While I struggled at first to define what happened, I don’t let the assault define me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFINDING HELP\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you find yourself in a similar situation, don’t hesitate to seek help from the IU Health Center 24-Hour Sexual Assault Crisis Line at (812) 855-8900.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Reader comments for this story were disabled given its sensitive nature.

Students offered practical suggestions for staying safe at parties or simply walking home from evening classes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We need to look at physical safety and get some of those tips ... but we don’t want it to be a scary thing or a blame thing,” Moss said. “Stuff happens.

       "  'body': 'Recently, I was having a conversation with one of my good friends at school. She was worried that her parents wouldn’t allow her to spend next semester studying abroad in Paris.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry,” I said. “If you don’t go, at least you won’t end up like ?Amanda Knox.” She didn’t get the joke because she had no idea who Amanda Knox was, and it was an irrelevant ?connection, anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend has nothing to worry about, for her experiences will undoubtedly mirror many of those who went abroad before her. Every spring semester, half the junior class of my sorority departs for a semester of studying in a foreign ?country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether they are bound for Florence or Barcelona, their stories and experiences will inevitably blend together interchangeably. They will be greeted at the airport by representatives from their programs and will be taken to student housing clusters, where they will live with other American students, many of whom they know prior to embarking on their travels.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce situated, they will go out to clubs frequented by other American students, sightsee in packs with their extended group of roommates and friends and meet other people from all over the Big Ten.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “studying” part of studying abroad won’t actually happen — unless you count food and wine pairing and soccer as legitimate ?academic classes. I always thought of these organized programs as expensive, extended vacations abroad, lacking the individual quality and unique cultural experience that comes with exploring an unknown ?territory on your own terms.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, after following the horror story that was Amanda Knox’s junior year abroad, I am compelled to ?reconsider this sentiment. Perhaps there is something to be said for experiencing the world within the confines of an organized ?program.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreed Monday after four years in an Italian jail cell, Knox finally returned to the United States after being acquitted of sexually assaulting and murdering her former roommate, British student Meredith Kercher.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the most troubling aspect of the case is the fact that Knox, a naive American student with no criminal record and a good reputation, had become involved in a murder investigation in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough most study abroad students go through some sort of organized ?program, Knox acted more independently. Responsible for securing her own housing, she spontaneously moved into the apartment she and Kercher would share with two older Italian women.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took a job as a waitress at a local cafe to make some extra cash and began a relationship with a fellow student, native Italian ?Raffaele Sollecito. This immersion into typical Italian daily life and isolation from her peers is vastly different from the stories I’ve heard from friends who have gone abroad through student travel companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking back, it is easy to see how Knox was swept up in the investigation. Alone in a foreign country, Knox could barely speak the language, had no access to a lawyer and knew nothing of the Italian legal system.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from this, there was no one there to offer counsel at the time of her arrest \\xad— with her parents hours away in the U.S., she could have benefited from the support of a representative from an organized program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Knox’s story has a happy ending, it serves as a warning for all those who choose to spend time abroad. I’ve always dismissed the big-box program providers as sanitized ways of viewing the world. You may not find me on one anytime soon, but I can see the benefits ?they provide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— ellethom@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Amanda Knox was acquitted of murder charges in Italy on Monday after four long years. I’ll provide a bit of background for those who don’t know. In 2007, British exchange student Meredith Kercher was found dead in her apartment in Perugia, Italy, half-naked and her throat slit.\\r\\n\\r\\nKercher’s American roommate, Amanda Knox from the University of Washington, and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were indicted in 2008 and charged with murder and sexual assault before filing for appeal in 2010. All of them were studying in Italy at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmittedly, I didn’t know much about the trial while it was going on until the last few days. I had heard about it while I studied in Italy last spring, but my information was limited to what other American students were saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard about her nickname “Foxy Knoxy.” I was told accounts of the story with different details each time. In a case such as this, that type of information is hardly anything to base an opinion on, so I never formed one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, my attitude was generally negative toward her. In a general sense, it was like the Casey Anthony case, because it stirred up emotions in people.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone had to be guilty and it was such an awful thing to happen. That’s kind of what I thought when I didn’t know anything about it. But when I looked at the actual details and caught up, I realized how extremely weak the prosecutor’s case was.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe physical evidence was shoddy and the prosecutor’s first crack at convicting Knox was an extremely plausible satanic ritual.\\r\\n\\r\\nWait. What?\\r\\n\\r\\nWho is Italian Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini, and why does he think he is the dude from “CSI: Miami”? Seriously, of all the evidence reported, that is what they came up with? Like I said, I studied in Italy, and they definitely do things differently, but, wow — that’s really different. To be honest, after studying there, I’m not that surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter taking a class on the mafia in southern Italy, you believe basically anything could happen in their justice system. I guess the Carabinieri in Perugia really had a tough time with this big case and processing the evidence. Then Mignini said, “To hell with it. If I’m going to lose, I might as well accuse them of a satanic ritual because it happened the day after Halloween.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMignini even had a reason for delaying it a day, saying they would have done it on Halloween, but they postponed the ritual because of a dinner party their roommate\\r\\nwas having.  Now I’ve come to realize how skewed the buzzwords made my perceptions of this story.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s weird realizing you’ve been influenced by buzzwords. Normally I rely on Jon Stewart to clue me into the buzzwords that are popular among the TV pundits, but I’m too busy for TV nowadays.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid she do it? I don’t know that, but I don’t think the evidence is enough to put a person away for 26 years. There will probably be a movie deal for Knox soon, and books are already out. Both girls were attractive, which was always mentioned to play up the “killer looks” angle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can’t really blame her for wanting to take a deal and for selling her story in order to help her family out of the financial pain from these trials.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when she does sell her story, it pushes Kercher’s death further into the background. The death of the young woman is closer to becoming a teen horror flick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— agreiner@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Ex-International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn returned to France Sunday after a months-long, headline-making trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn, who was the leading presidential candidate for the French Socialist Party, were dropped last week. He was accused of raping hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo at a New York hotel early this summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe press, as usual, asked the wrong questions and drew the wrong conclusions about the trial. While I’m hardly qualified to comment on the judge’s decision (though this does reek of yet another instance of a powerful man getting away with sexual violence), I am upset with the media’s presentation of the case.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs tidbits about Diallo’s past were slowly revealed and speculated upon, including connections to prostitution and inaccuracies in her political asylum papers, so too were doubts raised about her credibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause we all know only the most upstanding citizens, and especially not prostitutes, can be raped.Also troubling is that underlying these accusations, many articles label her as a Guinean, Muslim woman, as if these identities would inform the public of her motivations or experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t remember any articles prefacing Strauss-Kahn with the description, “white, Jewish.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intersection of Diallo’s race, religious affiliation and class can, however, inform of certain ills of the media and judicial system. I don’t think I’m shocking anyone when I say this country’s laws seem to favor and were largely written by privileged white men. That a privileged white man prevailed in this case against a working-class woman of color is, as a friend of mine wrote, “the opposite of unbelievable.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seems to me yet another missed opportunity to take an important stand against the way the law configures and the media portray sexual violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy is no one bothered that it seems incredibly difficult to prosecute sexual assault charges? That the responsibility lies with the victim to prove the guilt of the attacker? That existing laws do so little to prevent sexual assault?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would seem violence against women is an assumed part of our culture, let alone our Constitution, which fails time and time again to promote sex equality.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of my feelings about this issue are informed by and indebted to feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon. In her book “Women’s Lives, Men’s Laws,” MacKinnon writes, “Awareness of social hierarchy is absent in the criminal law of rape’s treatment of force.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, the law doesn’t take into account existing sex inequality as a constitutive influence on sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this case, where a powerful male politician was charged with raping a working-class female, the court and the press appeared to deny that these inequalities could figure into Strauss-Kahn’s coercive force.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the contrary, many articles I’ve read have established a narrative of inequality disadvantaging Strauss-Kahn.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been said that his political clout made him vulnerable to the “con artist” Diallo, or that these allegations were some sort of conspiracy against the French Socialist Party. He was the victim, not her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho is wondering how Strauss-Kahn’s political clout may have actually empowered him to commit sexual violence? Again, this sort of language is not at all unbelievable, even if it is despairing.The Strauss-Kahn case is destined to be another political “sex scandal” and not an opportunity to challenge popular dialogues about sex inequality and the epidemic of rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd unless he decides to run for office, and polls show half of French Socialists wouldn’t object, I imagine this story will be forgotten in just a few news cycles. This trial begs the question — what is important to us?\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last week’s Video Music Awards, Chris Brown sang, danced (and flew?) while the audience pretended he hadn’t assaulted Rihanna two years ago. Tyler, The Creator, took home the Best New Artist award, in spite of, or because of, his brutal, misogynistic lyrics.\\r\\n\\r\\nOurs is the sort of culture that forgives, forgets and rewards men for using women. Now is the time to question and protest language that promotes sexual violence and sex inequality.\\r\\n\\r\\nRape and violence against women are more than scandal. They are the result of real sex inequality that we constantly and unconsciously reproduce.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s time to refuse the inevitability of sex inequality and assert the possibility of a world where sex equality is manifest and defensible in our law and embraced and lived in our culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— ptbeane@indiana.edu',\n",

Still, there is much room left for improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent statistics from the National School Climate Survey show nine in 10 GLBT students report being verbally harassed in high schools because of sexual orientation.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite this shortcoming, Bloomington appears to be continuing the progress in social understanding that began with the establishment of the Kinsey Institute.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because of the university, because of the open nature of the community, Bloomington has become our nation’s fifth largest per capita population of same-sex couples because they’re welcome,” said Beverly Calender-Anderson, director of the Safe and Civil City Program.\\r\\n\\r\\nIU has resources, such as the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transexual Student Support Service, that educate students on these issues of abuse and support students who have been harassed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside of the university, resources for GLBT community members are less specific, and the tolerance of the community is more ambiguous.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The campus is accepting of gay students. People who live in town are probably not as tolerant,” recent graduate Chase Casey said. “I personally don’t care. As long as you don’t throw it in my face, people can do what they want.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancisco Tirado, a transfer student from DePaul University in Chicago, said the community is comparable to what he experienced at his former, liberal school.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Coming to Bloomington, it was interesting to see the difference, or how not so different they were, because Bloomington is a pretty liberal city,” Tirado said. “Perhaps the gay community isn’t as loud here, but it still has a voice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a GLBT anti-harassment team at IU that keeps track of incidents of harassment on campus. An incident can be anything from verbal abuse to actual physical assault on rare occasions. The number of these incidents has been declining in the past decade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Supporting students who have suffered abuse is a very small part of what we do,” Doug Bauder, director of the GLBT office, said. “It really does not define us. We are much more involved in education and advocacy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with the support, there is still room to grow. Bauder said he would like to see the Bloomington atmosphere expand to other areas around the state.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students who talk to classes at IU through our program with the Health Center,” Bauder said. “I’d like to train some of those students to go back to their high schools and help the administration and students create a friendlier atmosphere in those schools.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTirado said he had a different idea on how to benefit the welfare of the gay community.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not about the organizations, it’s about the community,” he said. “Honestly, a gay bar would help. I think it would be a lot more helpful than GLBT groups would be.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'A recent Chicago Tribune investigation revealed that of the women who report cases of sexual assault on college campuses, few see their attackers arrested or convicted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that is about to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent “Dear Colleague” letter from the Office for Civil Rights within the U.S. Department of Education will most likely assure there will be more sexual assault convictions, at least coming from university judicial boards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter, sent to all public institutions of higher education, mandates that universities, which receive federal funding, adopt the “preponderance of evidence” standard when investigating reports of rape or sexual misconduct. If a university does not adopt this standard, it risks losing all of its federal funding.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it might seem with these actions the Department of Education should be commended for tackling such an issue, it has, in fact, decided to use a regulatory wrecking ball when perhaps an exacting scalpel needed to be applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy forcing universities to use the preponderance of the evidence standard — the lowest standard of proof — the Department of Education has guaranteed more innocent students will be found guilty, something that would not occur if it had mandated a more exacting standard of evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Harvey Silverglate reported on one of the first public victims since the mandatory institution of this standard:\\r\\n \\r\\nOn February 19, 2010, University of North Dakota student Caleb Warner was found guilty of “Violations of Criminal or Civil Laws, Sexual Assault, and Interference [with members of the university community]” by a campus judicial board.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conviction stems from a December 13, 2009, incident in which Warner had what he claimed was consensual sex with a fellow student.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite Warner’s claim, sometime before February 9, 2010, the student reported to campus officials and the Grand Forks, N.D., police department Warner had raped her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the university swiftly brought a guilty verdict to Warner, banning him from stepping foot on UND grounds or any other public institution of higher education in North Dakota for three years, the Grand Forks Police Department declined to prosecute Warner.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, the police department applied for a warrant for his accuser’s arrest, a request that a judge later granted.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Grand Forks authorities, Warner’s accuser lied to investigators about the incident, a class A misdemeanor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accuser has since fled to California, according to Warner, and for this type of warrant, extradition is unlikely.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Warner’s attorney and the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education asked for a rehearing because of the GFPD’s findings, which includes a text message from the accuser indicating she wanted to have sex with Warner, the university denied it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to UND counsel, when UND conducted its hearing they used the same evidence the police and prosecutor used to charge the accuser with lying to law enforcement authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Warner was found guilty in the university judicial system, he has since had to put his education on hold and carry with him the stigma of a rapist.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he may be the first public victim since the OCR required its new evidentiary standard, you can be sure he won’t be the last.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy forgoing the “clear and convincing” evidentiary standard that most top colleges usually applied to allegations of sexual assault, the OCR has also forgone fundamental fairness and committed its own acts of metaphorical violence against student rights, against due process and against the founding principles of our nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey have determined college students need fewer protections than the normal citizen and turned campus judicial bodies into Star Chambers where fair hearings are already hard to come by in front of mostly volunteer juries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we want to avoid more situations like Caleb Warner’s, the OCR should rethink its mandate and find another, more principled way to prosecute sexual assault cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OCR must understand that making unwitting victims out of men like Caleb Warner does justice for no one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn attempting to fix the problem of sexual violence and misconduct, the OCR victimizes another class of people. Trading one set of victims for another does service to no one, especially when one of those victims is the Constitution of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— nperrino@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Editor\\'s Note: IDS reporter Sarah Hutchins analyzed Bloomington and IU police departments\\' records about all \"sex/rape\" crimes reported in the past 10 years and compared them with statistics from Bloomington\\'s Middle Way House, a non-profit domestic violence and rape crisis center. This story is based on interviews with experts and more than 700 police reports.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumbers can’t tell the whole story of sexual assault in Bloomington. They can’t describe the full-body shock a victim feels in the wake of an assault. They can’t include the hundreds of victims — mostly female, but also male — who don’t want to put their bodies on display for law enforcement or a jury. They can’t capture the lingering pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the numbers can still tell a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 700 people filed reports of sexual assault — a crime that includes rape, attempted rape and any form of unwanted sexual contact — with Bloomington and IU police departments in the past 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese crime reports, as well as information from Middle Way House, can shed light on a misunderstood crime. They can confront the confusion surrounding consent. They can discredit myths many of us have internalized from a young age.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe numbers give us strength. They can help us fight back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe healing system\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some victims choose to report sexual assault to a police agency, most survivors don’t use the legal system to heal. Compare Middle Way House statistics with those of local police, and the magnitude of underreporting becomes clear.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the Bloomington and IU police departments recorded 80 cases of sexual assault. During the same period of time, Middle Way House on-scene advocates responded to 291 calls. In 45 of those cases, an advocate counseled a victim in the emergency room.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dramatic difference in numbers helps explain why the U.S. Department of Justice has called sexual assault the most underreported crime in the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Middle Way House doesn’t distribute statistics about the number of victims who file a police report, crisis intervention services coordinator Tina Cornetta explained that many victims do not go to the police.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can understand why the legal system is not always conducive to healing,” Cornetta said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen victims ask about reporting an assault, Cornetta said, she explains how the case moves through the judicial system. Sometimes victims worry reporting will put them in more danger. In other cases, a survivor doesn’t want to go through the experience of explaining what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After you’ve experienced trauma it’s understandable that you don’t want to tell your story over and over again,” Cornetta said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an assault, Sexual Assault Crisis Service Counselor Ann Skirvin explained, the mind and body act to protect the victim. The mind can shut down, Skirvin said, and survivors can go into a state of shock. She compared the experience to standing on a frozen pond.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is anger and sadness under the ice, but you don’t have access to it,” Skirvin said. “It’s instinct to act like it never happened and move on.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese coping mechanisms can get in the way of reporting. Sometimes the speed at which police and prosecutors work isn’t right for a survivor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The general legal system doesn’t always work well in these cases,” Skirvin said. “It can work on a timeline that’s counter-intuitive to what’s healing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMonroe County Deputy Sex Crimes Prosecutor Rebecca Veidlinger said there are good reasons to report. Prior allegations of sexual assault have helped her negotiate plea deals in later cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even if she can’t file charges, Veidlinger said, the process of reporting can empower survivors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People are proud that they spoke up and did it for themselves,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA dangerous safe haven\\r\\n\\r\\nStories of strangers attacking women in the night characterize discussions of sexual assault, but maintaining these myths could put us at risk. \\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault finds us in the places we feel safe. It reaches into homes and offices. Reports show up from grocery stores, restaurants and even churches.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice reports show that the majority of sexual assaults don’t happen in parking garages or isolated areas. In 10 years, no one has reported a sexual assault in Dunn Woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssoc. Dean of Students  Carol McCord said she’s witnessed parents and students perpetuate false ideas of sexual assault. Earlier this year — after reports of several sexual assaults appeared in the media — parents called McCord to express concern about the safety of their daughters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCord told them the University was worried about the spike in reported crimes, but that she was equally concerned about the risk all college women face among their own group of friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Parents were mad when I said that,” McCord said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the parents said they didn’t want to talk about girls who get drunk and make decisions they regret, she said. They saw acquaintance rape — the most common form of sexual assault — as a lesser crime, one undeserving of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can put out more lights and I can put out more police,” McCord said. “What I can’t do is change the cultural attitudes people have about this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the emergency blue lights around campus haven’t been used to alert police about an assault in at least 10 years, McCord said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lights and buttons were designed to help people feel safer and make students aware of their surroundings. However, their placement in isolated areas furthers myths about where assaults take place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I could put a blue light in every bedroom,” McCord said, “maybe I would get somewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFriends and strangers\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of sexual assaults take place among acquaintances, and many of these crimes come down to a question of consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighty percent of reported sexual assaults in Bloomington were perpetrated by acquaintances, while only 20 percent involved strangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice reports describe boyfriends holding down and raping girlfriends, employees groping coworkers and husbands assaulting wives.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeneath the surfaces of these cases lies the question — or confusion — of consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne woman told police she was raped by an acquaintance “with whom she’d had consensual sex in the past.” According to the police report, when police talked to the suspect, he didn’t deny they had sex but argued it was consensual.\\r\\n\\r\\nKristen Jozkowski studies consent as a Ph.D. candidate in applied health science. She said men and women interpret consent in fundamentally different ways.\\r\\nWomen, Jozkowski said, view consent as a verbal agreement. Men, on the other hand, interpret consent as a woman not saying no or not fighting their advances. For them, actions imply consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile most of the men who participated in Jozkowski’s consent studies understood the legal definition of the term — and necessity of verbal consent — many worried that bringing up the topic would make sex awkward.\\r\\n\\r\\nA small group, however, saw it differently. If you ask a woman about consent, they told Jozkowski, you give her an opportunity to say no.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no such thing as “kind of” giving consent. As Rebecca Veidlinger, the deputy sex crimes prosecutor, explained, consent is not a one-time action.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just because I gave you $10 today doesn’t mean you can steal $10 later,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcerpts from cases\\r\\n\\r\\nSTRANGER\\r\\n\\r\\n “25-year-old female states that she was walking from her apartment to another apartment when a male subject pulled her from behind and raped her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A 21-year-old female reports an attempted sexual battery. Victim stated that while she was walking, an unknown white male grabbed her, knocked her to the ground and attempted to remove her clothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nACQUAINTANCE\\r\\n\\r\\n“18-year-old female reports going to a party and then going into a male’s apartment where they were making out. She told him that she did not want to have intercourse, but he forced himself on her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Female, age 21, reported she was sexually assaulted by a male acquaintance. The female advised the male was to drive her home, but instead drove her to his residence where the assault occurred.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“26-year-old male reports he passed out at an acquaintance’s residence and woke up to find the suspect performing oral sex on him. He believed he may have been drugged while out drinking with this suspect.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“34-year-old female reports an acquaintance she had invited into her residence grabbed her and forced her into a bedroom and raped her. She continually told him no and that she did not want to have sex. Officers located the suspect who stated the sex was consensual.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWho can I call?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the accused is an IU student:\\r\\nUse the campus judicial system by calling the Office of Student Ethics and Anti-Harrassment Programs at 812-855-5419.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I want to complete a rape kit:\\r\\nGo to the IU Health Bloomington Hospital or IU Health Center. You do not need to report a crime to have a forensic exam (also called a rape kit). Evidence collected through the exam can be stored anonymously for up to one year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I want a counselor:\\r\\nSet up an appointment at the Sexual Assault Crisis Service by calling 812-855-5711 or use the 24-hour crisis line: 812-855-8900.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Last week, Carole Markin sued online dating site Match.com, alleging she was assaulted by a man she met on the site. In her lawsuit, Markin claims the crime could have been avoided if Match.com screened its members against national sex offender registries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man Markin met on Match.com may be found guilty in a pending trial of having committed felonies of oral copulation and sexual battery. He has pleaded not guilty and claimed his relationship with her was consensual. Regardless of whether he is exonerated, the Editorial Board believes that Match.com cannot be responsible for investigating its members’ felony histories.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Match.com agreed this week to the background checks requested by Markin, the dating website made a mistake by relying on incorrect assumptions. The decision to disqualify sex offenders from membership will result in extensive negative consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, this entire case provides a perfect illustration of what is wrong with sex offender registries. Once published online, they become a way to punish offenders indefinitely, excluding them from a growing list of activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, Markin’s lawsuit misplaces the responsibility for the crime. Match.com does not bear the responsibility for the alleged assault. If found guilty, the assaulter himself bears full responsibility for his actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, the language of Markin’s suit promotes the falsehood that only women are the victims of sex crimes. Time reported that Markin’s lawsuit claimed, “Match and sexual predators benefit, while female members ... are endangered.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the website, there is no reason to identify and stigmatize everyone who has been convicted of a sex crime. Defined broadly, sex crimes can extend from the trivial public exposure to truly serious and reprehensible crimes such as child molestation and rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, in an age in which sex offender registries are published online, Markin could have independently investigated her date. Indeed, it was just such a search after the alleged assault that led her to discover that she had been matched with a convicted sex offender.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis would have been equally, if not more, effective than relying on Match.com to screen its members. The dating service’s president even cautioned that women should not believe that the new screens will make meeting dating partners online a completely safe process.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth, it is hard to see how the site should be required to research and provide information about a person’s classification as a sex offender if the website does not investigate other publicly available information about people’s criminal histories.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people would probably be more hesitant to spend time with a convicted murderer than a person convicted of urinating in public.\\r\\n\\r\\nDating strangers is inherently risky. Unfortunately, Match.com’s concession to Markin will not increase dating safety and will shift responsibility for sexual assault from its perpetrators to networking facilitators.',\n",

Collins later stated that if evidence exists that proves it was not murder, it is Winkle’s job to disprove that evidence as well.\\r\\nFinally, Collins asked the potential jurors, “Do you think every time somebody kills somebody, is it considered murder?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter different responses, Collins informed the jurors, who knew little or nothing about the trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What if I told you we are disputing that Michael Griffin stabbed Don Belton to death?” Collins said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSilence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now you want to know why.

       "  'body': 'Walk around campus today, and you may be prompted to “ask me why I’m wearing black.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThursdays in Black will promote solidarity and sexual assault awareness by encouraging students to wear black every Thursday in April. The joint project was organized by the IU Student Association’s Department of Women’s Affairs; Raising Awareness of Interactions in Sexual Encounters; the Office for Women’s Affairs; and the Women’s Student Association.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the clock tower by Woodburn Hall, students from these organizations handed out black T-shirts with electric blue writing inviting others to “ask” about their meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And if someone asks why you’re wearing black, you tell them, ‘Hey, we’re trying to stand up as a campus and a community against sexual violence,’” said senior Kolby Harrell, a member of RAISE.\\r\\n\\r\\nApril is National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Harrell said RAISE has been practicing Thursdays in Black in April for as long as he has been involved. This year, he said he sees the joint effort as a way to connect a variety of student organizations that are working toward a common goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers handed out pledge cards as well. These included facts about sexual assault, contacts for resources and further information about RAISE and WSA and three pledge points describing the statement volunteers will make by wearing the shirts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pledge cards state that by wearing shirts, volunteers are acknowledging that sexual activity without consent is always sexual assault, that sexual assault is a serious problem on our campus and that they will help end assault by always asking for consent and encouraging others to do the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to www.stopcampusrape.net, Thursdays in Black began at IU in 2004. Similar events can be found as far away as New Zealand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think this is really easy for somebody to do. You don’t have to have every fact straight — you just make yourself visible,” WSA president and junior Jenna Graham said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIUSA Chief of Women’s Affairs and senior Sarah Robinson said the organization chose to sponsor the event this year as a show of support.\\r\\n\\r\\n“IUSA as a student government at IU takes this issue seriously and wants to point out the other work that smaller groups are doing in the community,” Robinson said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobinson said RAISE, Sexual Assault Crisis Service and the Monroe County Prosecutor’s Office will be sponsoring 10 sessions of the program “Blame it on the Alcohol? The Truths, Myths and Laws of Sexual Assault” during April.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It doesn’t hurt to be safe,” junior Caitlyn Evans said, recalling the instances of campus rape reported this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nSophomore Claire Robinson said she looked forward to seeing the results today.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it will be a cool, unified response of students if it works,” Robinson said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Last March, former student Hai “Howie” Yu was charged with raping a female student and dragging her half-naked body out of the Foster Residence Center. On Wednesday, the rape charges were dropped and he pleaded guilty to reduced charges of sexual battery and criminal confinement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the plea agreement was announced in court, deputy prosecutor Rebecca Veidlinger told the judge that the victim, who appeared in court, had been\\r\\nconsulted about the new charges and supported the resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” Monroe Circuit Judge Teresa Harper said. “I would have had serious concerns and misgivings about this agreement had I not been aware that the victim in this case feels that this is an appropriate decision.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSince his arrest, Yu has lived under house arrest in Bloomington. On Wednesday, he arrived at the Justice Building \\xad— holding the door open for an elderly woman on the way in — and sat quietly in the hallway, head hung.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring questioning from his attorney and Veidlinger, Yu was never directly questioned about intercourse. However, he confirmed he had touched and kissed the victim. He also said he knew she was highly intoxicated that night.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would you agree that her level of intoxication rendered her mentally disabled or deficient?” Veidlinger asked Yu.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And that mental disability or deficiency prevented her from being able to consent to that touching?” Veidlinger asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYu’s case was scheduled for a jury trial starting March 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nWitnesses who saw Yu and the victim at various points throughout the evening of March 11, shed light on what happened through police reports and interviews with the Indiana Daily Student.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night started with a party and ended with a woman in the hospital and possible sexual assault changes. IU Student Association election results had been counted that day, and the numbers were official by the evening: iUnity, the party Yu was affiliated with as the 2009-10 Foster Residence Center representative to the IUSA Congress, won. Many of the campaign’s members, including Yu and the victim, were celebrating the victory at Phi Gamma Delta.\\r\\n\\r\\niUnity members said they didn’t notice anything unusual about Yu or the victim that night. Few knew him personally and one member said he had never met Yu before. Junior Farihah Hossain said she saw the victim drinking, but noted that she was with friends and nothing seemed wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, police said security videos captured Yu dragging the woman across the deck of the fraternity toward the parking lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the night, a sober driver told police the victim was leaning against Yu, her knees buckling as they waited for a ride. The driver told police he questioned Yu about the woman’s identity and where she lived. Yu told the driver she lived in a sorority, but to take them both to Foster so he would be able to take care of her. During the trip back, the woman sat limp and silent in the car.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The sorority was not the best place for her now,” Yu allegedly told the driver.\\r\\nPolice said they also checked surveillance cameras from Foster. According to a report, video footage showed Yu dragging a fully clothed woman who was “not moving under her own power” toward the west door of Foster-Magee.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout an hour later, the security camera captured Yu dragging the woman out of the same door. This time, police said, she was naked from the waist down.\\r\\n\\r\\nJunior Mackenzie Kelley told the IDS she was getting a ride home from a party with several other girls when she saw Yu drag the woman toward a dumpster. The woman was unconscious, she said, and missing pants.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you need help?” Kelley remembered yelling to Yu from the car window.\\r\\n“No,” he said. “It’s OK. I’ve got it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter getting out of the car to try and help the woman, Kelley told Yu they needed to call the police.\\r\\n\\r\\nIUPD officers who responded to the call took the victim to Bloomington Hospital, where she was treated for bruises and a spleen injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, police questioned and arrested Yu at the Indianapolis International Airport.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Long Island native was getting ready to board a flight back to New York for spring break. While investigators originally feared he was fleeing, Yu later explained he had purchased the ticket a month in advance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his arrest, IUSA removed Yu from Congress, IU officials announced he was no longer a student, and he was placed under house arrest with a GPS ankle monitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nYu is scheduled to be sentenced March 24.',\n",

       "  'body': 'We’re hustled near the arboretum, chased down near the steps of Ballantine, and aggressively stalked with clipboards near the Sample Gates. “Sign a petition,” we’re begged. “You don’t have to give any money.” So we sign and walk away feeling good (albeit slightly violated by their persistence) that we declared our commitment to the cause of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew petitions circulated around campus get enough signatures to reach their final destination: a small check box on OneStart’s “optional service fees” page during class registration. As a result, we rarely have to decide whether or not we want to cough up $5 for the cause we proudly signed our name in support of.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd who can blame us for holding onto our money? We scrimp and save and take out loans for ever-increasing tuition. Then we’re faced with $451.75 in mandatory student fees that go to activities, the Health Center, transportation, and technology. So when it comes to volunteering our hard-earned dough for “optional service fees,” it’s easy to just say no. In fact, it’s difficult to think of a reason to say yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it wasn’t always easy to look the other way. Before the 2005-2006 school year, students had to select “yes” or “no” for every optional fee. When registration technology changed, so did the yes/no option. The default choice became no, and students had to check a box only if they wanted to pay for an optional fee.\\r\\n\\r\\nSarah Robinson, IUSA director of women’s affairs, organizes the optional Sexual Assault Prevention Fund (formerly the Rape Crisis Fund). She says the fund prospered before the system change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the technology changed, the fate of optional fees wasn’t hard to predict. As former Dean of Students Richard McKaig warned the Indiana Daily Student in 2005, “We’re making it too easy to ignore the check-offs.” As predicted, donations to the Sexual Assault Prevention Fund plummeted. The fund steadily declined ever since.\\r\\nToday, getting a cause on the optional fees page is about more than raising money. Optional fees require student involvement (gathering 10,000 signatures and, once on the list, allocating the money). They ask that students make an investment in the future of the University.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the past two or three years, student groups have rallied to collect enough signatures to get a sustainability fund on the menu of optional fees, says Jacob Bower-Bir, logistics chair of the Student Sustainability Council. Every time, their efforts failed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis fall, however, a group of 19 student organizations on campus came together under the Student Sustainability Council to achieve this goal. Starting next fall, students will have the option to donate $5 toward campus sustainability initiatives.\\r\\nJust getting the signatures is a milestone, Bower-Bir says, but it’s only a small part of the recipe for a fund’s success. Students not only need to donate, but they need to get involved in the process of spending the funds.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re not buying absolution,” Bower-Bir says. “You’re buying responsibility.”\\r\\nIt’s easy to donate $5 to a cause and then relax knowing that someone else will solve the problem. But that’s not what a student fund is about, Bower-Bir says.\\r\\nStudents propose and organize student funds. If students think the University needs solar panels, that’s where the money will go.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile a quarter of the student population backed the petition to add sustainability to the optional fees list, Bower-Bir knows that even the best funds can quickly lose momentum.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeed proof? The $3 sexual assault prevention fund once collected $27,500 a year. The technology change, coupled with a lack of awareness, caused the balance to drop to $12,041 by 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, it’s up to us, the tired, cash-strapped, stressed-out students in the process of signing up for classes. We have to take the time to check a box.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe $3 or $5 we give to a fund might not manifest in something as tangible as a yearbook or gym locker. But what we get in return, Bower-Bir argues, is much greater. “The $5 investment will pay way more than $5 in dividends.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what do we get for our money? We get the satisfaction of knowing our friends are learning how to prevent sexual assault. We get the satisfaction of knowing that our campus will be a better place for the next generation of students. And we get the satisfaction of knowing we invested in the future of our University.',\n",

Two days later, he was dead and accused of sexually assaulting the man who killed him.Did Griffin and his lawyers use a controversial legal tactic known as the “gay panic defense” to get a lighter sentence for the crime?THAT DECEMBER MORNING, a snow had fallen. It dampened the sounds of a town already muted by the mass departure of IU students who had headed home for winter break. It was especially quiet at the home of assistant writing professor Don Belton when his colleague and friend Debra Kang Dean crunched her way through the snow and knocked on his front door.Dean had promised to housesit for Belton while he was visiting a friend in Hawaii, but she hadn’t heard from him since a phone call the previous afternoon. They had been talking about how she could get his house keys when Belton suddenly hung up, saying he would contact her later.That was shortly before 4 p.m., Dec. 27, 2009. He never called back, and when Dean had called him later that evening, Belton had not picked up. She checked his house, and no one answered her knock at the door.Now it was the next morning, and she was again standing on the porch of Belton’s pale yellow, one-floor house. She knocked and tried the doorbell again. He didn’t seem to be home. Dean peered through the front window and could see into the kitchen.Belton was lying on the tile floor. The door was unlocked and Dean rushed inside.“Don?” she asked, but he didn’t answer.A pool of blood swirled around his head and matted his short dreadlocks. His hands were palms up. His head was face down.Dean called 911.“I’m sorry,” she said into the phone, before yelling out to her friend again. “Don? Oh my God. I just came into my friend’s house and he’s on the floor with blood all over.”Officers from the Bloomington Police Department soon arrived at the home. In Belton’s bedroom, they saw an open suitcase on his bed, empty and ready to be packed. They observed blood not only in the kitchen, but also in the living room and office.Throughout the house, they found stacks and shelves of books, including several journals. In the most recent volume, the detectives read an entry about how happy Belton was that a man had recently come into his life. The man’s name was Michael. On a 4×6 index card were directions to the man’s house.Police soon arrested 25-year-old Michael Griffin and charged him with killing Belton. Griffin would even confess to the crime. There was no doubt, reasonable or otherwise: at his trial, all sides would agree that the former marine had killed the writing professor.But was he a murderer?THE QUESTION EMERGED with Griffin’s defense, piggybacking on an accusation against a dead man. Griffin told police that Belton assaulted him two days before the killing. Belton’s death, therefore, came in a moment of rage that was a result of that assault.The allegation shocked those who knew and worked with the professor, a man who allegedly abhorred violence \\xad— when students visited him they were greeted by Buddhist quotes tacked to his office door. Belton’s friends began to worry that Griffin’s lawyers were preparing to use a controversial legal tactic. Their fears were seemingly confirmed when a cbsnews.com headline asked, “Did ‘Gay Panic’ Lead Ex-Marine Michael Griffin to Kill Professor Don Belton?”The gay panic defense, as it is casually called, is not actually a legal defense at all.“It’s not an officially recognized defense that’s on the books, but the term is often used as a shorthand for various strategies under a plea, say, of temporary insanity or self-defense or some kind of diminished capacity,” said IU professor Alyce Miller, a lawyer and a friend of Belton’s who testified at Griffin’s trial.The assault or murder of a gay or lesbian person can then be chalked up to retaliation or self-defense against their sexual advances. When dealing with such an advance, the argument goes, a panic sets in, leading the suspect to commit manslaughter, not murder.It has its roots in an obscure, and presumably outdated, psychiatric disorder called acute homosexual panic, or Kempf’s Disease, named after the psychiatrist who penned the term in the 1920s. It is described as “an acute severe attack of anxiety based on unconscious conflicts involving gender identity.”Julia Heiman, director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, said gay panic should carry no weight as a legal defense.“Defining it, as well as believing that it inspires murder, would take a leap of imagination rather than facts,” Heiman said. Yet, gay panic keeps popping up in courtrooms.It was famously used during the early days of the Matthew Shepard case in Wyoming in 1998, though it was later abandoned. Since 2004, the defense has been used successfully in at least six states. Its success is indiscriminate of locale — from the mistrial of a California teenager who shot a classmate twice in the head, to the 180-day-sentence of a Washington D.C. man whose victim lay in coma for ten days before dying.In 2009, Joseph Biedermann was acquitted of a first-degree murder in Illinois after he said his victim had made unwanted sexual advances toward him. Biedermann stabbed the man 61 times.In 2008, Coleman King and Garrett Gray brutally beat Aaron “Shorty” Hall to death and dumped his body near a Jackson County, Ind., cornfield after he allegedly hit on them. Hall was kicked, punched and left naked in a ditch to die. The court accepted the men’s pleas of manslaughter.Under Indiana law, someone who is guilty of manslaughter is a “person who knowingly or intentionally: kills another human being; or kills a fetus that has attained viability; while acting under sudden heat.” The existence of sudden heat, a momentary explosion of uncontrollable rage or panic, reduces what would otherwise be murder to voluntary manslaughter. It also reduces the sentence.“Shorty” Hall’s killers received a 30-year-sentence and will likely serve just half of that in prison.Though Griffin’s defense team would never actually utter the phrase “gay panic,” all of its elements were there in the team’s developing argument. There was the hope for a manslaughter verdict. There was the straight man alleging a gay man assaulted him.And there was the claim that the killing happened under sudden heat. \\r\\n BY THE TIME Don Belton left his hometown of Philadelphia and began teaching at IU in 2008, he was already a respected author and academic. He frequently explored themes of identity, sexuality and perceived masculinity — all issues at the heart of his own murder — through his writing.He became known for his work tackling these issues with the publication of his 1986 novel, “Almost Midnight.” In 1996, he edited a well-received collection of essays and stories called “Speak My Name: Black Men on Masculinity and the American Dream.” He read and taught in France, Brazil, Ireland, Italy and the Ivory Coast.By all accounts, Belton was successful, though he didn’t always feel it. He wrote about a “soul-sick sadness” he inherited from his father and his father’s father. It was the kind of sadness he felt from being an African American who had once worked at a college that had not granted tenure to a black professor in 20 years.While his writing often addressed contentious issues, Belton’s friends and colleagues said he hated confrontation and violence. Mara Miller, a friend of Belton’s for a decade, said he was extremely peaceful. It was Miller who Belton was going to visit in Hawaii, and she spent days after his death wondering why her friend never arrived at Honolulu International Airport. She described Belton as a man who avoided confrontation even in the face of racism and homophobia.“He was incapable of violent behavior,” she said.MICHAEL GRIFFIN WAS born and raised in Bloomington. He attended Bloomington High School South before joining the United States Marine Corps in 2002. Before he was deployed to Iraq, he bought a 10-inch, double-edged knife called a Peace Keeper. He carried it with him during his tour, using it to intimidate insurgents in Fallujah.Griffin became a machine gunner and lance corporal. Later, an Improvised Explosive Device ripped apart both his right eardrum and one of his best friends. The explosion also sent shrapnel tearing into his leg, leaving him partially disabled. Griffin earned a Purple Heart and returned home without killing anyone.“I came back clean,” he later said.Back in Bloomington, Griffin sought rehab for his disabilities as well as counseling with a local Veterans Affairs support group. He became a father, though the romance with the child’s mother did not last.Later, he began dating a young woman named Jessica Greiwe, and the couple carved out a sustainable lifestyle in New Unionville, a nearby township about five miles from IU’s campus.They grew their own vegetables and raised chickens — food that, in part, would be served at spirited, debate-filled dinner parties. He frequented Rachael’s Café, an open-minded and inclusive coffee shop owned and operated by a transgender woman, who they sometimes invited over for dinner.He still often carried his Peace Keeper, tucked into a sheath on his belt.BELTON’S AND GRIFFIN’S paths first crossed in 2009.At a local gift store called Athena, they struck up a conversation about the Iraq War. Belton was impressed to learn that the former marine now had an antiwar stance. The two later ran into each other again at the Monroe County Public Library. When Belton’s birthday arrived, Griffin and Greiwe invited the professor over for dinner.According to Belton’s colleagues, Griffin and Greiwe did yard work for various members of the English faculty, and they spoke fondly of the professor. A few months later, Griffin helped Belton move some furniture from the IU Surplus Store to his home.In December, they invited Belton to Christmas dinner. Griffin’s sister, Rita, and her boyfriend also came over. They ate a large meal, drank rum sidecars, smoked marijuana and played the game Apples to Apples, Griffin later said.At one point, he gave Belton a tarot card reading, drawing the “transformation” card, otherwise known as the “death” card. This seemed to concern Belton, according to Griffin’s testimony. He told the professor not to worry.The “transformation” card can mean many things, Griffin said, not only death.With the final hours of Christmas waning, Rita and her boyfriend left. Belton settled into a recliner to watch a movie, telling the couple he was too drunk and high to make it home. Griffin and Greiwe laid down on a bed in the living room. Griffin later said that he soon passed out and has no memory of the rest of the night.Greiwe later testified that, despite blacking out repeatedly, she remembered much of what happened between the two men. Belton and Griffin had sex multiple times, she said. Twice she saw them having anal sex, as well as oral sex. While she said that she doesn’t recall Griffin struggling, she said he was heavily intoxicated.The next morning, a Saturday, the three shared breakfast together before Belton went home.On Sunday, Griffin and Greiwe ate at Muddy Boots Cafe in Nashville, Ind., and hiked the Tecumseh Trail in nearby Morgan County with some friends. Griffin brought his Peace Keeper with him.After returning home, Griffin decided to run some errands. As he neared Belton’s side of town, he later said, he felt compelled to visit the professor to talk about what happened Christmas night. Griffin parked a block away and walked to Belton’s house. Belton was in his driveway discussing travel plans over the phone with someone but motioned for Griffin to follow him inside.It was shortly before 4 p.m., Dec. 27. Belton wrapped up the phone call and got Griffin a glass of water from the kitchen.What happened next is only known by two people. One of them is dead. The other is his killer. Griffin later testified that the two exchanged heated words about the sexual encounter, which led to a shoving match. Griffin drew the 10-inch blade still tucked in his belt. Then, he testified, he blacked out.“I remember that we were fighting and remember we stopped fighting,” Griffin said. “He lurched forward and I saw what I had done.”He stabbed Belton 21 times and, according to medical examiner and forensic pathologist Dr. Roland Kohr, “half-heartedly” attempted to slit his throat. At one point, Griffin even stabbed Belton and then rotated the knife 45 degrees before removing it. He nearly severed Belton’s pulmonary artery.Griffin wiped the knife on Belton’s corduroy pants and ran to his truck. He sat in the driver’s seat, shaking, before catching sight of himself in his rear view mirror. He saw blood on his face, shirt and pants. Outside his truck, snow was falling. Griffin wiped his face clean and changed into some clothes he had in his vehicle.Then he returned some DVDs to the Monroe County Public Library and bought some water at Bloomingfoods Market and Deli. He also drove to see his sister. She had left her scarf at his house. She asked for a ride to her friend’s, and Griffin obliged.“Please don’t be scared,” he told her as they drove. “But I just killed somebody.”Rita didn’t know what to say, and Griffin dropped her off at her friend’s house. As he handed her the scarf, he later said, he remembered the bloody clothes that were now in a bag in his truck. He threw them in a dumpster near Pete Ellis Drive.When Griffin returned home, Greiwe could tell something was wrong with her boyfriend.He remained silent as his mind drifted back to two nights earlier when he tried calming Belton’s fears about the “death” card. He was wrong, Griffin said he now realized, showing his knife to Greiwe and confessing to killing Belton.“Sometimes,” he said, “death means death.”The following morning, Griffin used Greiwe’s phone to call Belton’s, attempting to create the illusion that the pair thought the professor was still alive. Later, while Griffin remained at home with his young son, Greiwe visited her parents in Batesville, Ind. After taking a nightmare-filled nap, she told her parents everything. Greiwe’s father drove her to the Batesville Police Department where she wrote a statement. The Batesville police called the Bloomington police.That evening, Griffin was having trouble putting his son to bed. The boy wouldn’t go to sleep, and he kept kissing his father on the cheek.“Why are you being so sweet,” Griffin asked before noticing lights outside.Then his door was kicked open and his windows were smashed in. A Bloomington Police tactical team stormed into the house. He was thrown onto the ground and his wrists were zip-tied in the same way Griffin was trained to detain insurgents in Iraq.His son was taken away, and he was arrested for murder.\\r\\n THREE DAYS AFTER his death, some of Belton’s former students created a blog called “Justice For Don Belton” to follow the case and dispel any malicious rumors about the professor as the manslaughter defense materialized.In the blog’s comments section, a portrait emerged of a man who was a lover of jazz and Diana Ross, who would stop to pick a flower even when running late for class, who was starting a new, secure chapter of his life in a tenure-tracked position after years of insecurity and setbacks, including the death of his parents and a brother.Soon after he was killed, IU Provost Karen Hanson released a statement about Belton, calling his death a “terrible loss.” The next PRIDE LGBTQ Film Festival in Bloomington was dedicated to Belton. Readings of his work took place around town. A New Years Day vigil attracted more than 100 shivering mourners who stood holding candles in the cold.\\r\\nBut not all members of the community were as mournful.In a blog post titled “The Standard for Assistant Profs at the IU Dept. of English,” Kelley School of Business professor Eric Rasmusen took Belton’s murder as an opportunity to criticize the University’s hiring process, making sure to point out the races and nationalities of instructors who did not have doctoral degrees, including the dead professor. Comments on local newspapers’ websites revealed a handful of readers who couldn’t believe a former marine would have to go through a trial like this when it was an obvious case of self-defense.Bloomington is often at odds with the state, and even county, that surrounds it. On one hand, the city prides itself for having the “fifth largest per capita population of same-sex couples” and being “one of the most progressive cities in the Midwest, both socially and politically.” On the other, it is nestled in the center of a state that has no hate crime laws and, in general, an anti-gay political environment.In Indiana, gay men are 400 times more likely to become a victim of a hate crime than individuals associated with any other group, according to the state’s Civil Rights Commission.Like Belton’s friends, Griffin’s lawyers were also concerned about the publicity and whose peers would end up in the jury box.There were, in essence, two extreme narratives of the crime: that of a naive, war-damaged twenty-something manipulated and then abused by an intelligent, gay academic old enough to be his father; and that of an older, weaker writing professor who dared to look for love in the arms of a strong and subconsciously, but deeply homophobic former-marine.The defense asked that the case be moved to another county. The request was denied. \\r\\nGRIFFIN’S TRIAL BEGAN April 11, 2011. Justice for Don Belton bloggers sat among Griffin’s friends and family in the small courtroom.As expected, Griffin and public defenders David Collins and Phyllis Emerick argued that Belton sexually assaulted Griffin Christmas night 2009 following a drunken dinner party, and it was this attack that ultimately led to the professor’s unintended death.Under Indiana law, a sexual encounter without consent is only considered rape if it is between people of the opposite sex.“He sexually assaulted me, whatever you want to call it,” Griffin said, his square jaw shaking and his voice catching in his throat. “Rape.”When the argument about the sexual encounter got out of hand, Collins said, Griffin’s military training kicked in. This blinding, impulsive moment of sudden heat brought on by the alleged assault is what led to the professor’s death, he said. Griffin’s crime was not murder, the defense argued, but manslaughter.Deputy prosecutors Darcie Winkle and Bob Miller pointed out possible holes in the defense’s argument. Griffin had parked a block away and had arrived with a knife and a change of clothes. The change of clothes was a coincidence, Griffin said. It was a dirty outfit he still had in the vehicle from a trip earlier in the week.Griffin said his memory went blank at the two most crucial moments of the case, the prosecutors continued. Not only did he say he did not recall killing Belton, he also didn’t remember the alleged assault that led him to confront the professor.And about that confrontation: in a moment of what the defense called “sudden heat,” Griffin stabbed the professor 21 times.Of the multiple injuries, four of them could have been fatal, the medical examiner said. After a series of gruesome autopsy photographs were shown to illustrate the examiner’s report, Bob Miller asked him what the mechanism of death was.Blood loss and lack of oxygen, the examiner answered.The cause of death?Stab wounds to the chest and stomach.“And what was the manner of death?”“It was homicide.”Griffin, however, received no injuries during the struggle he described. Prior to his arrest, Griffin never went to the police with the allegations of assault, Winkle told the jurors, and he had 32 hours to decide what action he would take. The prosecution also made note of Griffin’s “arsenal” of nine knives and a gun that detectives had found at his house.“He killed Don Belton because he was humiliated,” Winkle said in her closing arguments, referring to the sexual encounter as a night of experimental group sex that Griffin later regretted. “For some reason he thought that he should be humiliated for what happened on the 25th. He killed Don Belton because of what happened on the 25th, not what happened there in the kitchen.”Michael Griffin, she said, is guilty of murder. \\r\\nTHE DELIBERATION LASTED 12 hours. When the jury returned to the courtroom, Griffin was already sitting inside, wearing a suit with his legs in shackles.Only three of Griffin’s supporters had managed to make it back in time for the late-night verdict. His sister, Rita, and two of his friends — one, who had raced to the Justice Building from work, was still wearing a Jimmy John’s delivery uniform — sat on a hard bench in the back of the room.The foreman handed the bailiff their verdict, and Judge Teresa Harper read it aloud: guilty of murder.Rita began to silently sob, her hands covering her mouth. As Griffin was led out of the room, his sister rushed toward the short swinging door that separated the siblings.“I love you, Michael,” she shrieked.Belton’s old friend Mara Miller ran into the courtroom and looked around, her eyes darting to the jury box, the judge, the screaming sister, trying to find a sign of what was decided. A reporter mouthed the word “guilty” to her, and she slumped onto the bench where Rita Griffin was sitting a moment earlier.“Oh,” Miller said, her hand over her chest. “Oh, thank God.” \\r\\nON MAY 17, 2011, Griffin was sentenced to 55 years in prison. He received credit for 505 days already served in the Monroe County Jail and another five years of his sentence will be served on probation.The following March, the Court of Appeals of Indiana shaved Griffin’s sentence down to 45 years, the minimum amount for murder. Griffin’s military service and his Purple Heart helped lead to the reduced sentence, the court said, as well as “the pervasive evidence that the homicide was in response to a sexual assault.”While it is impossible to know if Belton sexually assaulted Griffin, the “pervasive evidence” the court cites is solely Greiwe’s and Griffin’s recollections of Christmas night, both of the alleged assault and what the court considered to be hints at premeditation on Belton’s part.“Greiwe testified that Belton, a relatively new acquaintance, told her that he had no place to go for Christmas,” the court’s opinion reads. “Before dinner, he asked to spend the night ‘if he had too much to drink.’”It is difficult to pinpoint exactly how well Belton and Griffin were acquainted. Griffin and Greiwe maintain that they had only hung out with Belton a handful of times. It is clear that Griffin did know Belton at least as far back as prior to the professor’s 53rd birthday — nearly five months before the murder.Belton’s friends have said that the length of Griffin’s sentence is somewhat irrelevant as no number of years will resurrect the professor. The decision behind the reduced sentence, however, is a different story.“Symbolically, what the Appeals Court did is unconscionable, and I see it as a slap in the face at the original trial judge and prosecutors and jury,” Alyce Miller said.Griffin will now be eligible for parole in 20 years or less. He will be a younger man than Belton was at the time of his death. While Griffin’s claim that Belton sexually assaulted him did not result in a voluntary manslaughter verdict, it did result in a similar sentence.Griffin will likely serve just five more years in prison than those who killed “Shorty” Hall – two men who were actually found guilty of manslaughter after successfully using the “gay panic defense.”AFTER BELTON’S DEATH, the Lilly Library acquired hundreds of artifacts from his life. The collection fills 36 boxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boxes contain journals, books, correspondence with authors such as James Baldwin, an alligator head clutching index cards in its jaws, old newspaper clippings, recorded interviews, sketches, photographs, a string-less violin and a cracker tin containing some squirt guns.The boxes hold nearly all of Belton’s material life — from a sixth grade class photo, to folders of students’ work, to a jar of unspent coins. It’s the writing professor’s past, frozen present and unreached future, all locked away in a library’s annex.Griffin will serve his sentence locked away at the Wabash Valley Correctional Facility.Incidentally, Alyce Miller said, if Belton was still alive, it is likely he wouldn’t want to see Griffin imprisoned at all.“He had very strong feelings about incarcerating people,” Miller said. “He would see Michael as a victim, too.”',\n",

Lahr asked to start a Bloomington chapter and, after drafting a constitution, it was approved as a student chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I felt that all the organizations that I found focused on date rape and abuse, and I wanted to find an organization that was specifically focused on helping those who were sexually assaulted at a young age,” Lahr said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIU chapter’s secretary Kelsie Stanhope said this is a global issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a lot of people would necessarily think of this social issue on a daily basis,” Stanhope said. “But it is an incredibly important one, not only in our society but throughout the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough it’s a new organization on campus, Stop the Silence already has various events planned. It will organize many fundraising and awareness events throughout the year and spread awareness through the arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nA movie inspired by the organization, “To Kill a Kelpie,” was shown in Woodburn Hall 120 and was followed by a panel discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith 10 board members and 40 members on the mailing list already, Stop the Silence members are anticipating more people will join the Bloomington chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The best way to get involved with Stop the Silence would be to join the Facebook group, ‘Stop the Silence at Indiana University,’” Stanhope said.\\r\\nFor more information on Stop the Silence at IU, search “Stop the Silence at Indiana University” at myinvolvement.indiana.edu or contact jmlahr@indiana.edu.',\n",

       "  'body': 'IU’s Culture of Care, a program sponsored by the IU Student Association, received national attention after an interview with IUSA President Kyle Straub was published in O Magazine’s November issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt discussed the origin of Culture of Care and Straub’s willingness to expand the program from a Culture of Care Week last year to a long-standing initiative.\\r\\n\\r\\nCulture of Care week was in April, and Straub noted that the idea gained strong support from students and administrators. The next goal was to figure out where to take that momentum, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To actually change the culture of the University, we need a year-long campus effort,” said Katy Flanigan, codirector of the Culture of Care initiative.\\r\\n\\r\\nCulture of Care seeks to educate students concerning issues in four categories: mental health awareness, sexual assault, alcohol and drug abuse and discrimination.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A lot of instances have happened in the last few years that made us realize students need to learn when it is time to intervene,” Flanigan said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIUSA has pushed Culture of Care at a number of events, including the Jill Behrman 5K Run, the Out of the Darkness Walk and IU Dance Marathon. At each event, IUSA received the chance to speak or hand out information, water bottles and other promotional items to participants.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact of Culture of Care is hard to measure since it is an abstract concept, Flanigan said. Despite this, the Culture of Care steering committee makes sure that someone records quotes and takes pictures at each event to document progress for future Culture of Care leaders, she explained.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeslie Fasone is the adviser for the Culture of Care program and is also a doctoral student in health behaviors at the IU School of\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic Health. She has been at IU more than 10 years and said the movement is something she hasn’t seen before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The fact that the student leaders from various organizations are collaborating on these initiatives and are essentially creating a movement at IU is something that is new and exciting,” Fasone said in an email.  “I think that the Culture of Care is spreading in a number of ways, many of which we will never see or know about.” \\r\\n\\r\\nGetting students to speak about these issues is both the goal and largest setback of the Culture of Care program, Straub said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everything Culture of Care embodies is hard to speak about,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault and mental health issues, in particular, are considered taboo, Flanigan said. IUSA’s efforts seek to make it easier to discuss these topics. Teaching students how to respond appropriately to others who have these issues is a large part of this effort.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some ways people think are appropriate ways to respond are actually making the problems worse,” Straub said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the issues have been stigmatized for so long, Straub sees success in getting students to talk about them at all. Shifting an entire culture is a daunting and abstract feat, Fasone said, but she is optimistic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If anyone can change the culture, the students can,” she said. “IUDM just raised $2.1 million this past weekend. ... IU students are a powerful force.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Step Up! Initiative is one way IUSA hopes to fight the unwillingness and fear of students to intervene when other students are facing one of these issues, Fasone added. Step Up! focuses on talking to students about the reasons they don’t intervene and finding ways to overcome these barriers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these campus-wide efforts are necessary, Straub said, IUSA found it hard to shift its strategy to reach the most students in the most effective way.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Friday, Straub will participate in the Culture of Care summit, a meeting featuring the presidents and leaders of the 25 biggest student organizations on campus, in order to discuss the issues facing students.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re trying to target key influencers on our campus to try and embody this culture,” Straub said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeer-to-peer communication is the heart of the program, he said, and he feels it is more effective than having administrators “talk down” to students on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Studies have shown that this kind of stuff does work, but we’ll just have to see,” he said. “It’s a lot of trial and error, but we’re trying.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCulture of Care is still in its beginning stages, and Straub said he recognizes the difficulties at hand. He hopes others won’t be discouraged by this struggle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s definitely an uphill battle, especially at IU,” he said. “Pretty much everything we are doing is not easy, but it is important to confront these issues and get people talking.”',\n",

He could be released sooner, if he continues his education while incarcerated.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast week, Griffin’s sentence was reduced to 45 years after the court weighed in Griffin’s claim that he was sexually assaulted by Belton two days prior to the murder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In light of the tragic circumstances surrounding the offense and the character of the offender as he conducted himself prior to the instant aberration, we find a 45-year sentence to be appropriate,” the court ruling states.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sentence reduction comes in response to the implication that the murder was instigated by a sexual assault, according to the ruling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chain of events that transpired prior to the murder began at a party in December 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelton invited himself to a Christmas party hosted by Griffin and his girlfriend. Belton disclosed at the party that he was either too high or drunk to get home safely, according to the Indiana Court of Appeals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point in the night, Griffin had consumed an abundance of alcohol and was extremely intoxicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelton reportedly took advantage of the situation and engaged Griffin in unwanted oral and anal sex, the case summary reads.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few days later, Griffin drove to Belton’s Madison Street home to confront his alleged attacker. The confrontation turned violent, and Griffin stabbed Belton 21 times with his 10-inch combat blade and slashed his throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonroe County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Bob Miller presided over the case and stands by the original sentence handed down last year by Monroe Circuit Judge Teresa Harper.\\r\\n\\r\\n— Michael Majchrowicz',\n",

       "  'body': 'Jackie Daniels is now helping college students who are struggling with problems similar to the ones she had as an undergraduate at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels, who now has her master’s degree and license in social work, dropped out of college in 2000.She was in treatment for addiction by 22.\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels received her master’s degree in 2005, but has been working in the field of mental health and addictions for more than 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is now the interim director for the Office of Alternative Screening and Intervention Services. Along with 18 interns and staff members, she meets with students who violated the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Conduct or who independently seek help.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We see mandated students, but we also want to open our doors for people that are on the whole continuum of drinking, worried about a friend, worried about a family member or experiencing a problem themselves and need help,” Daniels said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in 2003, OASIS is IU-Bloomington’s centralized office for alcohol prevention and intervention. The office works with other campus offices as part of an effort to address college drinking, particularly binge drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the 2011 Indiana Collegiate Substance Use Survey, 29.3 percent of IU-Bloomington students reported binge drinking one to two times during the preceding two weeks.23.9 percent reported doing so more than three times.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, 30 to 50 percent of students were not binge drinking on a regular basis. Binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks in one sitting for females and five or more drinks for males.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 90 percent of the students who come to OASIS for a counseling appointment are conduct cases, Daniels said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll students receive a survey to fill out as part of the assessment process. This screening is a way to evaluate the level of risk they have. The first session typically lasts an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe OASIS intern or staff member reviews the survey and develops a relationship with the student.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not just about alcohol,” Daniels said. “It is about their life as a student and about their values and what they believe in and what they want to accomplish as a student. What kind of beliefs they had coming in dictates what they did once they got here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels said she personally struggled in college with who she was on a Saturday night versus who she was on a Wednesday morning in class.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My values of who I believed I was and how I was living my life didn’t match up,” she said. “That is a lot of the conversation we have with students. You say your family and friends are really important to you, but when you black out, you leave your friends. Why is there a disconnect? Why do your values not apply on a Saturday night? That is exactly how I was. It was very easy to forget about the things that were important to me, and I developed a problem.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it was a coincidence at first, Daniels said once she started her job and was talking to a student, her personal connection to her work clicked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was talking to a student, and I was like this sounds like me when I was 20 or 21, and I realized on a very personal level,” she said. “And it was eye opening to me that I wasn’t just doing a job but something that I am physically and spiritually linked to.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels said she thinks it is easy for students to feel lost when they start college.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You want it to be the best four years of your life, but you don’t realize that all your years after college are going to be the best years of your life too,” she said.\\r\\n“I think that I felt the desire to help students who were in a similar position to mine, but that is 2 percent of the students we see who have a true substance abuse or addiction problem.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels said she hopes the harm of the presence of alcohol and drugs can be\\r\\nreduced.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No student should lose their life when they decide to go to college for four years,” she said. “It is just pointless and I don’t want it to happen. I think there is something we can all do before that happens. I want students to know we are there as a resource before a friend dies or a friend overdoses or is sexually assaulted.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Erin Biebuyck combed the shelves at the Monroe County Public Library.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe searched IU’s online library system.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing there, either.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiebuyck began work in January as a woman’s advocate at Middle Way House, a shelter and advocacy organization for individuals who have experienced domestic violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiebuyck’s background was in history, gender and sexuality. She didn’t know how to talk to women who had lived in a cycle of control and submission. She didn’t know how to relate to people who had seen their children beaten or verbally assaulted, knowing they were next. She wasn’t sure how to encourage people to escape their own homes safely.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe became determined to learn. But there were no books.\\r\\nShe’s about to change that.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiebuyck and Lindsay Lauver, a May IU graduate and intern at Middle Way, began a program called Pages for Change on Aug. 1. The program will raise money to purchase books addressing domestic violence. They will be distributed to local and university libraries in the six Indiana counties Middle Way serves, Monroe, Morgan, Owen, Lawrence, Greene and Martin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiebuyck and Lauver selected 20 books covering both general and specific topics, Biebuyck said. They outline how to leave an abuser safely and to whom survivors can turn. Some are targeted toward specific groups.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have one that’s bilingual in English and Spanish,” Biebuyck said. “We have another for African-American women, and one for women of south Asian origin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said some of the selected books target individuals of high socioeconomic status.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People usually assume domestic violence happens among the poor or uneducated,” Beibuyck said. “We learn that’s not the case, and there’s a lot of shame, regardless.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBiebuyck and Lauver have a fundraising goal of $9,000, which they are collecting through a website supported by startsomegood.com. They want to reach this goal by\\r\\nSept. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith $9,000, Biebuyck said she would be able to purchase two sets of the 20 books for each library, which they would buy during the last two weeks of September and distribute by Oct. 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and Lauver have set a “tipping point” of $3,000. If this smaller goal is not reached, the money raised will return to donors, Biebuyck said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe smaller goal will allow the project to succeed even if Biebuyck’s best case scenario of $9,000 is not realized, she said. The deadline for the smaller goal is also Sept. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fundraising website asks supporters to donate between $15 and $1,000.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A lot of people we know are students trying to make ends meet,” Biebuyck said. “But Lindsay and I thought, ‘I could donate $20.’ So I like this method.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless, Biebuyck said she and Lauver will purchase the books and distribute them by October, which is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. If they don’t reach $9,000, Biebuyck said they will distribute one smaller set of books, which will be different for each library to cater to different demographics. The smaller sets are between 10 and 14 books per library, she said, and the average cost is $150 per set.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle Way has been lucky in the project, Biebuyck said, as they partnered with Boxcar Books, a local nonprofit, for the project. Boxcar will sell Middle Way the books\\r\\nfor 35 percent less than the list price. Biebuyck said this price is about the same Boxcar Books paid to obtain the books from publishers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women have tag teamed as they try to promote the program, and Biebuyck said she has treated it as a side project because of her numerous other duties at Middle Way.\\r\\n\\r\\nLauver was hired as an intern for the project, but her job as a barista at Soma Coffee House and Juice Bar keeps her busy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the work is done at home. Biebuyck spends her off-hours sending emails, writing press releases and maintaining the website.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work has so far paid dividends. The website has garnered $1,724 in just 21 days.\\r\\nOne donor wrote Biebuyck an email explaining her reason for donating. The donor, an IU alumna, said she did so in memory of her grandmother, a woman who might have had a better life if she’d been able to find help.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is exactly the kind of resource many people, especially women, in that area would benefit from,” she tapped on her keyboard to a woman she’d never met.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The person I want to mention in the dedication, my late grandmother, born and raised in that area, could have had a life filled with much less pain if she’d had a resource like Middle Way House or books in her local library about abuse available to her when she was young, and I know she would have supported an effort such as this to help others in similar circumstances.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Uri Horesh, IU adjunct lecturer, was arrested Wednesday for disorderly conduct, battery and resisting arrest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was trying to donate blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoresh arrived at the Red Cross Bloodmobile, with a copy of IU’s non-discrimination policy in his pocket, and was asked to complete a questionnaire.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne question asked if he had sex, even once, with another man since 1977.\\r\\n\\r\\nPer Food and Drug Administration guidelines and recommendations for the blood industry, everyone who answers yes to this question is banned from donating.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s important to know that it’s no longer just a gay disease,” Horesh said. “This policy is very much outdated, and asking this very outdated question is clearly some kind of caving in to some very old and homophobic prejudice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FDA found that men who have sex with other men were 60 times more likely to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo ensure blood is collected from a population at low risk for disease, men who have sex with other men are banned from donating blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoresh answered yes to the question and was not allowed to contribute to the blood drive. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he was denied from donation, Horesh showed Red Cross employees IU’s non-discrimination policy. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe employees said there was nothing they could do and referred him to their supervisor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, Horesh said, they called IU Police Department, accusing him of spitting at one of the employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IUPD blotter lists Horesh as being arrested for assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoresh said he assumed that, as University employees, IUPD would be sympathetic to his case.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause Red Cross was invited to IU’s campus, Horesh said he thought the Bloodmobile would be subject to University policy on sexual orientation.\\r\\nInstead, he was handcuffed and spent a night in jail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not the first time Horesh has protested for LGBT rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, he went on a seven-day hunger strike at the University of Texas to protest the lack of same-sex partner benefits. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Nowhere in our policy does it say everybody has the right to give blood regardless of their sexual orientation,” University spokesman Mark Land said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s Mr. Horesh’s view, those are his words. We’re not letting anybody come on campus and violate our campus policies. This was expected protocol. He didn’t agree with it, but it has nothing to do with discriminating against anybody.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHoresh’s arrest has led him to faculty review with the vice provost for faculty and academic affairs and the dean of faculty.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is currently on leave with pay but was given the option to resign.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I decided not to resign,” Horesh said. “I thought resigning would be some sort of admission of guilt.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the time being, Horesh has been removed from his post at IU. He expects a decision on the University’s part in a few days.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Our primary concern is for the students,” said Tom Gieryn, vice provost for faculty and academic affairs. “We need to make sure that the events surrounding his arrest are not a distraction from teaching and learning in his classes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHoresh said he plans to plea not guilty to the charges.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis court date is July 30, but he is scheduled for a pre-trial conference with the judge.',\n",

The Institute has been a source of research and information about issues in sex, gender and reproduction since 1947.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Institute is named for Dr. Alfred Kinsey. Kinsey gathered histories of sexual behavior in thousands of interviews, which culminated in his book “Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,” published in 1948.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was followed by his “Sexual Behavior in the Human Female” in 1953. The volume “surprised everyone when it became a bestseller,” according to the Kinsey website.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kinsey Institute offers a library, art collections, events, an active research program and the Kinsey Confidential Website. For example, Kinsey has 250 original prints by Wilhelm von Gloeden, who is known as the first photographer of the male nude.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpen Monday through Friday, 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m., the Gallery showcases selected pieces from the Institute’s collection of art, artifacts and photography.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelf-guided tours are available Monday through Friday, 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., and guided public tours are offered on certain Fridays.

       "  'body': 'IU does a lot to keep its students safe, but students must do their part as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe residence halls at IU have many safety features designated to help freshmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 12 a.m., the entrances to the residence halls are locked, and students can only enter the building with a key card.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people wish to enter the building during late hours but don’t have a key card with them. Students might want to be helpful, but they should not allow those late-comers in, Bill Shipton said, director of student residential programs and services and judicial officer for the campus judicial system. The key-card system is very high-tech. Swiping a key-card can determine when a student has entered the residence hall or room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This may seem Big Brother-ish,” Shipton said. “But it really helps to keep track of missing students.” \\r\\n\\r\\nCameras in and around the residence halls serve the same purpose, Shipton said.\\r\\n\\r\\nResident assistants and police officers go on rounds to ensure that students are being safe late at night and during the early mornings.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany students think rounds are meant to get them in trouble, but it is really to benefit them, Shipton said. Students, however, will get in trouble if they are found participating in illicit activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe campus is well lit around the residence halls and parking lot, Shipton said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf students are having a bad experience while walking around campus — during the day or at night — they can get the IU Police Department to come their way without even calling them.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmergency stations around campus contact the IUPD and flash a blue light when a student pushes the button, Shipton said.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents can also make use of the safety escort, a service meant to provide students with an alternative to walking alone at night. The service is free and can transport a student anywhere on campus and from campus to an off-campus location. Students simply must provide their 10-digit student ID number to the dispatcher and show their student ID when entering the vehicle. The number is 812-855-SAFE.\\r\\n\\r\\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU TAKE THAT RED PARTY CUP\\r\\n\\r\\nWe won’t talk you out of drinking on a Friday night. No one else will, either. College is about making decisions for yourself. We just want you to be safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are a few things you should know if you do choose to attend that first big kegger.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou probably think it would never happen to you, but drinking can be dangerous. According to 2007 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 23,199 alcohol induced deaths, and some have occurred on this campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who are new to drinking typically have low tolerances for alcohol, so don’t overdo it. When you drink too much and pass out, your gag reflexes (which prevent choking) and your breathing can be suppressed. People who have drank enough to pass out are at risk of choking to death on their own vomit or suffering from alcohol poisoning, which results in emergency room visits or sometimes, death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s important to know that if you see a friend who is showing signs or symptoms of alcohol poisoning, don’t hesitate to call 911. You won’t get in trouble for saving someone’s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk\\r\\nAnother issue that can come with college parties is sexual assault. As many as one in four college women experience unwanted sexual intercourse in the United States, and many of these incidents happen at or after parties. The danger comes from a difference in expectations between men and women, said Elizabeth Armstrong, an IU assistant sociology professor, in a 2006 press release. The majority of sexual assaults involve alcohol. Here are some tips to help you out.\\r\\n» Watch for people who pressure you to drink or seem overly enthusiastic about getting you drunk.\\r\\n» Be careful with mixed punches or “Jungle Juice.” Their contents and alcohol volume are often a mystery.\\r\\n» Don’t leave your drink unattended.\\r\\n» Never leave a friend alone when she or he has had too much to drink.\\r\\n» Make arrangements with friends to stick together and agree on when to intervene if things look like they’re getting out of hand.\\r\\n» Stay in a public place, like the dance floor or seating area, and stay out of private rooms.\\r\\n» Know where you are and how to get home. Always at least have cash for a cab and don’t rely on someone you don’t know to give you a ride.\\r\\n» Trust your instincts. If you think someone is a creep, that person is most likely a creep.\\r\\n\\r\\nDID YOU KNOW...\\r\\n...that the IU Health Center has a Sexual Assault Crisis Service (SACS)? This service offers crisis intervention, individual and group counseling and educational programming. It is available for any member of the IU community for free. The service has a 24-hour telephone line, which will put you in touch with a specially trained counselor who can answer your questions and further assist you. The phone number is 812-855-8900. If you are in immediate danger, don’t hesitate to call 911.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Students no longer have to wait — Little 500 week has finally arrived on campus. The week is well known for its races, numerous activities and concerts. However, there is another aspect of Little 500 that many students look forward to: the partying.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Last year, I went to Lil Wayne’s concert, a few frat parties and a few house parties,” junior Shan Shaikh said. “It was pretty tight. It was an all-out rager for a week. There was drinking, dancing, girls and all sorts of fun stuff.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with the partying comes side effects, including blackouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nJackie Daniels, a social worker at the Office of Alternative Screening and Intervention Services in the IU Division of Student Affairs, defined a “blackout” as the loss of memory someone experiences during an episode of drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A person’s susceptibility to blacking out is increased if they drink too much too quickly or engage in ‘binge drinking,’” Daniels said. “This is defined as five or more drinks for a male in less than two hours and four for women.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Finn, a professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and principal investigator in the Biobehavioral Alcohol Research Laboratory, described blackouts as “a block of time that you cannot recall during the period that you were drinking.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alcohol affects the neurons in the hippocampus, which plays an important role in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory,” Finn said. “In an easy-to-understand fashion, alcohol disrupts the hippocampus memory-encoding function to where it isn’t recording anymore. A person who experiences a blackout will never be able to remember what occurred during that time frame. When the hippocampus isn’t functioning, it isn’t recording.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels described why a person experiencing a blackout is still able to function.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Basically, other functions controlled with the brain are not shut down completely,” Daniels said. “Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, causing the slowing of or depression of key bodily functions necessary to keep you alive — breathing, heart rate and consciousness.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople generally black out when they reach 0.20 blood alcohol content levels, Daniels said. Once a BAC level of 0.30 is reached, a person can pass out, and once a 0.40 BAC level is reached, a person can enter a coma.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a person’s body tries to protect itself in many ways before reaching that level of intoxication.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Vomiting or running back and forth to the bathroom is an attempt to expel the poison you are feeding your body,” Daniels said. “Your body sends you signals at each BAC check point, and if you pay attention to these signals, you will know when to stop. However, this signaling system malfunctions if you drink more than one to two drinks per hour.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two types of blackouts: en bloc and fragmentary.\\r\\n\\r\\n“En bloc is when you cannot remember anything from a specific period of time,” Daniels said. “Fragmentary is more commonly called a brownout, when you can only remember snippets of an event or conversation. Fragmentary are more commonly experienced, but both are equally dangerous.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter experiencing a blackout, Daniels said, most students she speaks to feel anxious and regretful.\\r\\n\\r\\nDirector of IU Counseling and Psychological Services Nancy Stockton shares a similar attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Students come in and talk about experiencing blackouts,” Stockton said. “They say that their friends tell them things that they can’t remember, and by and large, it’s usually disturbing to students. It’s kind of a wake-up call and maybe one of the things that brings them in to CAPS.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThough drinking alcohol in excess is a major contributor to blackouts, there are other factors that come into play that might tip the scale toward actually experiencing a blackout, Finn said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How alcohol affects a person has to do with that individual,” Finn said. “Some people are more sensitive to the effects of alcohol, others less so. It has to do with tolerance.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOftentimes, the rate at which individuals consume their alcohol is the deciding factor of whether the person actually experiences a blackout, Finn said. When alcohol is consumed quickly, a person’s BAC quickly increases, as opposed to slow consumption, which allows the body to adapt to the presence of the alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When a person goes from a BAC level of zero to 0.15, which is about six drinks for your average 140-pound person, in a short amount of time, they more or less shock the system,” Finn said. “That can trigger a blackout. If alcohol is consumed slowly, certain adaptive processes are engaged that are able to handle that amount of alcohol. Of course, once a person reaches a certain level, even if they have been drinking slowly, they can experience a blackout.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFatigue, hunger and stress are other factors that affect how fast the alcohol content in a person’s blood rises, Finn said, which in turn affects whether a person experiences a blackout.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinn said the number of students who experience a blackout at IU is undoubtedly high.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do a lot of studies regarding people who have alcohol problems, including students at IU,” Finn said. “We have diagnostic interviews where we ask questions, like, ‘how often do you experience blackouts?’ As to how many actually experience blackouts, my general impression is that it is quite prevalent, at least in those who report heavy drinking. Higher than one might think.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLast week, the IU Student Association established a Culture of Care week to\\r\\naddress the safety and social issues that are happening on campus and in the Bloomington community.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer Chief of Staff Megan Lillie worked with other IUSA members to make students more aware of the dangers of alcohol abuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The purpose of this week is to change the current culture and emphasize the need for all community members to step up and be Hoosiers,” Lillie said. “This means intervening in situations where students need help, specifically in situations related to sexual assault, mental health and drug and alcohol abuse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday as a part of Culture of Care week, IUSA focused on alcohol and drug usage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thursday, we focused on the dangers of binge drinking and recognizing when it has taken a turn for the worst,” Lillie said. “Blacking out is the body’s last attempt at preserving life, and oftentimes this phrase is used in a humorous context to describe a night’s activities. The current culture at IU embraces this phrase, and it has led to many tragedies on campus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, researchers from the Department of Psychiatry at Duke University in North Carolina wrote an article titled “Prevalence and Correlates of Alcohol-Induced Blackouts Among College Students: Results of an E-Mail Survey,” which was featured in the Journal of American College Health.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter surveying 772 college students via email, the authors found that “approximately 51 percent of those who had ever consumed alcohol reported that they had experienced a blackout at some point in their lives.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOther results of the survey showed that 40 percent of those surveyed had experienced a blackout the year before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong those who drank in the two weeks before the survey, nearly one in 10 reported having experienced a blackout, according to the article.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter working with students who have talked about experiencing blackouts, Stockton said students often regret having blacked out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People in general don’t like feeling out of control,” Stockton said. “They are made very uncomfortable by the fact that they may have behaved in ways they don’t remember.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDaniels said she understands that alcohol is inevitably going to be a part of campus life and that she wants students to be safe.?\\r\\n\\r\\n“My general impression is that students would not black out if they knew how not to do so,” Daniels said. “I’m invested in making sure students know as much as possible to make sure they are drinking safely, not just legally, but so they survive without harm.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Little 500 week already in full swing, students are attending concerts, events and other activities that are all part of the experience. To have a successful week, Shaikh said students just have to watch themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can have a good time without overdoing it,” Shaikh said. “I’ve seen people whose weeks have had to end early, and that’s just not cool. All you have to do is watch yourself, and you will have an awesome Little Five week.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Little 500 is a week for drunken revelry and carefree celebration. We celebrate the end of spring semester, we celebrate one of IU’s oldest and greatest traditions and we celebrate each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s exactly a time like Lil 5, when we tend to be careless with our drinking and our decision-making, that we need a reminder to be careful. We especially need to be careful with each other’s bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nHooking up is a general side effect, maybe even a desired side effect, of Little 500 week’s drinking and partying. We know at least some of our friends are excited to get it in this weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, with great partying comes great responsibility. Our culture is a culture of rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore you denounce the feminist overtones of such a statement, consider the consequences of totally denying the existence of rape culture. You risk endangering yourself, your friends and your sexual partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe popular SlutWalk movement has arisen out of a need to combat victim blaming, in which women who dress “provocatively” are assumed to be asking for it. Women often know and continue relationships with their sexual assailant.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of 42 reported sex offenses in the past three years that data was available at IU (2008, 2009 and 2010), 41 were “forcible” and only one was “non-forcible.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis might reflect a broad belief that violence is the only qualifier for rape, which, by definition, is any non-consensual sexual activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn’t an accusation of generalized maliciousness on the part of men or women who sexually assault their partners. An American Pscyhological Association survey of campus rape culture found most rapes seemed to be due to miscommunication between genders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis miscommunication results from assumptions about sexuality and refusal to practice proper methods of valid consent. What is “consent”?\\r\\n\\r\\nConsent is an enthusiastic affirmation between two (or more) people that both people want to engage in physical/sexual activity. Consent is not the absence of “no” (whether this “no” is verbal or physical).\\r\\n\\r\\nConsent is not being so drunk that one person or both people are unable to really assess whether they want anything physical or sexual, so things “just happen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing drunk is no excuse not to get consent. If anything, it is a reason to be more careful. If you have sex without consent, it is, by definition, rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever you want to engage in sexual activities with someone, you ask the person what is OK, and you proceed or don’t proceed based on the answer. So, what else can you do to fight rape culture?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should intervene when you see a potentially harmful situation. According to a 2011 survey, 77 percent of IU students think that if someone had stepped up and intervened when they witnessed inappropriate sexual behavior (including, but not limited to, sexual assault and rape), a negative outcome or situation could have been avoided.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you see friends bringing a drunk people into their rooms, stop them. Ask what the situation is, make them keep the door open and continuously check on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDo whatever you need to do to ensure that everything is OK. It’s better to be awkward in a situation than to risk the occurrence of rape or sexual assault. If you hear a potentially violent exchange happening in your hallway, knock on the door to make sure everything’s OK, which will momentarily stop the fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle 500 has been called the world’s greatest college weekend. We can’t wait to celebrate in style with new and old friends. Especially when so many of us will be drinking, remember it’s everyone’s responsibility to fight rape and sexual assault.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Sexual assault protesters chanted as they walked down the street. A sea of fishnet stockings, corsets, heels and little black dresses marched through Bloomington, parting the way for women’s rights and freedom of expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nPosters soared above the walkers demanding sexual awareness and the freedom of dress. Encouraged to wear whatever outfit they deemed fit, women charged the street, embracing their sexuality, knowing that if they were raped, abused or assaulted, it was not their fault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I came to the SlutWalk to help raise awareness about sexual assault,” freshman Emily Gall said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolding a handmade poster that read, “No Means No,” Gall joined the crowd of about 150, mostly women, drawn to the event to speak on behalf of abused and assaulted women everywhere.     \\r\\n\\r\\nAnonymous “slut statements” were read aloud while members of Ladies First, IU’s only all-female a capella group, prepared their live performance for the gathering.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I walk for all the girls who were to afraid to speak up,” one protester echoed from the microphone, followed by screams and applause. The event was about to begin, and SlutWalk participants were pumped for the walk to Kirkwood Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe walk began at 6:30 p.m. Thursday in Dunn Meadow. It was sponsored and organized by IU’s Women’s Student Association and Safe Sisters, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it was Bloomington’s first SlutWalk, head coordinator Emily Kitchen said she just hoped for a good turnout.     \\r\\n\\r\\n“I was surprised we did not already have a SlutWalk before I decided to bring it to Bloomington,” Kitchen said. “Since it is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, I thought it was a good time to educate about the problems of rape and slut blaming.”     \\r\\n\\r\\nThough new to Bloomington, SlutWalks have been organized in locations around the world. It was created after a Toronto police officer said in an 2011 lecture, “Women should avoid dressing like sluts in order to not be victimized.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think his (statement) is really representative of what our culture thinks,” Grace Evans, member of the Women’s Student Association, said. “I think our society missed an important message of not blaming the victim.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe also said the SlutWalk event was not to redefine “slut” but instead to support awareness and women’s self-expression.      \\r\\n\\r\\nThe mission of SlutWalk is to speak to both men and women, advocating the importance of unity, freedom of expression and diminishing the stereotypes and myths of sexual abuse, according to a press release.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlutWalk helps to promote a safe environment and community, and it also supports wearing whatever clothing is the most comfortable and not having clothes speak for themselves, according to the press release.     \\r\\n\\r\\nDirector of the Women’s Student Association Rachael Richter said she is really tired of people saying “she was asking for it.”    \\r\\n\\r\\n“A tight shirt does not mean ‘wants to get laid’,” Richter said. “Self-expression, personal style, safe environment is what we’re doing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKitchen said she hopes the SlutWalk event continues in future years.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are here to put our foot down,” she said. “There are no excuses to be\\r\\nvictimized.”',\n",

We demand all bodies to be respected. No matter if you are a woman, man, trans, white, black, gay, straight, younger, older, have a low or high income — no one should feel worried that they might be victimized because of the way they dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlutWalk is coming to Bloomington with more than 365 people attending on the Facebook event, more than 60 likes on the Facebook group and six organizations helping to organize this event.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems people support and understand that SlutWalk brings an important message. The power of SlutWalk comes from people who are tired of being told that a mini-skirt, tight shirt, high heels or jeans is an invitation or means that they are “asking for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe acknowledge women of color have a relationship to the word “slut” that might make it difficult or impossible to reclaim that word. For this reason we have chosen not to emphasize reclamation as a process for our event.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I hope comes from this is an event that helps create a conversation within this diverse Bloomington community around consent, victim-blaming and worth as human beings that is not determined by our sexuality. This is an event that fights to end the stigma of sexual assault, an event that educates people. I only see the event doing more good than harm.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one person becomes aware of victim-blaming or stops thinking that people should suffer the consequences because of how someone dresses, then it has served its purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you believe that all are welcome — no matter what they wear — and should not be blamed for sexual assault or rape, then come to SlutWalk Bloomington at 6:30 p.m. Thursday in Dunn Meadow for a march down Kirkwood Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— Emily Kitchen,\\r\\nCoordinator of SlutWalk Bloomington\\r\\nemkitche@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'I would like to start this editorial response by being clear that, on the whole, I sympathize with Francisco Tirado’s “I’m a survivor, alright?” column published Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was a freshman in high school, this pasty redhead painted his fingernails black and wore black band shirts and tight, black pants. I was not popular, even though I so desperately wanted to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd one day in gym class, I was reminded just how different I was when I got pantsed in front of my entire class — cropped gym shorts, tighty-whities and all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only response my P.E. teacher could muster as I pulled up my pride was to say to the kid, “What, are you a homosexual or something?  You wanna see his penis?” I stood in awe, saying nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis man in a place of authority, my teacher, had missed the point. Or worse maybe — he had gotten the point all too well.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeenage suicides occur at a significantly higher rate among LGBT youth than heterosexuals. Bullying is undoubtedly common.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the dominant solution — Dan Savage’s “It Gets Better” campaign, which has come to define our generation — only creates a culture of passive victimhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are told to stand there and stare as they figure out that we’re as normal as they are.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as we believe the myth that society has come around to integrating African-Americans and women, so too do they exhort us to believe it will with homosexuals. Pull your pants up, the videos tell me, and wait for the right, tolerant response to come around. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the very rhetoric Tuesday’s column supports. Much of the queer community can certainly sympathize with the narrative, as I myself do, in which an unpopular kid becomes the victim of ridicule.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that is not the only narrative. We are constantly told, even by infantile adults such as Doug Wilson, that we are “afraid of success,” poorly coded language that means we are afraid to take part in a society that mandates coupling based on heterosexual standards. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut those failures to succeed cannot define us in simple terms. Queer youth are not only bullied in their high school but are also denied in a myriad of ways the fundamental right to live.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have, in fact, always lived outside the institution of marriage, and consequently, our primary problems as a community are not marriage or fitting in or even being cool.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueer youth are constantly faced with familial abuse, homelessness (one in four will become homeless the day they come out), and, as Tuesday’s column rightly pointed out, legal sanctioning of public verbal assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo promote the idea of being a survivor, while personally true and resonant for some, cannot capture the total rejection youth experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nI take issue with this word “survivor” in that it paints a gay man as a victim. We have to shed our idea of being victims and instead become agents and advocates. \\r\\n\\r\\nWaiting for the right, tolerant response will only disappoint us. We should therefore not let Mr. Wilson’s words “speak for themselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should be using Mr. Wilson’s visit to IU as an opportunity to open dialogue.  Approaching sexuality in the same way we have been since “It Gets Better” cannot produce constructive conversation about bigotry.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must not assert our success in life but assert our failure to Doug Wilson’s expectations, cast off the badge of survivor victimhood and refuse to conform to a standard of heterosexual progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must show how we never have, and never want to, fit in, because fitting in means that we continue to tacitly allow ignorance about queer exclusion and abuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we focus on fitting in, we forget those who cannot fit in. How does the black lesbian fit in? The boy who sees himself a girl? The man who will never marry?\\r\\n\\r\\nThey cannot be subsumed under survivorhood if we only understand success in the terms of heterosexual standards.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s go out to Doug Wilson’s talk on Friday. Let’s sit with grinding teeth through all his ignorant chirpings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let’s remind him that we are not willing to conform to his standard of success. We would rather be the outcasts than create more of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s pull down our own pants, so to speak, and refuse to lift them back up.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— jbhayden@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Waving around a plastic bottle of water, feminist author Jaclyn Friedman spoke about the commodity model — a heteronormative transaction in which women are expected to protect their sexuality while men are encouraged to pursue it — Tuesday evening in Woodburn Hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The bottle is my lady sex — an unopened, untouched object, not my body,” she said.   \\r\\n\\r\\nFriedman is the coeditor of “Yes Means Yes” and the author of “What Women Really Really Want: The Smart Girl’s Shame-Free Guide to Sex and Safety.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA popular speaker traveling to numerous campuses around the country, Friedman has been featured in Jezebel, CNN and the Washington Post speaking on behalf of women’s rights, sexual awareness and feminist issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriedman was sexually assaulted in college, believing she was too smart to be sexually assaulted until it happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sex should be a conversation,” Friedman said. “It is hard to talk openly because we live in such a commodity world where men know everything about women and what we want.”   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs a beginning event of the IU Student Association’s Culture of Care Week, the auditorium, plastered with fliers, posters and ribbons, was packed with young women. \\r\\n\\r\\nSophomore Jayne Fortner said she found the talk interesting in light of the current debate surrounding the fate of the Office of Women’s Affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriedman addressed issues of sexual activities including consent, the effects of alcohol and how to engage in relationships in a smart, healthy way.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who would like to have sex with people who are actively into it?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer concept of enthusiastic consent grants girls permission to engage in safe sex without getting locked into it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not a light switch,” Friedman said. “It is not once you say ‘yes,’ then you can’t back out. Instead, sex should be like synchronized swimming.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFriedman compared the water to consent, with a person always being surrounded by it and not being able to continue if his or her partner is not with him or her the whole time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFriedman also spoke about the importance of being able to talk about sex with your partner. Her list of rules include using your strengths, being confident and practicing discussing sex beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy not being able to talk about sex, you are sending yourself a dangerous message that your feelings and beliefs do not matter, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Her lecture was inspiring because she uses dialogue we don’t normally have on subjects we don’t normally talk about,” said Colleen Leahy, member of the IU Division of Student Affairs and IDS opinion columnist.\\r\\n\\r\\nMixing humor, sarcasm and some swear words, Friedman advocated her views and advice about serious subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am pro-sex. I want everyone to have great, safe sex or no sex, if they choose,” she said. “I want people to know all of their opinions, because honestly, sex is wicked cool.”\\r\\n\\r\\n   \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",

       "  'body': 'As Indiana University considers closing, consolidating or restructuring the Office for Women’s Affairs, which for 40 years has strived to empower women in academia and combat gender inequities on campus, we should turn our attention to the possibility of reforming OWA to better deal with gender issues on campus today.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no question that an office such as OWA is needed at this University. Many of OWA’s initiatives are beneficial to everyone, such as the IU Working Moms program, which works to provide a more family-friendly and convenient work environment on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nOWA provides networking tools and advice for new female faculty members, combats sexual assault through student-led workshops and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should take this opportunity to reassess OWA and find potential places for improvement. Perhaps the most significant area in which OWA might reevaluate its approach is in some of the workshops for its Savant program, a peer-educator group that has seminars on issues such as bystander intervention, intimate partner violence and sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nGroups such as this are vital to combating rape and sexual assault by teaching students how to intervene in situations of sexual violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe approach of such groups is often built on the male-on-female violence paradigm, and Savant does a great job of busting these stereotyped roles (male as predator and female as prey, in exclusively heterosexual relationships) in its presentations by talking about sexual assault in a non-gendered way.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, OWA’s Savant workshops “Beyond Excuses: The 411 On Treating All Women With Respect and Dignity (for men only)” and “Talking Back to Sexual Pressure (for women only)” provide an example of programs that could be changed to better deal with gender issues on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue isn’t that men haven’t been told to respect women. To be perceived as sexually desirable, men cannot treat women respectfully — they must be heartless players or studs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue isn’t only that women don’t know how to say “no,” it’s also that women who emphatically say “yes” to sex are considered sluts or whores. Women and men alike are in a double bind when it comes to sex, and having workshops that are based on these stereotypical roles is not conducive to dismantling rape culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nA suggestion for reform would be to merge these two workshops and make them open and applicable to all genders (e.g. “Treating All People With Respect and Dignity and Understanding Consent”).\\r\\n\\r\\nOWA might also consider eliminating its Savant workshop “Exploring the Empowering Sensuality of Celibacy,” which seems to promote abstinence “as a refreshing alternative to the campus sex scene.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA program such as this has no place in an office fighting sexual assault and rape, as it implies abstinence is a viable way to combat sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nRather than promoting a certain view of sexuality, OWA should be more concerned with ensuring that all sexual experiences are consensual, safe and healthy. OWA should remain an integral part of IU and evolve its approach and programs to deal with the issues of an increasingly complex world of gender and sexuality.',\n",

Many victims do not realize they need help until months or years have passed.\\r\\n— Know that the most common response in a sexual assault situation is to freeze.\\r\\n— Look for common reactions to sexual assault.\\r\\n    Emotional: shock, disbelief, intense sadness, anger, guilt, shame.\\r\\n    Mental: fears about personal safety, remembering what happened and what it felt like, flashbacks, difficulty concentrating on routine activities.\\r\\n    Behavioral: changes in sexual behavior, self-destructive behavior, extreme reactions to stress.\\r\\n    Physical: sleep disturbance, headaches, stomach aches, depression, changes in eating habits.\\r\\n— Know the definitions of sexual assault and rape. Middle Way House defines rape as sexual intercourse that is forced or coerced, including intimidation or physical force. Sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal or oral penetration of any kind. The organization defines sexual assault as completed or attempted unwanted sexual contact. Sexual assault includes such things as grabbing, fondling and verbal threats.\\r\\n— Notify the police if you are comfortable. Reporting the crime can help you regain a sense of control and may help to ensure the safety of other potential victims. Notifying the police does not mean you have to press charges against your assailant.\\r\\n— Press charges if you believe that is the right decision. If you decide to press charges...\\r\\n    Preserve all evidence of the assault. Do not shower, bathe, douche, wash your clothes or brush your teeth. Do not disturb anything in the area where the assault occurred.\\r\\n    Write down as much as you can remember about the circumstances of the assault, including a description of the assailant.\\r\\n    Go to the hospital emergency department and ask for a rape kit examination within 96 hours of the assault to preserve evidence needed for a prosecution. Asking for this exam does not mean you will have to press charges. Exams are free in Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you decide to receive a rape kit examination...\\r\\n— Know how the process works. Middle Way House Prevention Programs Coordinator Cierra Thomas-Williams described the rape kit examination that a victim will encounter.\\r\\n    - The person administering the rape kit will bring out a 8x11 box with cultures in it.\\r\\n    - The victim will stand on a tarp as the exam is administered.\\r\\n    - The person administering will take pictures and check every place on the body, using cotton swabs.\\r\\n    - The person administering has to stay with the rape kit the entire time. The rape kit is then sealed and refrigerated.\\r\\n— Getting a rape kit does not mean you have to report the rape right away. You have up to two years to report a rape and you have the option to not report at all.\\r\\n— Know where to get a rape kit exam.\\r\\n    IU-Health Bloomington Hospital 812-336-9515\\r\\n    IU Health Center 812-855-4011\\r\\n    Morgan Hospital (Martinsville) 765-349-6522\\r\\n    Greene County General Hospital (Linton) 812-847-5204\\r\\n    Dunn Memorial (Bedford) 812-275-3331\\r\\n    Daviess Community Hospital (Washington) 812-254-8892\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your friend has been sexually assaulted...\\r\\n— Believe the survivor about what happened. Assure the survivor that it was not his/her fault.\\r\\n— Listen attentively and without judgment to allow the survivor to work through the pain.\\r\\n— Be patient. The healing process is not linear. It may be months or years before a survivor is able to handle the feelings associated with the assault in a way that lets her/him move forward.\\r\\n— Permitting and encouraging the survivor to make her/his own decisions is an essential part of recovery. Respect the survivor’s confidentiality and decisions about how, when and with whom she/he shares the details of the assault.\\r\\n— As a caregiver, you may have some psychological experiences that are similar to those the survivor faces.

       "  'body': \"AUTHOR’S NOTE: Sexual assault issues are highlighted every April for Sexual Assault Awareness Month. But for the people who experience sexual assault firsthand, the memories last for years.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, senior Caroline Shurig and Middle Way House Prevention Programs Coordinator Cierra Thomas-Williams bravely share the personal stories of their own experiences with sexual assault as well as their fight to make a difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nFind audio of the two women's stories and additional information at www.idsnews.com/sexualassault.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s been six years for senior Caroline Shurig, 12 years for Cierra Thomas-Williams, but they still wake to nightmares.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At first, it was every other day,” Caroline says in November. “The last one was probably three weeks ago. It was the most graphic I’ve had in years.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s been a long time, but not enough for her and Cierra to forget they were sexually assaulted. They’ve dealt with the nightmares, with their memories, but Caroline and Cierra can’t forget that not long ago, their control was taken from them and that they’ve fought to get it back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even though it’s been over 10 years since any of that stuff has happened, I still feel like it was yesterday,” Cierra says. “And so I’m not in a place of healing quite yet, but I’m trying to get there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA place of healing doesn’t come easily — something Caroline and Cierra have both learned while volunteering at Middle Way House. At the Bloomington nonprofit, they help other sexual assault survivors — those who have defeated the victim-mentality — through the healing process. Along the way, the two women have become survivors themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA Gift\\r\\nTunnel vision hits once Caroline hits the hallway at IU-Health Bloomington Hospital. The beeping, the talking and the noise all drown out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adrenaline she felt in the seven minutes from her house to the hospital becomes a sudden calm. Her heart slows. She’s in the zone. She’ll get information from the triage nurse, first. Is it domestic violence? Sexual assault? Rape? She has a minute and a half to learn as much as she can. Then she’s in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an on-scene advocate for Middle Way House, Caroline sees survivors in the first hours after they’ve been sexually assaulted. She signs up for on-call shifts, sometimes up to six a week, and drives to the hospital at the survivor’s request.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the hospital, she listens patiently to the survivors or sits in silence. She provides encouragement or keeps a distance. She’s there for support when the survivors need her most because six years ago, she was in their shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix years ago, Caroline was late to class. She was 16 years old, a sophomore in high school. As she ran up a back staircase, with thoughts of figure skating practice and landing that jump clouding her mind, she didn’t notice the senior standing in front of her.\\r\\n“The first time it happened, it was more like him shoving me up against the wall and forcefully assaulting me,” she says. “But it was definitely all over the clothes. I pushed him away and walked up the stairs and the day just went on.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assaults didn’t stop there. During the next three months, Caroline says, she was assaulted by the same attacker multiple times. He stalked her, appearing at the movies, by her car, in the mall — everywhere. The last time, he attacked her near the woods next to her school’s parking lot. She blacked out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a piece of sidewalk that I was walking on one day, and I know exactly where my foot stepped and where I saw him again,” she says. “Then I have no memory between that time and a large, several week period of time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCaroline explains that blacking out was a defense mechanism, something her brain did to protect her from remembering the trauma. She understands that now after working at Middle Way House and seeing other survivors relive the experience again and again. She doesn’t want that. She’s glad her brain blocked it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a way, it’s Caroline’s choice. She chooses not to try to remember what happened in attempts to put the assaults behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\nRestoring a survivor’s choice in everyday situations is most important in Caroline’s job, as well as in her own life. She says regaining choice has to start right after the assault when survivors have lost all sense of safety and control.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sometimes they’ll obsess on an article of clothing,” Caroline says as an example. “‘Those are my favorite mittens I have right here. I take them everywhere with me. My grandmother knitted them for me. They’re special to me.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s the survivor’s choice to keep the mittens, and Caroline makes sure that happens, even if it means giving up a piece of evidence. The mittens could contain DNA, or they could give a clue to the attacker’s identity. But Caroline doesn’t care.  The survivor is her priority, and it’s the survivor’s choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My job is to say she wants the gloves,” Caroline says. “We’ve got to respect her choice. I don’t care about evidence collection. I just care about her.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCaroline knows what it’s like to not let go of a piece of clothing. She still keeps the Keds she was wearing the first time she was attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I still wear them, and I kind of sometimes feel triumphant when I wear them,” she says. “Like, an ‘I’m above you’ kind of thing. That’s just important to me to never get rid of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCaroline still catches herself acting overly controlling the way she tells survivors not to — getting defensive when she hears someone rephrase her story or needing to be close to a doorway at all times — but because of her work, she says she can explain those behaviors and make an active decision not to do them. She knows she craves control as a way of coping.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaroline controls who she tells her story to and how she tells them. She says if she tells people, she could lose control of what they think of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would say that when I explain it to them, and I’m always in a very controlled environment, I’m very clear about this doesn’t define me,” she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt took years for Caroline to get to that point. At first, it did define her.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, understanding her own tendencies has helped Caroline become a survivor, not a victim. She says she can relate more easily to survivors and can understand that their manners after being sexually assaulted aren’t erratic —  they’re normal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s just that gut feeling that, ‘Oh, that would bother me,’” Caroline says. “That’s a gift it’s given me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding Healthy Relationships\\r\\nCierra teaches high-school and middle-school students how to define rape and sexual assault. Through her program, Building Healthy Relationships, she teaches them what to do if they’ve experienced it themselves, and she knows some of them already have.\\r\\n\\r\\nCierra sees the ways they react to her program. She hears their stories after class. She can’t separate the students’ feelings from her own experiences, even after more than 10 years. She can’t.\\r\\nNot yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a freshman in high school, Cierra was raped the first time she had sex. Her boyfriend was a senior. It was his 18th birthday. He ignored Cierra’s constant reminder that she wouldn’t have sex with him, and when he began taking off her pants,\\r\\nshe froze.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People don’t talk about what fear does to you. It freezes a lot of people,” she says. “Rape happens so easily when the body shuts down. It took me becoming an educator about that to feel it inside that it’s not my fault.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCierra needed someone like her in high school. She needed an adult to talk to and help her figure out what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter her boyfriend raped her, Cierra’s health teacher taught her class about rape and sexual assault. She told her students to talk to her in person or write a letter if they needed to talk. Cierra took the opportunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn’t an easy letter to write, and while it was only one sentence, it took Cierra a long time to put into words.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My boyfriend had sex with me when I didn’t want to, was I raped?”\\r\\nThe next day, Cierra was invisible. Her teacher ignored her. Her question went\\r\\nunanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To me, that said, ‘It’s okay that your boyfriend raped you,’” Cierra says. “I carried that with me for a long time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCierra began volunteering with Building Healthy Relationships in 2008 and became the program’s director in May 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program consists of interactive lessons that teach students ages 11 to 19 the difference between abuse and equality. Day one starts with gender stereotyping. Day two moves to healthy and unhealthy relationships. Day three discusses rape. It’s the day Cierra says the most students are absent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose parents feel like that’s something too heavy for a 10th grader to be learning about,” Cierra says.\\r\\n\\r\\nCierra can see the students are already dealing with the issues, even as teenagers. She says they need this curriculum so they can stop the stereotyping, the abuse and the pain before they start.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter showing a video about rape, Cierra says one male student who had not talked once the previous two days spoke up after a survivor’s friend called her attacker a rapist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t call him that,” the student said. “That’s like calling someone a burglar for stealing a dollar.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCierra waited as the student’s classmates responded. She knew the women in the room would correct him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re comparing a woman who’s been victimized to a dollar bill?” a female student said. “Her sexuality and choice is worth a dollar?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Burglars steal millions and millions of dollars, and that’s what makes them a burglar,” the male student replied. “If you were standing on the edge of a cliff, and you throw yourself off a cliff, would you blame the cliff for falling off?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation came up again a few periods later, Cierra says, and this time, the class came up with a conclusion: You have to rape more than once to be considered\\r\\na rapist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I said no,” Cierra says. “We just defined rape as un-consensual sex. There’s no number on there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Cierra can handle students’ thoughts and reactions in the classroom, speaking with them one-on-one about their experiences can be difficult. She can’t separate her memories from theirs. She hasn’t yet found a balance between her assaults and her work.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I need to not feel their pain as intensely as I do,” she says. “It immobilizes me.”\\r\\nLike Caroline, Cierra keeps a piece of clothing from when she was assaulted again in college — when her boyfriend’s friend and three roommates raped her after a night at the bars. It’s a simple sundress, one that used to make her feel good about herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the rape, she transformed the dress into a piece of artwork. She mounted the dress on a piece of paper and printed her story in bold on it. She then placed barbed wire around the dress and hung it in a survivor’s art gallery at her college.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It ended up being a very dangerous piece of clothing for me,” she says. “It ruined me in many, many ways. I lost my confidence and self-esteem again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCierra still has the dress somewhere in her house. One day, she’ll burn it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It makes me really sad, the young woman who I was, and I’m still trying to overcome that guilt and shame,” she says, “so I need to burn it and get rid of it when I’m good and ready.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat guilt makes Cierra blame herself for the rapes. She knows, morally, that it’s wrong to blame herself and not her attackers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I struggle to not do that to myself,” she says. “Those guys knew what they were doing to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCierra understands her job’s importance. If she weren’t there, who would be? It’s not every day an adult tells students she wants to listen to their problems. It’s not every day the adult understands them. Even if Cierra can’t separate her memories from her work, she knows she’s reaching students through her program.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s so necessary that it’s not something that would ever cause me to quit,” Cierra says. “I guess it keeps me\\r\\nmotivated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGetting Through\\r\\nIt’s been a long road for Caroline and Cierra — one they share. When they tell their stories of rape and sexual assault, there are patterns, overlaps and similarities. They’ve both reached a point where they can share their stories, where they want to help people understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaroline won’t be an on-scene advocate much longer. She graduates in May, and that’s when she’ll stop. In the fall, she plans to study adoption law. It’s still advocating but a different topic, she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle Way House has been a good experience, she says, but her time there\\r\\nis finished.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s just been a part of getting through everything and the process,” she says. “It’ll hold a role in my life, but I don’t think I ever want to work at a full-time job dealing with it specifically. I admire (advocates’) courage, but I don’t think I have the strength to keep it out of my personal life.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCierra will remain at Middle Way House as long as her job, which is grant funded, exists. She loves educating and has endless passion for it, she says.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve had quite a few jobs, and this job makes me feel like I’m actually doing something,” she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s been two years for Caroline, four years for Cierra since they joined Middle Way House in fighting back. They can’t forget their own experiences, and they don’t want to.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It changed my outlook on how I look at things. I’m a more compassionate person,” Caroline says. “People are surprised when I say I wouldn’t take it back. It took a long time for me to say I’m glad it happened. It hasn’t defined me.”\",\n",

       "  'body': 'We hope everyone is familiar with the shooting of Trayvon Martin by now. The 17-year-old black student was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, a Hispanic man who claims he was acting in self-defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe merits of Zimmerman’s claim are hardly worth debating, seeing as he is a grown man who was wielding a semiautomatic weapon while Martin was a high-school student carrying candy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe murder has sparked nationwide outrage at both Zimmerman and the police department that has refused to prosecute him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a tragedy, and the aftermath has only made it worse, as some have complicated the matter in an effort to exonerate Zimmerman through slandering Martin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt recently came to light that Martin had been suspended from his school 10 days before his murder. He was suspended after school officials found a baggie containing traces of marijuana in his book bag.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been tied to the narrative put forward by some bloggers and conservative media that Martin was a bad apple and a criminal in the making.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, those denigrating Martin’s character ignore the fact that black students are three and a half times as likely to be suspended than white students, a prejudice in modern school systems, according to a New York Times article.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even if we set aside the issue of racism in school discipline, Martin’s suspension record is still irrelevant to his murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s be honest for a moment. How many IU students have weed in their book bags at this very moment? You couldn’t throw a brick on this campus without hitting a stoner, but no one would ever suggest that we begin executing IU students for being thugs and criminals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crucial difference between most IU students and Martin is, of course, race.\\r\\nInternet and media commentators are gleefully tearing through Martin’s past, including pictures and tweets illegally obtained by a white supremacist hacker.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey point to his suspensions, images in which Martin wears a grill and tweets with foul language, and they exclaim that he was a thug. The implication is that anyone who meets the slippery definition of thug deserves whatever fate a man with a gun decides for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very fact that the Martin family feels moved to publicize private photos of Trayvon with small children or riding a horse is a defense that should not be required of a family in grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a classic example of victim-blaming. Just as when a woman is sexually assaulted, those who would defend privilege are crawling out of the woodwork to tear down the reputation of the victim, rather than that of the true criminal.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrayvon Martin was murdered in cold blood. Nothing else matters.',\n",

       "  'body': 'While the Office for Women’s Affairs celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, it is also taking stock of its accomplishments and fighting to stay open.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Dean Yvette Alex-Assensoh’s decision to take a position at the University of Oregon, Interim Provost Lauren Robel recently sent an email to faculty and staff saying the University would be convening an advisory board to determine the future of offices for women on campus. In short, OWA might be closing its doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt OWA’s last faculty advisory board meeting, Alex-Assensoh led the board in a discussion about the office’s successes and its future.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlex-Assensoh faced the women, ready to address their questions. “We’ll continue to do work until our doors are closed,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone asked what would happen to OWA’s summer orientation programs for incoming freshmen. Another asked why the University is even considering closing the office in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, there aren’t many answers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What I am concerned about most is preserving the mission of the office and my team members,” Alex-Assensoh said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the OWA was founded in 1972, the same year as the passage of Title IX, women celebrated the creation of an office that would address gender inequalities and empower women on campus and in the community.\\r\\n\\r\\nForty years later, more women than men are enrolled at IU. Yet around the country, gender is still a polarizing political issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Think about the current political climate,” Alex-Assensoh said. “Rush Limbaugh calls women ‘sluts’ on national radio, and women’s health care issues are still hotly debated. We need to not stand still but be vigilant for women in society.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen OWA was created, many female faculty members couldn’t get hired as full-time professors and were fighting for salary equity. The office still deals with issues of discrimination on campus, but in the last four years, it’s also expanded to provide women with resources for leadership and advancement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOWA frequently coordinates Lunch and Learn sessions that bring women together for conversations about finding a work/life balance, estate planning and caring for elderly parents. Alex-Assensoh said that, sometimes, the discussions from these sessions spawn something bigger.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndi Gitelson, an academic advisor for the College of Arts and Sciences, was talking with other women at a session in 2009 about the need for an outlet for working moms on campus. IU Working Moms started meeting for monthly lunches around Bloomington as a safe place for moms to take a break from the stresses of work and life, and to share their stories and questions.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When do you ever have time to do that as a full-time working parent?” Gitelson asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIUWM has expanded to 115 members thanks to OWA’s financial support. Its biggest accomplishment has been working with OWA to establish six lactation rooms across campus for working moms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOWA also reaches out to students. The office advocated and funded the online sexual assault education program, Sexual Assault Edu, that’s now mandatory for all incoming freshmen, and they also sponsor the Women In Science Program for female students studying math, science and technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, OWA and WSP are partnering to sponsor a new science, technology and math-themed residence hall floor for 50 undergraduate women.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlex-Assensoh said women think of OWA a place to have their concerns heard. OWA supports female faculty as they apply for tenure and promotions, and it handles unhealthy environments in their departments.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile OWA has had successes during the last 40 years, the women of OWA said there’s still a lot of work to be done. Alex-Assensoh noted female students comprise the majority of the student body, but fewer than 10 women have served as student body presidents, and sexual assault on campus is still commonplace.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the questions about OWA’s future, Alex-Assensoh said the office has carried on with its usual programming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The team here hasn’t slowed down,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Under this situation, you’d expect people to stop coming to work, but they’ve been real troopers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the advisory board meeting ended, the women broke into separate groups to discuss different projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoard member Patricia Crouch, an office staff member for the psychology department, mentioned the message on a T-shirt she learned about at a Girls Inc. annual meeting, which read: “my brother helps me with math because I’m too pretty.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCrouch said with the attacks on women’s issues in the news, it’s even more important for groups such as OWA to exist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My first reaction is that it’s implying that the concerns of women aren’t important enough to have their own office,” Crouch said. “Especially in the year of the 40th anniversary, that’s definitely sending a message that this doesn’t have importance.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Crimson and Cream dropped out of the IU Student Association 2012 election Tuesday night. Hours after the public debate, two members of the former ticket, freshmen Yuqing (Kate) Jiao and Brady Bair formally relinquished their positions in an email to presidential candidate Duane Thompson.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Basically, I had two of my running mates who all felt the uphill climb was too much for them,” Thompson said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThompson said he called Head of Election Commission Evan Farrell and Movement for IUSA presidential candidate junior Kyle Straub to notify them of his decision after 10 p.m. Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crimson and Cream ticket had turned in their application to the Election Commission two minutes before the 5 p.m. Sunday write-in deadline. As a write-in option on the ballot, its name was not going to be on the ballots for Election Day. The ticket was composed of three freshmen and two juniors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m glad to get this over with,” Thompson said. “I understand I pushed them to join, and I could never ensure the practicality of our success.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Thompson said he has not given up hope. He plans to join the Movement for IUSA ticket in some capacity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kyle graciously extended his hand for us to work with his ticket,” Thompson said.\\r\\n\\r\\nStraub said he plans to meet with Thompson and the other members of his ticket who are still interested in getting involved with IUSA this week to discuss their future involvement in more detail.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told him I very much respect your effort,” Straub said. “They did bring up some good ideas, like the issues for international student involvement.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThompson said he is unsure what his role will be in Movement for IUSA.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope to mesh both of our campaigns and be the greatest source of light as possible on campus,” Thompson said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThompson said he still hopes some of the initiatives he discussed at the debate will be incorporated into the new administration, such as using liquid ozone as a cleaning agent, creating vocational opportunities for students, adding more IU logos to campus and adding more seminars about stereotypes and sexual assault.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThese events will not affect the pre-planned schedule the Commission created, Farrell said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMovement for IUSA completely revamped their campaign Sunday after Crimson and Cream members announced their intent to run.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have been on a rollercoaster the last week,” Straub said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMovement members plan to continue explaining their initiatives during all other campaign efforts before the election, rather than basic information about IUSA. \\r\\n\\r\\n“Honestly, at this point, we’re going to run off that energy,” Straub said. “It lit a fire under us to prove ourselves to campus.” \\r\\n\\r\\nDebate highlights\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the flip of a coin, Straub was chosen to make opening remarks on behalf of his ticket. Tuesday night, the two tickets faced off in a public debate.\\r\\n\\r\\nMovement responded to the question “What do you think is the most concerning issue on campus and how do you plan to address it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“IU does not embrace the culture of care,” Straub said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of suicides and drinking and drug–related incidents that have occurred in the last year could have been prevented, Straub said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth tickets responded  to a question about the Indiana Daily Student opinion\\r\\narticle “Why aren’t we raising hell?” in Tuesday’s paper, “How would you formulate a response to this article?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is a huge disconnect (between the student body and IUSA),” said junior Crimson and Cream vice president of administration candidate Claire Hawkins.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at the audience, they’re wearing jeans. The current administration you see is in suits. Maybe they’re not students. We’re wearing jeans and are students, and we will solve this disconnect.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMovement answered following Crimson and Cream’s response.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just to clarify, we are all students,” Straub said. “But there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes. I encourage you to do more investigation.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Truong Vu, owner of Pink Nail Salon on East Third Street, was found guilty of sexually assaulting two of his customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2008, two women reported to police two separate incidents that occurred within eight days of one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victims did not know each other, but their accounts were strikingly similar: They began with a body massage and ended in Vu groping or fondling them. Both alleged assaults took place when the salon neared closing time, in a room designated for waxing, after Vu locked the doors. Both women were brunettes, in their twenties and short. One client was 5 feet tall, the other 5-foot-1-inch.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2009, Vu was held on bail for $40,000.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The defendant had a plan and a pattern,” prosecutor Rebecca Veidlinger said in her closing statement. “He thought he could get away with it again. He identified his victims, isolated them and then sexually assaulted them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the end of the three-day trial in the Monroe Circuit Court, Vu testified on his own behalf and denied that he had sexually assaulted his customers. Instead, he claimed that the customers consented to the massages and said one of the clients even requested a massage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jury returned and the defendant remained expressionless as he was found guilty on all four felony counts, including criminal deviate conduct, criminal confinement, sexual battery and criminal confinement. He will receive his sentencing April 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the women said she was constrained as Vu inserted one or two fingers into her vagina and touched her anus. The other customer said he spanked her bottom and rubbed her breasts as his hands were inside her bra.\\r\\n\\r\\nA video recording of Vu’s questioning with Detective Rick Crussen and Lt. David Drake was played for the jury.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I took note that he knew what the complaint was immediately,” Crussen said during the trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn court, as he watched himself on the video, Vu appeared nervous.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some points he turned his head away from the screen and fidgeted around in his seat. His knees shook.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Dec. 31, 2008, taping, Crussen said he only told Vu that there had been a complaint.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, in the video, he knew exactly what the complaint was.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew it had something to do with the “birthday girl” and a body massage.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the victims was celebrating her 21st birthday, and Vu said he gave her a discount and only charged her for a manicure though she received a pedicure, which was interrupted with a massage. Her toenails were never painted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the video, Crussen admitted to kissing one of the victims’ necks, but said since they were friends it wasn’t anything sexual.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t believe she complained,” Vu said. “Right now, I’m scared.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCrussen in the video then asked about an incident reported by the second victim, who said her butt had been spanked and he had said “You like that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is this the kind of behavior young girls want when they come in your salon,” Crussen asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I just tapped her,” Vu said. “We were talking.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the trial, Vu said he had lightly tapped her bottom to wake her up since he claimed she had fallen asleep during the full body massage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tape, Crussen noted the similarities between the victims.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The girls looked so much alike,” he said. “They could have been sisters ... You didn’t give a 55-year-old or 250-pound woman massages.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA nervous chuckle escaped Vu’s mouth. “See where I’m going here?” the detective said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrussen asked if Vu’s massage practices were done on any other customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nVu said the night before the questioning, he had given one to a young, blonde girl with long hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You choose girls you can overpower and can take back to the room,” Crussen said. “And you choose girls you are attracted to.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVu then said he didn’t understand Crussen’s claim.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response, Crussen said, “When you were on the phone yesterday (with one of the victims during a recorded conversation) you spoke in good English.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier in the video he said, “I tried to be friendly and make my customers happy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe repeated this assertion in court on the stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nVu claimed that he carried one of the victims to the waxing room for that reason — to be as helpful to his clients as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I try to be nice to all my customers,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis attorney John-Paul Isom asked if Vu’s client was alright with him carrying her to the back room. He said yes, and when he was asked why he chose to carry her, Vu responded, “I didn’t want to see her walk on the floor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on cross-examination, Veidlinger asked him why he would pick her up if her toenails had no color on them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She said her boyfriend did not treat her right,” he responded.\\r\\n\\r\\nVeidlinger said the reality was that he carried her to a locked room without her consent, and then when she was on the massaging table, he wrapped his arm around her neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile holding her down, he touched her anus and penetrated her vagina with his fingers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the defendant’s concluding statements, the attorney remarked that there was not enough tangible evidence to convict Vu of the crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is not enough physical evidence,” Isom said. “There were no signs of redness, abrasions, examinations or torn clothing ... Why didn’t the women push to get out, and once they did get out of the room, why wouldn’t they run out into the streets and scream bloody murder?”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Viedlinger’s closing argument, she said there are no criteria for what sexual assault looks like.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just because she’s not kicking and screaming doesn’t mean it’s not sexual assault,” Viedlinger said. “Those are myths. Let’s accept that she was showing she did not consent.”',\n",

He said, pointedly, “You’re only as safe as the situation you put yourself in.” I agreed wholeheartedly, and we moved on to discuss something else.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking back a month or so later, I became extremely disturbed by this casual exchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur conversation missed the crux of the issue, which is that the Lauren Spierer tragedy even happened in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis represents a heartbreaking failure on the part of the community to prevent situations like this from happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, it’s obvious each of us is responsible for the decisions we make, but it is warped and dangerous logic to imply we are in any way responsible for the actions of others or harm that others do to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere needs to be a fundamental change in our current dialogue about abduction and other assault crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation shouldn’t revolve around the questions we’ve all heard: “Why was he/she alone? Why did she/he leave her friends and wander off? Why did she leave with that guy? How much did he/she drink? Did he/she have a drug problem?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conversation needs to focus on far more poignant and relevant questions: “Where were his/her friends? Why wasn’t anyone watching out for him/her? Why hasn’t the perpetrator been found? What is happening in our community and culture at large that makes it acceptable for us to allow something like this to happen?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the questions we need to be asking because, frankly, the first set of questions engages in the vile and regressive act of blaming the victim for the transgression committed against him or her.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s instead question the motives of the culprit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must work together as a community to prevent these things from happening but not through programs that emphasize preventative safety measure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf programs that stress not going out alone and not drinking excessively really prevented assault crimes, then we wouldn’t still be having this discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese individuals know what they’re doing and are able to get away with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur current dialogue of rape is not only unsuccessful for preventing assault but facilitates it by taking the pressure off the most important people in this equation: the culprits.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictims do not have motives to be victimized. No one wants to be a victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the current mainstream language we have to discuss abduction, assault, rape and abuse fixates on the victim’s behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to work toward a more positive, supportive and community-driven discussion about preventing abduction, sexual assault, rape and other crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— ccleahy@indiana.edu',\n",

Robert Downey Jr., Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and the late Amy Winehouse are just a few examples of people we’ve watched rise and fall through the years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing gets us going more than a flux in the lives of the privileged, except perhaps toddler beauty pageants and octo-moms.\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Brown’s fall from grace was notable, however, in its remarkably different treatment. He didn’t enter rehab for drug abuse or have a public feud with Kanye West. Three years ago, the night before the 2009 Grammys, Chris Brown, 19 years old at the time, sent his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, to the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown pleaded guilty to a felony assault and was blacklisted from the awards ceremony for the following two years. Shockingly, after such an undeniable black mark on someone’s record as a very public conviction of assault, Brown’s “triumphant” return to the Grammy stage this year was that of a prodigal son.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grammy stage welcomed Brown with open arms and three nominations, as well as one win for best R&B album. \\r\\n\\r\\nTwitter was buzzing with activity on the night of the awards show, as well, with much commentary centered around Brown. Most of it was positive, if disturbingly misguided, support for the singer. While some criticized his place on the Grammy stage at all, other Twitter users jumped to Brown’s defense, trending #teambreezy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “adversity” Brown had seemingly “overcome,” however, was not like the struggles of our other comeback kids.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown’s violent behavior cannot be excused and forgiven the same way we absolve other celebrities of addictions, weight gain and bad albums.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the late singer Amy Winehouse. Struggling to cope with her rapid rise to fame, Winehouse repeatedly succumbed to alcoholism, substance abuse and depression. Winehouse embodied an honest, precarious talent, but her deteriorating mental and physical health led to her death at 27 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public didn’t hesitate to criticize Winehouse. Her actions were not excused or defended but rather mocked and ridiculed. Following her death, people posted online live videos of her final performances when crowds in Serbia booed her offstage.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, why do we, as a culture, seem to regard our female celebrities in a much harsher light?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe return of male entertainers such as Brown and Eminem, another performer who has openly grappled with anger management problems and domestic violence, have been welcomed to the spotlight free of charge.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, MTV announced that Rihanna and Chris Brown had collaborated on a remix of her single “Birthday Cake.” Following the absurd hook of the word “cake” repeated ad infinitum, Brown lends his vocals to a sexually explicit, sadly problematic verse. \\r\\n\\r\\nA finely calculated publicity stunt, the collaboration felt almost inevitable. What would get the public’s attention faster than exploiting a violent relationship? I hope I am not alone in refusing to so readily accept Brown’s exoneration.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— alliston@indiana.edu',\n",

Watching them complete projects, she soon realized art therapy had incredible benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was so excited I was there,” Bornstein said. “Even when I was tired in the morning and I didn’t want to go, I would always leave feeling so great. Art was a way for them to express themselves, and it was different than what they had growing up.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the summer concluded, Bornstein decided she wanted to start working with children in a similar way, either by joining an existing art program or by doing something a little more daunting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was going to start one,” Bornstein said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter joining Middle Way House, Bornstein began raising money on her own for art supplies. She reached out to family and friends, specifically through an Amazon Wish List. \\r\\n\\r\\nThough the supplies were limited at first, Bornstein said she saw immediate changes with the participants, many of whom had behavioral disorders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The ones who usually weren’t listening will listen during art time,” she said. “Or those who don’t talk, that are more reserved, they will talk and be engaged during art time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBornstein said one of the greatest challenges of her involvement in the program is setting boundaries with the kids. After all, she wanted them to work around their challenges, not be punished for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said some days are particularly brutal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Once in a while, you have a day with just you and 30 kids, and you’re like, ‘What am I thinking? Why am I here?’” she said. “Then you have the good days and you’re like,\\r\\n‘That’s why.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Live Big Scholarship rewards efforts to improve a student’s community. After picking five finalists from each Big Ten school, online voting began in which people could choose their favorite volunteer. The results will be announced at tonight’s IU men’s basketball game.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Bornstein isn’t worried about who won — after all, she’s preoccupied with hopes of being accepted to the social work program at Washington University in St. Louis.\\r\\n \\r\\nA genuine sense of indifference and an eyes-on-the-prize mentality echoes in her every word.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t think I won,” she said with a shrug. “It’s fine. I think it was kind of a ‘who-knows-the-most-people-contest.’ My goal was more to let everyone in the University know about the art program. And people did end up emailing me, expressing interest.”',\n",

Women are no longer used as baby factories because they have unlimited access to abortion-on-demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen are no longer sexually repressed because now they can hit the club and sleep with as many men as they want.\\r\\n\\r\\nIgnoring for a moment that these are questionable summaries of what the feminist movement wanted, and wants, to attain, we should first address one simple fact: these are lies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen someone tells you that men and women are now equal, they are lying to your face.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen remain a subjugated class in America, and though they are perhaps better off than their grandmothers, they remain far from the promised land of perfect equality.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s discuss the three points made by our holier-than-thou anti-feminist friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s true that there are now laws against job discrimination against women. You can’t fire someone simply for being a woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe courts have repeatedly ruled, however, that it’s perfectly legal to fire a woman for not being pretty enough, for acting too masculine or for failing to act like the office mother and prepare meals and parties for her male co-workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen are now allowed in the workplace, but only on the condition they are present as women and not as equal co-workers. And we can’t forget women in the same jobs as men make significantly less money and are often denied promotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut women’s work doesn’t end in the office. When they get home, women continue to do the vast majority of housework, food preparation and child care — even women who are in ostensibly equal marriages with progressive men.\\r\\n\\r\\nTired from a long day at the office, men come home, drink a beer and watch television. Women, just as exhausted, come home to dirty dishes, crying children and a husband expecting a home-cooked meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, women who don’t want families are just as attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery day conservative lawmakers from both parties are attacking abortion rights in this country. While Roe v. Wade made abortion legal, it hasn’t stopped anti-choice politicians from restricting abortion rights in dozens of states.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen are forced to view ultrasounds or listen to false statistics about supposed links between abortion and cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven President Barack Obama has shown contempt for women’s control over their own bodies by prohibiting the sale of Plan B medication to minors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this shouldn’t surprise us, as we live in a culture where women’s control over their own bodies is considered a joke. More than a third of women are raped in their lifetimes, but the arrest rate for rape is less than a third of the arrest rate for murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictims of rape are mocked, told they wouldn’t have been assaulted if they hadn’t been acting like sluts. Our society blames the victim, telling her to drink less or be more careful or dress more conservatively, ignoring the fact that it was a man who raped her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not justice. This is not equality.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen have made gains toward legal equality with men, though there are still massive gaps. They are far from being substantively equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember this the next time someone tells you feminism is dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— atcrane@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The often unexpected obstacle for many women is other women.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompetition between women is a familiar trope. It’s the kind of ill-will that made Mean Girls quotes famous, but it’s also the reality of American women’s lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nI won’t be writing for the IDS for a while, so I wanted to give readers a project until I return.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project is called Finding Female Solidarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nDudes, you’re getting a free pass for now because I don’t know much about competition between men except for the fact that my brother likes to play League of Legends with his friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor women, though, competition, especially competition over mates, has been framed as an evolutionary inevitability.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing about evolution is, what is evolutionarily advantageous can change.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I fail to see a convincing argument for continued female in-fighting and mean girl behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingle women now have the means to support themselves — economically, legally, emotionally, sexually. For many women, basic survival is no longer contingent on the men in their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in a society that too often values women as things instead of people, the false logic of infighting persists.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly by being a better object, a better accessory, can we be appreciated by a society that still doesn’t have a functional understanding of the female reproductive system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis breeds not only the obvious psychological problems of low self-esteem and body image problems, but it also undermines women’s ability to form strong bonds with other women.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy competing with other women over looks, over status, over men, we are complicit in our own oppression.\\r\\n\\r\\nEncouraging women to value the superficial, then, is a way to encourage the patriarchy. And we’re buying into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI buy into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt takes work to stop competing. Sometimes I catch myself judging other women for their booty shorts or their hair cut or their piercings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes I catch myself wondering how someone who looks like that could ever have someone so wonderful, handsome and kind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I do catch it, and I try and unpack why I feel the way I do. Why do I care what someone else is wearing or who they’re dating?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s never a good reason. It’s always petty and destructive.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently a friend told me about someone she knows’ trip to the gas station.\\r\\n\\r\\nA stranger approached her and touched her ass. She responded by pushing him away, and he slapped her in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis girl was sexually harassed and physically assaulted, but those present did nothing for her but shrug their shoulders and suggest she wear less revealing clothing.\\r\\nImagine how alone she felt. Imagine how helpless she felt. Imagine how you would feel in that situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of us don’t have to imagine, because something similar has happened to us.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow imagine if she had another woman there who would stand with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the grand scheme of things, who’s wearing what or dating whom isn’t important.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporting other women in our common struggle for respect and equality is.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have our assignment.

       "  'body': 'Max Scripture walked down Kirkwood Avenue, tightening his thick-striped tie around his neck to shield himself from the frigid air.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter reaching the brick sidewalk on the corner of Washington and Kirkwood, he stopped. The Sample Gates were visible down the road, fewer than four blocks away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is where it happened,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo weeks before, Scripture, an IU senior, was assaulted and beaten to the ground by a stranger for being gay.\\r\\n\\r\\nScripture said he was bar-hopping with his friend, senior Sydni Phelan, and others, celebrating the start of Thanksgiving break. They started at Kilroy’s on Kirkwood, making their way to the Dunnkirk after. By the time Scripture left for Sports, it was around 1 a.m.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhelan, a life-long friend of Scripture, said he and his friend, senior Tony Skelton, fell far behind the group, out of sight.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be at least another hour until she saw Scripture again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Scripture walked with Skelton, a stranger from behind shouted, “Wow, those jeans really make you look like a faggot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A guy tried to antagonize Max because he is gay,” Skelton said. “They only picked on him, not me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nScripture, who has been openly gay since his senior year of high school, said he has dealt with ignorant comments about his sexuality in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned around and told the man to shut up, but was urged to walk away by Skelton.  \\r\\n\\r\\n“The guy screamed, ‘I wasn’t done talking to you’,” Scripture said. “I only turned halfway around before he decked me in the face. I hit the concrete. Hard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nScripture posted a picture of his bloodied face to his Instagram later that night. Next to it was a snapshot of the man Scripture said attacked him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cheers to the douche bag that found it necessary to sucker punch me to the concrete for being a homosexual,” he wrote in the caption. “It’s 2013 and your ignorance is beyond ridiculous.”  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe image received 128 likes.\\r\\n\\r\\nScripture never went to the hospital. He never called the police.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FBI classifies an assault motivated by a person’s bias toward a particular race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity or gender as a hate crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IU Police Department publishes statistics on hate crimes in its annual security report. IUPD is required by the Clery Act and the Higher Education Opportunity Act to make the University’s procedures, practices and crimes available for public access.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Scripture decided not to report his attack, it won’t be listed in IUPD’s security report.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Most of the hate crimes we’ve recorded at IU fall into the intimidation or vandalism category,” IUPD Lieutenant Craig Munroe said. “If incidents aren’t reported to us, we have no way of responding to them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year’s report stated that zero assaults motivated by bias occurred in the past year. The only hate crimes on record include one 2011 assault motivated by racial bias and fewer than 20 instances of vandalism from 2010 through 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nMunroe said he takes comfort in the small number of incidents recorded in this year’s security report.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would report a crime that happened to me,” he said, “but I can’t speak for others.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOther entities serve to address hate crime and discrimination on IU’s campus. Four IU incident teams operate year-round: disability, gender, racial and religious, and gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender. Each of the four teams are comprised of faculty and staff with expertise in diversity issues and conflict resolution.     \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bloomington Human Rights Commission serves as a sounding board for victims of hate incidents. It publishes an annual incident report, with details for each particular case.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the report only cites incidents made known to the commission which, according to BHRC Director Barbara McKinney, may not be an accurate representation of the amount of hate crime occurring in Bloomington.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would guess that many hate incidents go unreported for a variety of reasons,” she said. “Just as many rapes don’t get reported.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the last three years, the BHRC has reported between 11 to 18 incidents annually.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcKinney began tracking hate incidents in the early 1990s after receiving phone calls in her office about incidents motivated by bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BHRC incident report has been a sounding board for victims of hate incidents for more than a decade. IUPD launched a full-scale investigation when the BHRC reported in April last year that someone scrawled “Hitler” and a swastika on a Jewish studies poster in Goodbody Hall.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an individual calls the BHRC, McKinney and her team will refer them to the police. At that point, the victim can pursue charges and officially declare the incident as a hate crime.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If there are any details about an incident, I want to hear them,” McKinney said.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nThe assault left Scripture with a swollen and cut lip. He said his tooth sliced through the inside of his mouth, causing it to bleed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After the attack, everyone was saying I needed to press charges,” he said. “I was pissed. We didn’t even know if I should go to the hospital or not, so I just left it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSkelton and two strangers took Scripture to his apartment, where they debated taking him to the hospital. Scripture said they watched his head for signs of trauma, but decided he would be fine without medical attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout an hour later, Scripture left his apartment to find his friends at Sports. He said the same stranger who punched him was present at the bar.  Scripture proceeded to give him the middle finger and attempt to have him removed from the premises.  \\r\\n\\r\\nScripture was drinking, but he said it wasn’t enough to impair his ability to function or remember.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve never even had anyone or anything come close to this incident,” he said. “It really shocked me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked why he never reported his attack, Scripture stared quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was two weeks after the incident, and his lip and face were completely healed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not worrying about if someone knows about it,” he said. “It happened so fast, he was already gone before I could do anything.”  \\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Matt Bloom on Twitter @matthew_bloom.',\n",

       "  'body': 'In a column published a few weeks ago, IndyStar columnist Bill Stanczykiewicz discusses the horrifying facts and statistics about infant mortality rates in Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\n“According to the updated Kids Count in Indiana Data Book, in 2011 the number of babies who died in the first year of life was 643, similar to the number of students in two elementary schools.” This number leads to Indiana’s infant mortality rate being 25 percent higher than the national average.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanczykiewicz goes on to explore possible reasons why the mortality rate might be so high, but it’s actually a letter to the editor from Carolyn Meagher and Sue Ellen Braunlin, co-presidents of Indiana Religious Coalition for Reproductive Justice, that offers the most immediate, sound and easily-implemented solution: sex education.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith proper prenatal care and general knowledge about the risks of sexual activity, Indiana’s outrageously high infant mortality rate could be solved almost instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’ve picked up a copy of the Indiana Daily Student before this one, you know that the Opinion staff loves talking about sex — only sometimes in the raunchy sense, but mostly about sex education.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few weeks ago, the IDS Editorial Board had to publish a piece about putting on condoms the correct way because a study at the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction exposed just how little people knew about the contraceptives. To just get the obvious out there, improper use of condoms is the fastest way to unwanted pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Monday, IDS Opinion columnist Caroline Ellert came to the defense of HIV/AIDS victims and the stigma around them — another conflict linked to the lack of sexual education.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, HIV/AIDS has incredible potential to contribute to the infant mortality rate. According to AIDS.gov, an HIV-positive mother who is not being treated for her HIV during pregnancy, labor or delivery has a 25-percent chance of passing the virus to her baby.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault on campus seems like a blasé side note because we see it reported so many times. Throughout the semester, the IDS reported incidents of rape on campus a total of six times. I think we can all agree that’s an incredibly high number when dealing with a subject such as rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough rape isn’t necessarily a part of the general sex education curriculum, it is linked to a general discussion and teachable definition of consensual sex and what that entails.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is beginning to look like a sort of button on all the work we’ve done this semester.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there have been plenty of on-campus incidents that we could explore further.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrother Jeb and the abortion protestors using “photographs” of bloody babies all work to uphold the Indiana ideal that it’s best to just not have sex — a truly dangerous mindset.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issues are all there and have seemed to remain stagnant for too long.\\r\\n\\r\\nImproper sex education leads to bringing a baby into a world that might not be fit or supportive of him or her. And this is the fastest route to infant mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe this new rationale will spark some real change.\\r\\n\\r\\n— sjostrow@indiana.edu\\r\\nFollow columnist Sam Ostrowski on Twitter @ostrowski_s_j.',\n",

I want us competing with each other rather than against each other.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJordan welcomed his own replacement, Russ Siadatian.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For my upcoming goals, there is one big, overall theme, getting general members on the same page as all of us,” Siadatian said. “Both how we feel about the fraternity system and greek life in general.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSiadatian said he hopes the greek system will move forward as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have to come together as a community,” Siadatian said. “This upcoming year is a big year for the greek community.

       "  'body': 'Bloomington’s Middle Way House volunteers like Tempestt Walker aren’t allowed beyond the large set of double doors marked, “secured entrance only.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sign is on the doors at the end of a long orange hallway – a hallway that secures the women and children who are victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Tempestt has never met any of the women, even though she has volunteered at the house since February 2013. She simply types their names into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and files their court documents.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We call them survivors,” she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nTempestt is a sort of survivor herself. A senior first-generation college student, she plans to graduate in May with a degree in public health. Tempestt, along with nearly 2,200 other students at IU, is the first in her family to attend college. Neither her mother, father, nor three older siblings successfully completed higher education. She says a lot of students like her struggle to remain in school long enough to graduate. They often succumb to intense academic demands of college-level courses, financial strains, or social pressures.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At first, we’re scared to ask for help,” Tempestt says. “Everyone automatically assumes that you know what to do. You made it here, so you should have the work ethic and you know how to succeed in college. When actually you don’t. You’re going to struggle.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIU students across the state face an alarmingly low graduation rate – 57 percent – for those who enrolled in 2006 and received a degree in six years or less, according to graduation rates published by the University Institutional Research and Reporting office. From the same group, only 35 percent of bachelor’s degree-seeking students graduated in four years. Mary Tourner, director of Groups, an advising and financial aid support program for first-generation college students, says it is more difficult to keep students in school due to familial and financial burdens. The graduation rate of first-generation college students is even less than the University-wide statistic. Mary says it is somewhere around 40 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These students come to campus with the odds against them,” she says.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nTempestt is from Indianapolis, a hotbed of recruitment for first-generation college students. She’s soft-spoken yet determined, and she knows what she wants. The 21-year-old blends into the mass of students studying at Herman B Wells Library with her blue checkered scarf and pink North Face jacket. She will graduate, and nothing will stop her, she says. Her mom always stressed the importance of education, yet her older siblings managed to avoid college. Her oldest brother left high school for the streets.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He felt like he was making enough money on the streets, so he never went back to school,” Tempestt says. Her older brother and sister both received GEDs but haven’t found the time to finish college while working full-time. Tempestt says negative influences like drugs and alcohol never got in the way of her pursuing a college degree.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see a lot of people back home that struggle — family and friends. I saw college as an opportunity to not be like that. I’m here (in college) for a purpose – to get exactly where I want to go.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, Tempestt has never let her academics fall short. Her determination was tested during her sophomore year when her 2003 Pontiac Grand Am broke down – limiting her transportation to and from class. She lived far enough away from campus to where it made it harder to balance classes and work. She thought for a moment about taking a semester off to save up for a new car.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Taking a semester off meant I may never come back,” she says.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she stayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stayed so she can graduate and become a lawyer to help victims of sexual assault like the ones at the Middle Way House.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stayed so she could support her family back home.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nJuan Cano, codirector of multicultural outreach recruitment at the IU Admissions office, sits at a small desk in the corner of an upstairs room. This is only one of three jobs he uses to support himself while at school. Currently in his fifth year, Juan plans to graduate in May and attend graduate school for education. He says dealing with the social adjustment of college was the least of his problems as a first-generation college student.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dealing with the life going on back home was hardest for me,” Juan says, sitting back in his plastic rolling chair. “I had to become the provider for my family.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJuan’s father started calling, asking for money when his bank account filled with thousands in scholarship funds from the 21st Century Scholars program and Groups. Then, Juan’s uncle, the same uncle who cried over the phone when he found out his nephew was going to college, asked for his help financing treatment for kidney cancer.\\r\\n“It really burdens you,” Juan says.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Juan is happy with his role as the provider. He wants to make sure more high school students have the opportunity to be the first in their families to get a college degree. He smiles as he talks about giving his SAT prep books to his younger brother, a junior in high school.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiving high school students access to a higher education hasn’t been the problem for IU. In Indianapolis, the majority of Ben Davis High School’s student body is composed of first-generation students. IU offer thousands of dollars in financial aid specifically for first-generation students. Yet, less than half of the first-generation class of 2014 will receive diplomas come May.\\r\\n\\r\\nMartin McCrory, vice provost for educational inclusion and diversity, has worked at the University for almost two decades, focusing the majority of his effort on improving the environment for first-generation college students. A first-generation student himself, he knows first-hand the obstacles they face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They never unpack their suitcases because they’re always traveling back and forth from home on the weekends,” Martin says. “This isn’t home for them. This is a foreign land.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “suitcase kids,” as Martin calls them, are alienated on campus. He and his staff at the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs are teaming up with leaders and offices around IU to help make students feel more at home, and more likely to stay and graduate. Martin leads regular focus groups that work to break the barrier between the administration and student body.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s my goal to make you believe that you are somebody – that this is your home and you deserve to be at IU,” Martin says.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe says his job is what keeps him awake at night, thinking about ways to create more opportunities for students that need help.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll create them,” Martin says. “Or I’ll die trying.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'When reporter Nathan Brown asked to publish a story illustrating the reality of IU’s binge-drinking culture for many students on campus, a practice that is notoriously encouraged during tailgates, I was sold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat idea formulated into our front-page story, “Another drunken Saturday.” We knew the story would raise questions and hopefully encourage people to reflect on their own decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the piece appeared in print and online, my inbox has been flooded with email — several supporting the story, and others calling it a direct attack on IU’s greek community. Then the IDS’ Twitter feed filled with #FollowThisGreek tweets.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda, whose last name was not published to protect her from punishment, is in fact a member of the greek community, but that is not the primary focus of the story. As a student at an American university, she is part of a culture of dangerous alcohol consumption, where 37.4 percent of college students say they binge drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis culture of beer bongs and keg stands exists not only in greek houses, but also on Kirkwood Avenue, in off-campus house parties and in residence halls. No one social group can be excluded, and that includes the Indiana Daily Student staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur intention with printing the story was to illustrate how frightening our interactions with alcohol can be, and we succeeded. Speaking in hushed tones, IU students often discuss how wasted they got the night before, laughing off their memory loss and aversion to loud noises. When such behavior is laid out in print, and when you realize someone else’s life mirrors your own or someone’s you know, it hits home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda is not alone, and we hope our story helps our readers put their actions into perspective before our community is plagued with another alcohol-related death or injury.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome believe the IDS will do anything to soil the name of the greek community. Our actual priority, however, is to tell stories objectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough “Another drunken Saturday” can be perceived as negative coverage, it was not an indictment of the greek system. Moreover, the story is one among dozens from this semester concerning the greek community. These stories include the Interfraternity Council’s training to recognize and intervene in situations of sexual assault, Big Man on Campus coverage and greeks’ involvement in IU Dance Marathon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the semester progresses, we will continue reporting the news — not as a public relations firm, but as an objective news source that delivers readers information they need to know. In the meantime, tweet #FollowThisGreek, and we’ll pay attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— mkeierle@indiana.edu\\r\\nFollow Editor-in-Chief Mark Keierleber on Twitter @mkeierleber.',\n",

Maybe. But maybe not when you consider that almost everyone reading this knows someone who has been sexually assaulted. Some might even be survivors themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network, someone is sexually assaulted in the United States every two minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’ve been reading the Indiana Daily Student lately, you’ve seen stories about reported rapes on or near campus.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you’re me, you’re infuriated because you realize we aren’t doing enough to raise awareness of sexual assault and rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are conversations about the nature of consent. “No means no,” we’re told.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we have to move beyond that — we have to confront the cultural narratives that make rape possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarshall University’s Women’s Center defines rape culture as “an environment in which rape is prevalent and in which sexual violence against women is normalized and excused in the media and popular culture.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that environment, men are judged by their sexual prowess and women by their usefulness as sexual objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen and women are reduced to caricatures that make them little more than objects — one acting upon the other — ruled by their sexual organs and nothing else.\\r\\n\\r\\nI write this as a cisgendered woman of mixed racial background.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perspectives of transgendered women, of women of color, of queer individuals and of male victims of sexual assault must be considered whenever discussing rape if we’re ever to have an honest dialogue about the issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs do the perspectives of straight men. A student in one of my classes once said he wanted to talk about the issue but was never sure how to approach it because he felt as if he was always placed in the role of the potential rapist.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of us are framed by this cultural understanding of sex that traps men and women at either end of a binary — one always the victim of, the prey of, in fear of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging that narrative — working to understand rape culture and to change it — that’s what I mean when I say we have to move beyond “no means no.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI started this piece with a memory that was created because my friends didn’t want me alone with a man because he might rape me.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know too many stories where you can replace “might” with “did.” The friend who was the victim of a serial rapist. The woman who lost her virginity when she was date raped at 15.\\r\\n\\r\\nRape is not an issue that will go away by ignoring it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way to deal with the issue is to talk about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo talk openly and honestly talk about consent but also about all the narratives that create a culture in which rape is seen has something that just happens, not as the crime it is.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— rompenni@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Interfraternity Council members are learning techniques to prevent, recognize and intervene in situations of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault Program is an educational program for greek men that teaches them about sexual assault and how to recognize or stop it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MARS program was created spring 2013 by senior Grant Ryan, IFC vice president of membership development, along with Debbie Melloan and Mark Houlemarde from the Sexual Assault Crisis Center of the IU Health Center.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The amount of sexual assaults that have been occurring in the greek community are alarming and terrible,” Ryan said. “I wanted to create a program that would combat this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IFC Presidents’ Council made the program mandatory. Each of the 33 IFC chapters are required to have two members complete this program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been about two sessions this semester, and several sessions were offered last spring. Ryan said IFC is pushing for sophomores to attend this training.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Internal elections are coming up for each chapter,” Ryan said. “I really want the future executive boards to have this training and be knowledgeable in this area.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHoulemarde, a Ph.D. student and outreach coordinator for the Sexual Assault Crisis Center, said the MARS program is an evolution of a previous SACC program, Fraternities Reducing Assault Together, which was created about four years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe educational sessions are four hours long and are taught by Melloan and Houlemarde at fraternity houses such as Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Beta Theta Pi.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoulemarde said even though MARS is relatively new, the program is steadily progressing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re really pushing MARS forward to make some headway,” he said. “We’re making some progress, and we’re currently working to make it a permanent part of the greek community.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program tackles specific aspects of sexual assault, such as separating myths about sexual assault from facts and working through hypothetical scenarios.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoulemarde stressed the importance of integrating the training into the fraternity chapters as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We want to help those representatives bring back useful and valuable things to their communities,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe training gives a realistic representation of sexual assault situations, Houlemarde said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Men can actually play a large part in preventing sexual assault,” he said. “We want them to be active bystanders and be able to intervene during any situation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe training also incorporates recent, real-life incidents of sexual assault and similar situations, such as the Georgia Institute of Technology chapter of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity’s email to its members which condoned forced sexual encounters.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan said he also plans for the MARS program to collaborate with the IU Panhellenic Association’s Safe Sisters Program, a sorority counterpart to the IFC program.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said he hopes the two programs will be able to come together to be host to a joint sexual assault prevention program.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first joint session is planned for early December, Ryan said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said he hopes this program will continue in the coming semesters in addition to the all-male program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he said he believes it would be valuable to attend both programs, the IFC program maintains its value.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sometimes it’s difficult to talk about sexual assault in front of women,” Ryan said. “The strictly men training is valuable, and once they complete that they can move on to the other program.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost 100 men from 32 IFC chapters have completed the training.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If they can stop just one sexual assault from occurring, then they’ve been successful,” Ryan said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRyan also stressed the importance of the program and its teachings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You could intervene in a situation that could potentially ruin the rest of someone’s life,” Ryan said. “These skills they learn are going to be valuable that they can hold on to for the rest of their lives.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Tori Lawhorn on Twitter @ToriLawhorn.',\n",

       "  'body': 'As of Oct. 22, only 12 handles of hard liquor are allowed at greek parties. After midnight, all liquor will be locked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nA handle is equal to about 42 standard 1.5-oz. shots. With the new rules, all greek partygoers will be able to drink a total of about 512 shots before midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new rules were formally introduced at a Joint Gavel discussion between the presidents of all 33 IU fraternities and 21 sororities Oct. 22.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 33 fraternity chapters must now comply with the new alcohol regulations at all of their social events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IFC Presidents’ Council developed the policy, and the IFC Executive Board will enforce it, IFC President Sean Jordan said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe policies were enforced during Homecoming Week as a test run for a program, he said. The final version of these policies is still in the works.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We recognized a lot of unhealthy behavior going on in the greek community and IUB as a whole,” Jordan said. “We want to lower the BACs and promote a healthier culture.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to limit drinks, many fraternities implement bartenders who pour drinks and determine whether party attendees have reached their limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent student deaths might have been a contributing factor, Jordan said, but no single event spurred the changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nJordan said IFC policy already bans underage drinking, but the freshman attendee policy has been reemphasized. No non-greek freshmen, male or female, are allowed at fraternity parties.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is a safety measure,” Jordan said. “Freshmen aren’t accustomed to college, especially greek culture.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlpha Sigma Phi President and sophomore Erik Bailey said the policies address a serious problem with IU’s drinking culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you go to other colleges, you only see beer,” Bailey said. “It’s a problem when you come to IU and see everyone pounding shots.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some fraternity members, the new rules are a step in the right direction. But others say the rules will make the problem even worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe limited drinking time could make drinking more dangerous, said Tau Kappa Epsilon Risk Manager and junior Sam Kapitan.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of the limited time hard alcohol is offered at parties, some greek students believe the regulations could lead to increased pre-gaming before parties.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Parties usually start at 10 p.m., and eventually people will learn that they only have about two hours to drink,” Kapitan said. “People will probably start drinking a lot faster.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLast year, IFC had one weekend each semester where no hard alcohol was allowed. The new regulations are a continuation of that, Jordan said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We aren’t too concerned,” Jordan said. “People might be inclined to drink more, but the number of quantities will be drastically limited.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFraternities are enforcing these rules internally, Jordan said. The IFC Executive Board is asking all chapters to inform the board if they see that other fraternities aren’t upholding the policies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of each chapter’s executive board, along with risk managers and sober brothers and sisters, are observing the parties and enforcing these rules, Jordan said.\\r\\n“We will hold each chapter directly accountable for this,” Jordan said. “We’re going to make ourselves apparent at these functions.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome IFC members, including Bailey and Phi Sigma Kappa President and junior Jimmy Blodget, agree with these new rules.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese new policies stem from the fact that there is a problem on the campus,” Blodget said. “It can be difficult to change a culture overnight, and there could be unintended\\r\\nconsequences.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause these regulations are new, IFC will have to wait to see how all of these factors will play out, Blodget said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“IFC is trying to create a culture of care, and I don’t think anyone can argue that is a good thing for this campus,” Blodget said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBailey also stands in favor of these changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are all trying to create a cultural change at IU, and IFC is going to lead the way with this,” Bailey said. “Hopefully the entire campus will change.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the bartender can help eliminate binge drinking, Kapitan said he is still concerned about pre-gaming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When you only have 12 bottles ... I don’t see how people are going to follow that,” Kapitan said. “I don’t see it working out in the long term. We’ll just have to see how it goes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-gaming is a concern, but Bailey said he thinks it is the sororities’ responsibility not to pre-game beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother concern about the new rules is the storage of hard liquor in bedrooms of  after midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSigma Pi member and senior Peter Hull said he believes the rules will increase unsafe drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If people store hard liquor in their rooms and end up drinking it past midnight, there is no one around to look out for one another,” Hull said. “You can’t cut anyone off.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBailey acknowledged this concern.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When guys have it in their rooms and they invite girls up, it’s a big problem,” Bailey said. “The chance of sexual assault drastically increases.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother concern is the number of upperclassmen who leave at midnight to go to bars to continue drinking, Hull said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At midnight, it’s immediate,” Hull said. “The seniors are gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHull said he believes these changes are a knee-jerk reaction to the recent student deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What happened was awful and tragic, but this is the first time it has happened in years,” Hull said. “These actions are a overreaction.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHull said though he believes pre-gaming will increase, he and his Sigma Pi brothers are prepared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We know how to contact an emergency response team, and we’ll let the sober brothers and sisters know,” Hull said. “That’s the worse case scenario, but houses all over campus need to see this as a potential situation with more pre-gaming.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKapitan said he believes instead of implementing new rules, alcohol education and awareness should be increased.\\r\\n\\r\\n“IFC should partner with IU Health every year and build awareness with each pledge class,” Kapitan said. “The greek community needs to be educated as a whole.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Tori Lawhorn on Twitter @ToriLawhorn.',\n",

Everyone in the United States loves to sue each other for ridiculous reasons. Some girl or guy got drunk at some party and fell and broke a leg? Lawsuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s almost too easy to sue a fraternity. The president and his executive board can be held liable. That’s why fraternities have taken drastic steps to reduce their liability and make events safer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt almost any fraternity event, you will find at least one sober executive. This is the guy who is in charge for the night. He is responsible for everything that goes on and is there to deal with any issues that might arise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe is the one responsible for dealing with your friend who’s puking in the bathroom, or your other friend who’s blacked-out, trying to fight people walking down the street. So if something bad were to happen, there is at least one sober, hopefully responsible and dependable, person there to deal with the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, fraternities have an entire group of people “working” the parties — usually pledges. Typically there are workers posted at the back door to control who is entering and exiting the house and to track how many people are in the house at a given time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, there may be other sober monitors to assist the sober executive in keeping things under control. Sororities regularly provide sober monitors as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut most importantly, most, if not all, fraternities at IU have sober drivers.\\r\\nThis is absolutely essential in ensuring peoples’ safety. This is one of the best services IU’s greek organizations provide.\\r\\nSober drivers work to ensure everyone gets to wherever they need to go, safely. No one needs to drive drunk because there are free rides available.\\r\\nNo one needs to bear the risk of getting arrested from walking home drunk. But most importantly, sober drivers ensure that Hoosiers get home safely and don’t have to face creeps, rapists or murderers while walking home at night.\\r\\nGreeks at IU sometimes receive negative press, but the parties they host are more controlled than some might think.\\r\\nSay what you will about the IU greek system, but there are some sound safety systems in place that people often overlook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— lliskey@indiana.edu\\r\\nFollow columnist\\r\\nLuke Liskey on Twitter\\r\\n@compliant_rogue.',\n",

       "  'body': 'As pledge season gets underway, hundreds of new students are familiarizing themselves with traditions rich in history.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom learning about the organization’s Founding Fathers to the mission of the organization itself, this sort of knowledge is passed down from older members to new ones, ensuring the cycle continues.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast week Georgia Tech saw the perverse side of this process in an internal email sent to members of Pi Kappa Tau, in which the sender — the social events chairman — outlined to new members how to lure women into sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the moronic jewels of advice were how to dance, “ ... let them grind against your dick. After that, slowly alternate between ... your hand across their stomach, but don’t go to high (keep it under the boob) or too low (dont try to finger her ... yet).”\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, Plan B was included if all advice failed. “IF ANYTHING EVER FAILS, GO GET MORE ALCOHOL.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite there being so many stomach-churning things wrong with the email, the most nauseating part of it all is how desensitized we’ve become to this sort of behavior, which is almost expected of fraternities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, we’ve seen a shift in fraternities from their original purpose as selective social clubs to alcohol-fueled factories of men hell-bent on getting laid at any cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcohol has gone from being a lubricant of social interaction to a crutch fraternities depend on to be able to interact with the opposite sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s this misguided and recently created cultural expectation among greeks that seems to be contributing to the prominent role alcohol —\\xad\\xad specifically hard liquor — plays in the social scene of the greek system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis new expectation too often results in preventable tragedies ranging from serious injuries to sexual assaults to even deaths.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, fraternities aren’t the only ones to blame. Sororities that continue to pair with fraternities known to demean women are as complicit in perpetuating a culture dangerous to women as the men who actively devalue them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of administrative accountability, it’s beyond clear that most colleges — including IU — have only reactionary mechanisms to deal with fallout once the damage has been done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greek system is a beast even administrators can’t directly control, which is why so much of the responsibility to educate falls on the laps of student leaders in positions of power inside fraternities and sororities.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, when you have leaders like the social chair of the Georgia Tech fraternity, the future doesn’t look too good.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Editorial Board — which is composed of both greek and non-greek students — would, however, like to commend chapters that are actively trying to change the status quo in the greek community.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s our hope that one day these sorts of chapters will be the norm rather than the exception.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— opinion@idsnews.com\\r\\nFollow the Opinion Desk on Twitter @ids_opinion.',\n",

And you don’t have the legal grounds to sue for any of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nA broadcasting intern at Phoenix Satellite Television U.S. recently discovered she could not bring her sexual harassment claim to court under New York City Human Rights Law because she was not an “official” employee.\\r\\n\\r\\nWages are a matter of employment rights, but I would think assault or anything that made a person feel uncomfortable in his or her own skin would be subject to revision under human rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act does not cover unpaid interns, as the ruling stands, a judge told a woman she doesn’t make enough or matter enough to a company for the perversion of her body to be important.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of the accuracy of the intern’s allegations, this gap in the law should be addressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, companies can choose to confront case parties in dealings with unpaid interns, but ultimately, state and city laws will not force them to, including those of Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy their definition, companies have a mind for business rather than grace or compassion. This extends to denying the right for interns to earn wage for overtime hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut students hungry enough for résumé listings can overlook anything. If companies say jump, eager interns will ask how high.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so came into play the beautiful advent of work that would otherwise be paid for, all under the guise of a “learning opportunity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m not questioning whether this tricky trend of free labor for a C.V.-builder or networking gig is a fair trade. It’s part of the current job market that demands evidence of such “employment” history.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll I’m asking is the compensation include basic human rights like the right to question and persecute sexist or racist behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering interns are relying on company referrals for the slightest possibility of future employment, and the legal backing isn’t in place anyway, there is little incentive for those harassed or discriminated against to press charges.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, some universities force employers to adhere to an agreed harassment policy in order to list internship opportunities on their websites.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very least, courts should extend their own harassment policies — their Human Rights Acts — to protect unpaid interns.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— ashhendri@indiana.edu',\n",

Ettinger said one of the purposes of Take Back the Night was to reach out to victims of sexual assault and provide support.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that for the longest time it was something that people didn’t want to talk about, and now there is more public awareness and support for survivors,” said Ettinger.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent studies, Indiana ranks second in the nation, at 17.3 percent, in average number of girls raped between the ages of 9 and 12 according to a press release. The national average is 10.5 percent. \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the 2012 Annual Security Report for IU Bloomington, 50 cases of forced sexual offenses on campus were reported to IUPD in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuest speaker Stacy Weida, crisis interventions coordinator at Middle Way House, said the number isn’t necessarily representative of all of the victims.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There certainly are a number of survivors that choose not to report,” Weida said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeida said while women are the majority of sexual assault victims, they are more likely to seek help than male victims. In this year’s Annual Security Report for IU Bloomington, the only two IU programs listed for combatting sexual assault, Rape Aggression Defense and IUPD, teach self defense exclusively to women.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ultimately, it affects everyone,” said WSA Treasurer Meredith Moon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWSA’s event helped promote organizations that counsel victims of all genders.\\r\\n“We really want to show them there are people who care,” Ettinger said.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, colleges remain the most rampant sites for sexual assault, with female freshmen as the most affected group, Weida said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In particular it’s important to spread awareness on college campuses,” Weida said. “I have met with several IU students on campus already this semester.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMoon said she felt it was helpful for victims of sexual assault to share their experiences with others.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it really helps to put a face on the issues,” Moon said. “Sexual assault can cause a lot of problems with connecting to people.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWeida said one of the largest obstacles in battling sexual assault is society’s tendency to blame victims.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People say things like ‘she shouldn’t have been drinking’, or ‘she shouldn’t have worn that,’” Weida said. “A lot of girls drink, and a lot of girls wear tight skirts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said victim-blaming influences how victims deal with the grief afterward, often causing them to question themselves and feel guilty for being assaulted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even in the strong, educated women survivors that come to us, we almost always see the guilt,” Weida said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Weida and Ettinger said they believe sexual assault can be stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We can stop it by changing the way people think about sex, power, and their responsibility to each other,” Weida said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Sarah Zinn on Twitter @sarah_zinn.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Chances are if you were in spitting distance of a radio over the summer, you heard Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines,” a catchy R&B tune featuring T.I. and Pharrell Williams.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song immediately sparked a slew of controversy, justifiably when you consider the potentially misogynistic lyrical content and the overtly salacious music video.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you were at the IU football game against Mizzou this weekend, you heard the Marching Hundred play ”Blurred Lines.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn our neighboring state of Ohio, the Ohio University Marching 110 came under fire for practicing the same song.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the geographic proximity of the Steubenville High School rape case to OU, it’s understandable that they came under fire for practicing the arguably sexist and “rapey” song.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt didn’t help things when pop princess Miley Cyrus twerked on Thicke during his performance of “Blurred Lines” on this year’s VMAs, a routine that placed nearly all the controversy on Cyrus and not Thicke.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is a sexist problem that speaks to the hegemonic culture in America. “Blurred Lines,” as a song, does not.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the lines aren’t nearly as solidly rape-y as some bloggers and media critics suggest. Perhaps I’m overly optimistic, but my ears hear a groovy little song about sexual tension, not sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m not saying the song doesn’t have its problems in light of rape culture and sexism.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I’m definitely not here to wholly defend the music video, which features Thicke, T.I., and Williams fully dressed while female models strut around in various states of undress.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to me, a feminist supporter who believes in gender equality down the line, “Blurred Lines” is handing the power over to the ladies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThicke coos in the first verse, “Maybe I’m going deaf / maybe I’m going blind / maybe I’m out of my mind.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis describes a man under a woman’s spell, whether that was her intention or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the song, it appears the female in question holds the power in this sexual\\r\\ndynamic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThicke goes on to sing, “OK now he was close / tried to domesticate you / But you’re an animal / baby it’s in your nature.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is where the lines truly do get blurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems the lady in question may be involved in a relationship in which she is unable to be herself sexually.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blurred lines then become lines of morality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it okay for the lady to cheat with Thicke if he promises to liberate her?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis may not sound like an equal trade-off from sexism, but it still keeps the power in the woman’s hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThicke may be acting as a temptation, for which he may be rightly ridiculed as a douchebag.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he isn’t assaulting this woman. He’s just giving her the option.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, many of the song’s lyrics imply it’s up for the ladies to choose whether or not the sexual tension can proceed into the bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nT.I. raps, “So I just watch and wait for you to salute.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThicke sings, “Go ahead / get at me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the men putting it on the line that they want a certain lady, but the ball is in her court. They’re responding to mixed signals and letting her know where they stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe can choose whether or not she reciprocates the sexual sentiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s no lyric where Thicke, T.I., or Williams imply the female wasn’t giving consent and they were going for it anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Blurred Lines” is hardly blemish free from undercurrents of sexism, and the video was truly a missed opportunity to play with gender roles in society.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut give the guys a little credit here. They simply know what they want and hope the ladies feel the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— wdmcdona@indiana.edu\\r\\nFollow columnist Dane McDonald on Twitter @W_DaneMcDonald.',\n",

Or would you venture into an area like our campus where your prey have been disarmed for your convenience?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of sexual assaults on college campuses — including IU — are committed in seemingly safe locations like dorms, friend’s apartments or Greek houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to one study at IUPUI, approximately 92 percent of women who have been raped knew their attacker.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost perpetrators of sexual assault are not “dedicated to succeed in a mission of crime,” but are everyday people who would not consider their actions out of line — they simply “didn’t ask outright if s/he wanted it” or “made a no into a yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout two thirds of attempted or completed rapes are committed in the context of alcohol or drug use.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Mr. Haro’s suggestion were to be followed, we would empower people who are too intoxicated to consent to sex to protect themselves using a deadly weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s simply not a practical nor effective suggestion, Mr. Haro, and frankly reinforces the notion of blaming the victim. “If only you had defended yourself” is the last thing a survivor needs to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\nI applaud Mr. Haro’s concern for survivors of sexual assault, and I encourage him and fellow defenders of justice to volunteer with campus organizations such as RAISE (Raising Awareness of Interactions in Sexual Encounters) and the Sexual Assault Crisis Center if they want to make a true and lasting change.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most forms of violence, the biggest changes will be seen when we change the culture of acceptance of sexual assault, not when we increase the severity of punishment only for the most extreme examples — particularly when the extreme cases make up a tiny portion of the total problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n— lorenzt@indiana.edu',\n",

She died two weeks later at a hospital in Singapore.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the time that followed, six fast-track courts were set up to deal specifically with cases related to violence against women.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Delhi verdict was reached in nine months, compared to the four or five years it may have taken in regular court.\\r\\n\\r\\nPunishment for rapists increased to a life sentence in prison or the death penalty if the victim dies. The minimum sentence for gang rape increased to 20 years in prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crime these men committed was horrific and the woman’s family deserves justice, but it’s hard to see how this trial will help other victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn India, many victims are from low-income families or socially excluded groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost rape cases aren’t committed by strangers on a bus, but by acquaintances.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen who know their rapists are often forced to remain silent because of familial or societal pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose willing to come forward may face police harassment, humiliation or refusal to help them file a First Information Report. An FIR is necessary before police can investigate a case and begin the criminal justice process.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if the case does go to trial, the Business Standard reports a mere 25 to 35 percent conviction rate in rape cases, though this varies by state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average person can’t combat police corruption or improve the Indian court system.\\r\\n \\r\\nHowever, he or she can improve the way women are viewed and treated in his or her community.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that the publicity has died down, it’s time to address one of the root causes in most cases of rape and sexual assault — the low societal value placed on girls and women.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn’t an issue specific to India, either. One in five women in the U.S. will be sexually assaulted during her life, according to a survey conducted by the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Victim-blaming is as pervasive in America as it is in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nStricter sentencing for rapists won’t stop violence against girls and women in India or anywhere else in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeaching respect for women will.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— kmthacke@indiana.edu.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow columnist Kate Thacker on Twitter @katelynthacker.',\n",

The core components of the program include learning modules on alcohol, drug abuse and sexual assault, a comprehensive quiz and a follow-up on student knowledge and progress in October.\\r\\n“My student body provides a more holistic approach to student health,” said Jackie Daniels, director of the Office of Alternative Screening and Intervention Services. “It also appeared to me that it was more relevant in terms of videos and resources. We wanted to capture the broader student experience.”\\r\\nA major difference between My Student Body and AlcoholEdu is the sexual assault component. The program provides information specifically for college students, such as a definition of consent and information about bystander intervention. Daniels said the program fits with IU’s new Culture of Care initiative.\\r\\n“We want students to intervene in situations that might be risky for someone else’s health or their own,” Daniels said.\\r\\nThe program is being used at several universities nationwide, including Louisiana State University, University of San Diego and Tulane University. While My Student Body is a national program, it was chosen by OASIS because of its customizable options to fit the needs of IU students.\\r\\nAs part of My Student Body, OASIS was able to create the “MyPlan” landing page that offers students a number of resources like the Culture of Care initiative, contact information for the IU Health Center and the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Conduct.\\r\\nDaniels said the page is geared to give freshmen a plan for their entire first year at\\r\\ncollege.\\r\\n“Part of that plan is learning about resources on campus,” Daniels said.\\r\\nResults from the My Student Body are used by OASIS throughout the year to inform their prevention programming. Information on the course results will be available in October after students take the follow-up survey.\\r\\nFrom preliminary data, Daniels said she has already noted some surprising trends.\\r\\n“The data breaks down the stereotype that IU is a party school — that everyone drinks,” said Daniels. “It’s important to have that information to see the change from August to October and use that information to target areas and specific behaviors.”\\r\\nCurrently, the student response to My Student Body is overwhelmingly positive, Daniels said.\\r\\nOf 5,000 students who took the course, 92 percent say they are more aware of campus alcohol policies, 87 percent feel like they know how to take more precautions to maintain personal safety and 81 percent believe that overall, the course helped them make healthy adjustments to college.\\r\\n“I think it is necessary for students to take it,” said Erika Hudson, a freshman student who recently finished the course. “The issues are important because anything like such can occur on a college campus.”\\r\\nMoving forward, Daniels said she hopes My Student Body will have a positive effect on students’ decision-making on campus.\\r\\n“My biggest hope is that it plants a seed at the beginning — that IU cares about their health and well-being,” Daniels said. “I would like to think they see their academic life and personal development as very aligned with their health.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter\\r\\nRashmika Nedungadi on\\r\\nTwitter @rashmika_n.',\n",

For others the decision is made by the portrayals they have seen in the media.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd lastly, for many it is based on what they have seen on IU’s campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word “greek” unfortunately conjures images of red solo cups, alpha attitudes and an association with sexual assault for a lot of IU students.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let’s be clear. Greek life is much more than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor far too long the actions of a few have eclipsed the larger purpose of fraternities, which is to foster a sense of brotherhood, make members into better men and make a life-long commitment to something bigger than themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, we’ve seen a viral acceptance of the Total Frat Move mentality that’s more focused on an asinine philosophy of coded intolerance, the explicit objectification of women as nothing more than “slam pieces” and a pretty tactless emphasis on the assertion of status, as seen by the many guys on college campuses that look like they’re going yachting in their dad’s clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I digress.\\r\\n\\r\\nRipping greeks is too easy. What isn’t easy is making a case for why we need them at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt IU we’re lucky to have one of the largest and most active greek systems in the country. Each year we have chapters that raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for various philanthropies and devote countless hours to community service.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo many of our student leaders are greek, while also being involved in a lot of other areas on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, this is often the exception, when it should be the standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nYear by year oppositional voices argue the greek system is dangerous, it’s elitist, it gives IU a bad name.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of my freshman year, I was on that side of the fence. But last semester, I had the opportunity to meet some exceptional people who opened my mind to what a fraternity should and could be. And I haven’t looked back since.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs rush season is underway, many students will face the decision of what type of college experience they want to have, and, more importantly, what type of culture they want to create at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nI give them only one piece of advice: there’s a very stark difference between a frat and a fraternity. We have both at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich is which? That’s for you to decide.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust know being greek is a life-long commitment.\\r\\n\\r\\nChoose wisely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— edsalas@indiana.edu\\r\\nFollow columnist Eduardo Salas on Twitter @seibbe.',\n",

       "  'body': 'We all draw lines in terms of what we find morally and socially acceptable. These lines are often blurry until we encounter situations that clarify them.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I saw a recent news story about a group of students at Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, chanting an apparently pro-rape cheer, one of the lines I’d drawn for myself got a little clearer — the one called “rape culture.”  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn a video taken during Saint Mary’s “Frosh Week,” both male and female students are seen participating in a cheer that is pretty offensive, even if it weren’t in the context of a college orientation event.\\r\\n\\r\\n“SMU boys, we like them young. Y is for your sister. O is for oh-so-tight. U is for underage. N is for no consent. G is for grab that ass.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHuh.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think I see why 80 student leaders at that university have been assigned sensitivity training, two student organizers are facing disciplinary action and the president of the student union has decided to step down after a whopping one week on the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously, the chant was inappropriate, but let’s look on the bright side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least students had enough integrity to stop this stupid, insulting display before it became some kind of annual rape-condoning routine.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh wait, no they didn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis chant has reportedly been a tradition for five years. Think about that for a minute.\\r\\nSaint Mary’s students have been chanting “N is for no consent” since I was in middle school, and the only reason they’ve stopped is because somebody put a video of it on the Internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s not integrity — that’s complacency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis complacency is the problem, even more so than the chant. I don’t think the students in that video are rapists, even though the cheer clearly encourages sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my mind they’re just kids more concerned with defying the rules than the social ramifications of what they’re saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real problem exemplified by the Saint Mary’s video is not that students are rapists, it’s that sexual assault is considered — at least by some — to be an appropriate area in which to disagree with The Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me, this chant is just a way for students to rebel against authority, namely against the common message of “don’t rape.” These students are trying to express how free and rebellious and hedonistic they are more than they’re trying to advocate sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some ways this is good. We’re not dealing with a group of rapists here, espousing their warped dogma as they prepare to assault unassuming victims throughout the school year. Instead, we’re looking at ignorant, horny young people who are too dumb or too oblivious to realize how offensive they’re being.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual-assault-encouragement should not be a tool to rebel against authority. It should be put on the “grossly inappropriate” shelf alongside racism, sexism, homophobia and religious intolerance.\\r\\n\\r\\nFind another way to rebel. Find another way to celebrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is where I draw my line on rape culture. Where you draw yours is up to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— kkusisto@indiana.edu',\n",

It seeks to alter and violate the principles of the Constitution that, to this day, shields us all from government tyranny.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should have the right to defend ourselves under the proper provision of a concealed carry license wherever we go, even on IU campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur national media loves magnifying numerous incidents of armed violence and demonizing guns non-stop, so I am not surprised to find IU is opposed to allowing licensed concealed firearms on campus. This opposition is primarily fear-based.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough gun sales have increased in the past 20 years in America, the National Shooting Sports Foundation statistics illustrate that homicides committed with guns have dropped 39 percent, while other gun-related crimes have dropped 69 percent. The 2007 to 2011 FBI homicide data table supports this claim by showing a steady decline in gun murders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blog site Foxandhoundsdaily.com holds that about 200,000 women in the U.S. avoid becoming victims of sexual assault every year by defending themselves with guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IU campus has had its unfortunate share of sexual assaults and robberies throughout the past two semesters.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am absolutely convinced some of these unfortunate experiences might have been prevented if concealed carry was welcomed on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll it takes is common sense to agree with my last remark.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you were a thief or a sexual predator dedicated to succeed in your mission of crime, would you prefer to hunt in a location where anybody might be packing heat? Or would you venture into an area like our campus where your prey have been disarmed for your convenience?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith only one exception, every mass shooting in the United States since 1950 has occurred in areas where citizens were barred from carrying firearms.\\r\\n\\r\\nGun bans only apply to law-abiding citizens, thus making their fundamental purpose of stopping and preventing rampant criminal activity totally vain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf numerous cities across America allow concealed carry, then why shouldn’t we be able to implement it at our campus where the majority of the carriers would be intelligent, responsible students and staff?\\r\\n\\r\\nSure, one can bring up the terrifying combination of guns and alcohol on or near campus, but should we all relinquish our human right to defense just because a minority of fools can’t be trusted? Only a microscopic number of concealed carriers commit crimes with their permitted weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nBottom line: I would feel more secure keeping my Second Amendment right and knowing that I or a fellow student could respond in a life-or-death emergency rather than turtling up and waiting for the police.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever we submit to fear, we are only empowering the source from which that fear arises.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— edharo@indiana.edu\\r\\nFollow columnist Edgar Haro @EdHaroDude.',\n",

And I’m okay with that.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow it never occurred to me that at any college, students may be carrying concealed weapons on them. It just sounds to me, put simply, really dumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand why students would want to carry a concealed weapon. After incidents like the Virginia Tech and University of Texas massacres, there’s always an underlying fear that one of your classmates may emotionally explode and take it out on his psychology lecture class.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there are more personal fears for us IU students. For females in particular, there’s the fact that about one in four college women is a victim of attempted or completed sexual assault. Those rates are high enough to make anyone want a weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are the muggings, like the one that happened in the Eigenmann Hall parking lot last fall semester. A gun probably could have helped that poor guy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe many posters of Lauren Spierer’s face remind us that no matter who we’re with or how close we are to home, we’re not invincible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are so many reasons to allow concealed weapons on campus that I’m almost talking myself into supporting the idea. Almost.\\r\\n\\r\\nState Sen. Jim Banks fully supports students having the right to carry a concealed weapon. He has proposed a bill that would make it illegal for universities to ban guns on campus. He recognizes college students are responsible adults and have the right to protect themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIU has opposed the bill. Mark Land, an IU spokesman, said the University is opposed because it is best the University decides its own gun policies regarding students and employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concern in allowing this bill is students would abuse the right. Instead of deterring crime, the approval of concealed weapons could cause more — by accident, if not on purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example Land provided was the fatal accident at Purdue in 2009, in which a pair of students jokingly aimed a gun at another student and it fired.\\r\\n\\r\\nI agree with Land. I think students having guns would result in more injuries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom line is that I don’t trust you guys. No offense. I barely trust my best friend with her pepper spray.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no way I can comfortably walk around campus knowing some of you have guns under your jackets, even if you do have a permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf IU students really feel that unsafe, maybe the University should stop building gaudy new dining halls and hire more security.

       "  'body': 'We won’t talk you out of drinking on a Friday night. No one else will, either. College is about making decisions for yourself. We just want you to be safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are a few things you should know if you do choose to attend that first big kegger.\\r\\nYou probably think it would never happen to you, but drinking can be dangerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to 2010 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 25,692 alcohol-induced deaths, some of which occurred on this campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who are new to drinking typically have low tolerances for alcohol, so don’t overdo it. When you drink too much and pass out, your gag reflexes (which prevent choking) and your breathing can be suppressed. People who have drunk enough to pass out are at risk of choking to death on their own vomit or suffering from alcohol poisoning, which results in emergency room visits or sometimes, death.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s important to know that if you see a friend who is showing signs or symptoms of alcohol poisoning, don’t hesitate to call 911. You won’t get in trouble for saving someone’s life.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RISK\\r\\nAnother issue that can come with college parties is sexual assault. As many as one in four college women experience unwanted sexual intercourse in the United States, and many of these incidents happen at or after parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe danger comes from a difference in expectations between men and women, said Elizabeth Armstrong, an assistant professor of sociology, in a 2006 press release. The majority of sexual assaults involve alcohol. Here are some tips to help you out:\\r\\n\\r\\nWatch for people who pressure you to drink or seem overly enthusiastic about getting you drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe careful with mixed punches or “Jungle Juice.” Their alcohol — or drug — content is often a mystery.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t leave your drink unattended.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever leave a friend alone when they have had too much to drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nMake arrangements with friends to stick together and agree on when to intervene if things look like they’re getting out of hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nStay in a public place, like the dance floor or seating area, and stay out of private rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnow where you are and how to get home. Always have cash for a cab and don’t rely on someone you don’t know to give you a ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrust your instincts. If you think someone is a creep, that person is most likely a creep.\\r\\n\\r\\nDID YOU KNOW...\\r\\nThe IU Health Center has a Sexual Assault Crisis Service (SACS)? This service offers crisis intervention, individual and group counseling and educational programming. It is available for any member of the IU community for free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe service has a 24-hour telephone line, which will put you in touch with a specially trained counselor who can answer your questions and further assist you. The phone number is 812-855-8900. If you are in immediate danger, don’t hesitate to call 911.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Around 8:11 p.m. on Monday, May 13, Bloomington police responded to a call from a woman alleging she had been confined in a vehicle where a man battered and attempted to rape her, BPD Sgt. Joe Crider said.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon arriving to the intersection of First and Walker streets, officers met a 28-year-old female saying she was victimized. She reported that she had been walking in the area when she was approached by a Hispanic man, driving a silver Chevy Malibu, and asked if she needed a ride. She stated that she declined and as she attempted to walk away, the man exited his vehicle and forced her inside it, Crider said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman reported to the police officers that she tried to get out of the vehicle, but that the man forcibly confined her inside of it as he battered and attempted to rape her, police said the woman said. She also allegedly stated that she tried to call 911, but that the man threw her phone out one of the car’s windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman then stated that the man drove the car to an empty parking lot area near First and Walker streets. Upon their arrival, she stated that she got into an altercation with the man and was able to exit the vehicle. The victim stated that the male suspect pursued her, knocking her to the ground, but then retreated back to his vehicle and drove off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victim provided a description of the vehicle, the license plate number and a description of the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly before 10 p.m. Monday, the Monroe County Sheriff’s Department located the vehicle at a local residence. A search warrant was obtained and the suspect was located.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile being interviewed, the male suspect stated that he had been searching for local escort services earlier in the night when he came across “Sexy Independent Escort Sparkles.” He said he made contact with one of the escorts there and arranged a meeting in the 700 block of South Walker Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe suspect reported that the escort sent him a photograph of her during text message conversations and agreed to a dollar amount for services she would provide. The police officers were given consent by the suspect to search through his cell phone where they obtained the photograph of the alleged escort and her address.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photograph and the address sent via text message indicated that the victim appeared to be the woman in this case, police said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male suspect stated that he met the woman, and that she voluntarily got into his vehicle, police said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male suspect also said the alleged female victim began “freaking out” and uttering racial slurs at him, police said. The female victim then indicated to the suspect that she was a police officer and began reaching for her phone. The male suspect admitted to throwing the phone out the window, but that he later steered the car into a parking lot and got out of his vehicle to help her recover it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the woman allegedly got on her cell phone, the male suspect reportedly saw an individual on a motorcycle nearby also using a cell phone, at which time the suspect thought he had been set up for a robbery, police said. The male suspect said he attempted to return to his vehicle when the woman allegedly held onto him and began to batter him, police said he said. The male suspect left soon after and returned to his home, police said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male suspect’s story was confirmed through the text message conversation he had on his cell phone prior to meeting. He also stated that he never touched the alleged female escort, police said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman was interviewed by police again and after being confronted with inconsistencies that were obtained through the suspect’s cell phone, the female suspect admitted that she was an escort, police said. Police also stated that she admitted to arranging a meeting with the suspect to exchange money for sexual favors, but the specific services and amount of money were not disclosed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female suspect admitted to making up the original story and falsely reporting confinement, battery and attempted sexual assault, police said. She claimed she made up the story because she thought the operator of the vehicle was intoxicated, police said. The alleged female escort confirmed that the suspect did not touch her, police said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female suspect was subsequently arrested and preliminarily charged with impersonating a police officer, attempt of criminal confinement, false reporting and prostitution. The female suspect was jailed and the male suspect was released.\\r\\nNo money or sexual favors were exchanged, police said.\\r\\n\\r\\n—Samantha Felix',\n",

       "  'body': 'It was the day after Thanksgiving break when freshman Mason Reiter and the rest of his Zeta Beta Tau pledge class received news of the sexual assault allegation.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Nov. 5, 2012, then-ZBT President Kyle Mataloni received a letter from the Student Organization Ethics Board, which oversees disciplinary hearings involving allegations, criminal or otherwise, involving a student organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter placed the fraternity on deferred suspension for more than a year and informed Mataloni that students on the board had found ZBT members responsible for “sexual assault” and “sexual contact with another person without consent,” according to the letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepresentatives from Student Life and Learning did not respond to requests for further information about the findings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four-page letter outlined sanctions and requirements the fraternity had to meet in order to remain an active chapter on campus, including completion of a series of sexual assault awareness educational programs led by IU Health Center and Student Life and Learning.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on the day after Thanksgiving break, two members of the fraternity’s national organization drove from their headquarters in Indianapolis to meet with the pledges.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the meeting, Reiter and his fellow pledges learned they would no longer be initiates of the fraternity they initially wanted to join. Unbeknownst to the new recruits, representatives from nationals and the University had been meeting with members of ZBT’s then-executive board discussing the consequences of possible criminal activity in the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a house and without upperclassmen members, nationals approached the pledge class with a proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We were just completely cut off from everything until nationals finally came to us and said, ‘They’re all gone. Do you guys want to step in?’” Reiter, now the president of what he and his executive board call the “new ZBT,” said. “We said yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current chapter of ZBT, National ZBT Director Laurence Bolotin said, has no relationship with the former chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nZBT crewneck sweatshirts began reappearing on campus in early April, when members of the “new ZBT” started one of their two philanthropy projects for the remainder of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of freshmen rolled an eight-foot-tall beach ball around campus, soliciting students to sign it. For every signature, $2 would be donated to Hoosier Hills Food Bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nMid-signature, some students would ask, “Didn’t you guys get kicked off campus?”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nZeta Beta Tau’s disciplinary problems began in April 2010 when a woman was transported to the hospital after consuming alcohol at a fraternity function.\\r\\n\\r\\nCitations for “uncontrolled distribution of hard liquor” and “drinking games” followed, according to University documents, and the fraternity went through periods of disciplinary probation and social restrictions through 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in September, allegations of sexual assault surfaced. Police went to the fraternity’s house on the North Jordan extension and seized security footage, sophomore and former ZBT Vice President Chad Silver said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to IU Police Department records, a forcible sex offense was reported at ZBT’s house Sept. 10, 2011. The case did not end in arrest. No charges were filed. IU’s Assistant General Counsel Stephen Harper declined the release of further information about the report.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an email from December 2012, Assistant Director for Fraternity and Sorority Life Michael Goodman told the IDS that ZBT was “found responsible for disorderly conduct, actions that endanger the community, harassment and alcohol violations, among several others.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time, Bolotin refused to comment on the exact nature of the offenses that contributed to the fraternity’s suspension.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early December, Mike Shartiag, ZBT alumnus and owner of the fraternity’s former house at 1640 N. Jordan Ave., announced he would not allow ZBT to occupy the house for the 2013-14 academic year. The letters were removed from the fraternity’s home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a December interview, Shartiag said repeated violations of the building’s fire code — mattresses propped against walls and general mistreatment of the property — caused him to not renew the lease.\\r\\n\\r\\nShartiag witnessed a former ZBT house burn in a 1984 fire that was ultimately deemed arson. The fire caused the death of a 19-year-old and the hospitalization of four fraternity members who suffered second-degree burns and injuries from leaping from the burning fraternity house. Thirty other individuals were also treated, according to a report from the Associated Press.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I find it incomprehensible that today’s ZBT could repeatedly commit such egregious life safety violations,” Shartiag said in a press release issued in early December. “The single deciding factor on the part of the ‘Landlord’ in not renewing ZBT’s lease was the life safety contractual violations with respect to the fire alarm system and fire code violations in the leased property.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Oct. 29, 2012, IU’s Office of Insurance, Loss Control and Claims conducted an inspection of 1640 N. Jordan Ave. based on the number of runs Bloomington Fire Department was making to the house. The fire alarm was working as designed, and the arrangement of smoke detectors surpassed the requirements set by the office’s codes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the times the fire department responded unnecessarily, such as when occupants smoked in the individual rooms, action was taken against individual fraternity members, according to a report written by Assistant Director of the Office of Insurance, Loss Control and Claims Mel Lane.\\r\\n\\r\\nShartiag did not respond to multiple email inquiries about the sexual assault allegations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout November and December of 2012, the national fraternity and the University worked with the fraternity’s executive board to find solutions to the allegations. The national chapter conducted a review of all members.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe investigation of any criminal allegations against fraternity members was left to law enforcement, Bolotin said April 17.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Zeta Beta Tau applies a much higher standard of conduct to its members,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccordingly, the national fraternity conducted an investigation not because of suspected illegal activity, but because it was suspected that members fell below standards expected by the fraternity, Bolotin said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy spring semester 2013, the national fraternity had expelled members of ZBT, Bolotin said. Some were given the opportunity to reapply for membership. Those who declined became early alumni of the fraternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early December, Mataloni told the IDS that members of the fraternity were upset with national headquarters and decided to disaffiliate on their own accord.\\r\\n\\r\\nMataloni did not respond to numerous requests for further comment.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Office of Student Ethics Director and Associate Dean of Students Jason Casares could not discuss ZBT’s case specifically, he said the Office of Student Ethics is the point of entry into all allegations, criminal or otherwise, which might require disciplinary action on the part of the University.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the case for sexual assault allegations against ZBT.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an incident of sexual violence is reported to IUPD, the Office of Student Ethics is notified and reaches out to the victim, requesting to meet. The initial meeting involves the victim, a representative from the Office of Student Ethics and a third-party student advocate going over different resources available on campus. During this time, the victim will also learn about the Office of Student Ethics’ capacity to investigate the incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasares said reports of sexual violence account for “an extreme minority of cases that we have.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether or not the Office of Student Ethics enters into an investigation is at the discretion of the victim, Casares said, unless it is determined there is a larger campus safety concern at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Board of Student Ethics determined the incidents at ZBT were organizational — the problem transcended individual members and was associated with the fraternity at large — and the case moved to Student Life and Learning to be heard by the Student Organization Ethics Board.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Student Organization Ethics Board, Casares said, consists of IU students who review details of investigations conducted by the Office of Student Ethics and make decisions about the group based on the findings.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the fraternity’s loss of housing, rumors circulated about the future of the fraternity, of possible rapes and even the presence of a “rape room” within the fraternity’s former house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Those rumors are false,” Bolotin said. “In fact, they are ridiculous.”\\r\\n\\r\\nZBT is still recognized as an active chapter by the University. It consists of 24 members, all of them freshman. Left without a house, they meet in Briscoe Quad, where the majority of the fraternity’s members live.\\r\\n\\r\\nZBT is the only fraternity on campus with an all-freshman executive board, and they are working to completely change the image of the group after the “sexual assault scandal,” as one member of the executive board called it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral months ago, ZBT announced it would partner with sorority Sigma Delta Tau and Jewish Women’s International to develop a program to help members understand “the foundation of safe, healthy and mutually respectful interpersonal relationships,” Bolotin said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We know that our image isn’t going to change over night,” Reiter said. “Ideally, we’d love it to because we’re a new group of kids who aren’t associated with what the old ZBT image is known for.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Last week, two of my fellow columnists ran stories with similar themes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSam Ostrowski wrote about a singular incident in which a Kilroy’s bouncer verbally assaulted him with a homophobic slur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reaction was huge and rightfully so. Sam’s column was poignant, well-written and tackled an issue that needs to be addressed in our community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very next day, a piece appeared by columnist Emma Wenninger in which she recalled an entire week full of excessive verbal attacks and slut-shaming merely for being a woman on campus. The reaction to her column was not so huge.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing harassed is not a competition, but for what reason would our community react so differently to these two incidents, or, in Emma’s case, multiple incidents?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy was Sam’s writing a call to action, while Emma’s was business as usual?\\r\\n\\r\\nEven Emma herself wrote, “We’re all trying to enjoy ourselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one wants to talk about women being harassed anymore. We’re good people. We were just trying to have fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd while Sam’s was not the first column to ever point out casual, juvenile harassment, neither was Emma’s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, it seems like we encounter issues surrounding homophobic, racist and misogynist speech on our campus with such frequency that some weeks, our editors ask us not to write about them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the way words like “slut” are thrown around in this community doesn’t have the least bit to do with slut-shaming or sexual promiscuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has to do with cars full of immature, disgusting little boys, circle-jerking for who wants to be the loudest, the crudest and the funniest, screaming slurs at anyone they see who dares to walk anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nA friend of mine couldn’t walk home from class this last week without being rated by two strangers drinking outside. Yes, they had cards with numbers on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI prefer to bike around Bloomington because it is easier to cope with harassment from people who hate cyclists than from people who just hate women.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople who hate both tend to be less vocal, as coming up with one insult that targets two things can be a little tricky.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy favorite was when someone shouted to me, “Are you Lance Armstong’s daughter?” My least favorite was when I was told, “Ride that bike like a dick.” Neither make a lot of sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, with all of that being said, everyone is tired of reading about women getting called “slut” and women who are afraid to walk home alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re all tired of seeing peeling posters of Lauren Spierer’s fading visage all over the town. We’re tired of hearing strikers interrupt our classes, asking us to care. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re tired of being told we’re being cheated by our administration and that our classes are a waste of time and money.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’re tired of being told that we can be better.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, I’m tired of being called a “slut” for walking down the street and a “bitch” for speaking my mind, while my fellow students who have openly ridiculed the homeless are defended as “sweet girls.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m tired of being told I’m overreacting for wanting to see change in the situations that most closely affect myself and my peers, the situations in which I have the most control and influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I am full-to-the-brim, furiously, exhaustingly fed up with letting my peers think they are allowed to behave like cruel, insolent, disrespectful jerks and get away with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can bike to Uganda all damn week, but we won’t give the time of day to those who share our community, or, perhaps more accurately, upon whose community we impose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs much as I am ashamed of my school this week, I am also deeply proud.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor every batch of students who couldn’t care less, there is a small pocket of people who are hurting enough to fight back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been a dark few weeks for us, Indiana, but I know we can do better.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the truly kind and compassionate people I’ve met in the four years I’ve spent here, I know we are better.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood luck with your next four years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— alliston@indiana.edu',\n",

The Monroe County Zietlow Justice Building was named after her in honor of her work.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe committee was set up to study the current state of the community’s response to domestic violence, Zietlow said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe domestic violence case load has been consistent with about 200 cases per year in Monroe Country for the last several years, Monroe County Prosecuting Attorney Chris Gaal said.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaal initiated the committee, sending out invitations to key stakeholders to participate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The committee was formed to explore additional ways to improve services and implement the best practices regarding domestic violence in the community,” Gaal said in an email. “Our hope is that the committee will gather information and then evaluate the current community response to domestic violence, identify any potential areas for improvement and make the recommendations for any additional resources or public education and prevention efforts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMonroe County already has a Domestic Violence Task Force which meets regularly, Zietlow said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the new committee is designed for more in-depth research and bring a variety of perspectives together to address domestic violence, Zietlow said.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaal said about 20 community stakeholders have been invited to participate.\\r\\nZietlow and Gaal worked to come up with a broad list of key stakeholders, representing various sectors of the community involved in the local response to domestic violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nStakeholders include representatives from law enforcement, the justice system, the healthcare sector, victim advocates, relevant government agencies and commissions and other service providers, Gaal said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeetings first convened in December and have included presentations by representatives from Middle Way House, local Department of Child Services representatives, a sexual assault nurse examiner, a retired social worker from IU Health Bloomington Hospital, Southern Indiana Pediatrics and Court Appointed Special Advocates, according to a news release.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are a large spectrum of people (who) because of the nature of domestic violence, don’t seek help,” Zietlow said. “We want to be part of the effort as a community to help reach out to people, not necessarily just through the law, so they don’t have to suffer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prosecutor’s office has sought continuous improvements in the handling of domestic violence cases in Monroe County since 2007, Gaal said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office publicly releases detailed monthly data on all domestic violence cases handled by the office. Additionally, since 2008, the prosecutor’s office has assigned a full-time victim assistant to work exclusively with victims of domestic violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creation of the domestic violence study committee is an added action of these overall initiatives from the prosecutor’s office.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have never asked what happens to the survivors and what happens to the victims,” Zietlow said. “We have to keep talking about this, and we have never taken this sort of in-depth look at domestic violence in our community.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Student leaders from some of IU’s largest, most prominent organizations engaged in a public dialogue on topics including campus safety, rising tuition and minority representation at a town hall discussion Friday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe town hall was organized by Union Board and included leaders from nine organizations. Matthew Glowicki, Indiana Daily Student managing editor, moderated the discussion, largely dominated by IU Student Association President Kyle Straub.\\r\\n\\r\\nStraub pointed out that IUSA started the Culture of Care Week last spring to raise awareness of sexual assault, mental health and drug abuse and to further the goal of campus safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a responsibility of campus leaders to promote a culture of care and modification of behavior on these issues,” Straub said. “It’s really about changing the culture.”\\r\\n\\r\\nInterfraternity Council recently started Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault to raise awareness of and combat sexual assault. The Residence Halls Association has promoted a similar initiative aimed at sexual assault awareness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have been focused on addressing what is consent, how to give consent and how to respect the boundaries of consent,” RHA Vice President of Student Affairs Hana Horton said. “In discussions with students we have found that some feel that once you give consent, you can’t take it back. There has to be more one-on-one education.”\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Kauffman, president of the Board of Aeons, which advises IU President Michael McRobbie, said the board has suggested a shift in policy toward reducing tuition for students set to graduate on-time. He said this could boost graduation rates.\\r\\n\\r\\nStraub revealed IUSA has regular meetings with IU’s chief financial officer to discuss tuition transparency.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is unfortunately no systematic way for the student to demand tuition rates from rising,” Straub said. “However, we want to make sure students fully understand the big picture: What makes up tuition? What does tuition pay for?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding minority representation, each organization leader said diversity is not as well represented on IU’s campus as it could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whose responsibility is it to consider minority representation?” Horton said. “It is all of our jobs to always be addressing minority representation, not giving this task to just one committee.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJose Delgado, member of the Multicultural Greek Council, said the organization plans to be more proactive on the issue of minority representation in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On a campus with 43,000, I would pay someone a lot of money to tell me how to reach each and every single student,” Straub said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Pan-Hellenic Council member, Samuel Owusu-Mireku said the organization started an event called Dorm Storming, focused on spreading the word about the organization and its various events in campus dorms once a month.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We honestly don’t feel welcome sometimes,” Owusu-Mireku said. “African-American students come to places like the NPHC and the Black Culture Center for a place to feel at home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaders also addressed questions from an audience member involved with IU on Strike about the relevance and validity of student organizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an impromptu poll the audience member conducted, most attendees said they were involved with one of the organizations represented. The student called into question the purpose and success of meetings such as this, given the low student turnout. \\r\\n\\r\\n“It has to be a two-way road,” Straub said. “We need to be met halfway. We genuinely try to make sure we are representing every student’s voice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion Board President Jared Thomas suggested that in order for future meetings of this nature to be successful, effective advertising must be targeted at students. He suggested that scheduling the meeting on a more convenient date and time would potentially influence more students to show up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it’s important if you as an individual student, have a concern, to get involved with an organization or a student group,” Thomas said. “You will become part of the larger group with a voice. The best way to effect change is to get involved.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The IU Student Association election is Tuesday and Wednesday, and we implore you to vote. Voice your concerns and make your voice heard through your ballot.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter last year’s controversial unopposed election, it’s important for students to make it clear their opinions matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Board had a chance to interview YOUniversity, Hoosiers 4 Solutions and SPARC for IU on March 22.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hearing from all three groups, The Board has chosen to endorse Hoosiers 4 Solutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the parties vying to run IUSA, Hoosiers 4 Solutions is the most in touch with student needs and realistic about their initiatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe executive team can represent a wide variety of interests and groups at IU. Here’s why we support them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNO SALARIES\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current administration allocated some of the budget into $3,000 salaries for executives.\\r\\n\\r\\nYOUniversity, made up in part of people associated with the current administration, is the only ticket in the race that plans to take salaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoosiers 4 Solutions and SPARC have pledged not to take executive salaries if elected, instead choosing to put that money back into the funding of initiatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidential candidate Casey Shelburne said he pays for school himself and understands the need for a job. However, instead of choosing to pay himself, he will begin work as a part-time officer with the IU Police Department come August. We call that dedication.\\r\\n\\r\\nREALISTIC EXPANSION TO CULTURE OF CARE\\r\\n\\r\\nHoosiers 4 Solutions has the most sensible plan for continuing work with this initiative. One of their notable initiatives is to expand the Lifeline Law to include incidents of sexual assault. Underage victims who were sexually assaulted while drinking can still technically be charged with underage drinking in the course of reporting their assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause many sexual assaults happen while either the victim or perpetrator is under the influence of alcohol, this is an important improvement on the current law.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Hoosiers 4 Solutions and YOUniversity made the excellent point that the need to pregame and binge drink before tailgates can contribute to student alcohol abuse. However, Hoosiers 4 Solutions’ plan to sell beer and wine at games does more to encourage positive expression of school spirit. Serving beer and wine in the stadium will encourage more people to actually attend games and will help alleviate the need to drink dangerously beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nUNASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT OR PAST IUSA ADMINISTRATIONS\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps they said it best themselves. During our interview, when asked about their lack of experience with previous IUSA administrations, vice president for administration candidate Kelsey Gorman quipped that the “years of experience on other tickets haven’t necessarily amounted to much.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe agree. Students don’t always feel represented or well served by current and past projects, save a few. We think the unaffiliated nature of Hoosiers 4 Solutions could bring a freshness, lack of bias and practical perspective those associated with past administrations might lack.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTATE-LEVEL CONNECTIONS\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were impressed Hoosiers 4 Solutions has already begun lobbying for many proposed initiatives in state government. Shelburne has already leveraged the contacts he’s made from working for the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Secretary of State to begin talking about his ticket’s initiatives. Although local work and campus connections are important, to get big laws passed and large changes made, it’s necessary to work at the state level. Hoosiers 4 Solutions has already begun this work, and they’re not even elected yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nCONCRETE PLANS FOR CONTROLLING COLLEGE COSTS\\r\\n\\r\\nControlling college costs is one of the most important issues any ticket must address. Hoosiers 4 Solutions expressed the motivation to advocate for students with the Board of Trustees and the state government. Additionally, they already have plans to reduce both textbook and tuition costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey’ve proposed textbook transparency — professors would have to reveal average estimated textbook costs alongside other class information on OneStart.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, they’ve proposed implementing ways to restructure degree programs and semester lengths to help some students earn degrees in three years. Hoosiers 4 Solutions has expressed interest in working with the IU administration to make these academic changes, which have already been implemented at many other Indiana schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nFAIR REPRESENTATION\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team has members from The Kelley School of Business and multiple programs within the College of Arts and Sciences. The executive candidates have been involved throughout campus, including in Residence Halls Association, Hutton Honors College, the greek community, multiple academic and ethical fairness committees and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Equality.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoosiers 4 Solutions is a truly varied group. It has strong, practical leadership experience. The candidates can understand the priorities and problems of a wide variety of students here at IU. Out of all of the tickets, we think they best represent us — all of us.',\n",

       "  'body': 'VALPARAISO — None of Dustin McCowan’s DNA was found on the body of his murdered ex-girlfriend, Amanda Bach. None of his fingerprints were discovered inside her abandoned car or at the railroad tracks where body was dumped. The gun that was used to shoot her in the neck was never recovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite a lack of any physical evidence definitively placing him at the murder scene, McCowan, a 20-year-old from Union Township, was sentenced Thursday to 60 years in prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast month, a jury unanimously found McCowan guilty of first-degree murder. He was arrested for that crime on the IU campus after Bach’s body was found near train tracks almost 300 yards from McCowan’s home. One eyewitness testified that he had seen McCowan the night of the murder near where Bach’s body was found. A cellmate also testified that McCowan made incriminating comments in jail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Thursday’s sentencing, the emotions burst inside the courtroom. The victim’s family hurled insults at McCowan and his family, calling the defendant a “coward” and a “sociopath.” Family members stormed out of the room in anger, causing Porter County Superior Court Judge Bill Alexa to silence the room twice to restore order.\\r\\n\\r\\nBach’s mother glared at McCowan and his father as she snarled at them, mocking the convicted man. A prosecuting attorney called the McCowan family “pathetic.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most of the hearing, McCowan kept his head down. When asked by Judge Alexa if he had anything to say, the defendant mumbled under his breath. The judge asked him to speak up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” McCowan said. “I don’t think the court deserves it, your honor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nThe emotional sentencing was the latest episode in a case that has stunned\\r\\nNorthwest Indiana since Bach’s body was discovered last September.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening, the 19-year-old woman had been at McCowan’s home watching movies and playing Playstation 3. McCowan told detectives his ex-girlfriend left at about 1:30 a.m.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt 3:23 a.m., her 2006 Pontiac was found in the parking lot of a nearby convenience store. The driver’s seat had been pushed back to accommodate “a guy or larger person,” according to court documents. Bach was petite: She stood at five feet, two inches tall and weighed only 105 pounds. McCowan is six-foot two and 175 pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being interviewed by police about his missing ex-girlfriend, McCowan drove to Bloomington the next day to go to an IU football game with friends. He said he’d take a shot of alcohol in her honor, according to court documents.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate the next afternoon, her body was found 294 yards from McCowan’s house.\\r\\nShe was lying on her back, stripped down to her underwear. Her left leg curled awkwardly behind her. The right leg was flat but bent, with the knee splayed out. Five shirts and a bra were wrapped around her right hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice reported that there was no evidence of a sexual assault. Bach’s cellphone was never found.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCowan’s father, a Crown Point, Ind., police officer, told police he owns a 38-caliber handgun, but it was missing from his home. A similar gun was used to kill Bach, prosecutors say. At the time of the murder, McCowan was living with his parents.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the trial, a neighbor of the McCowan family testified that on the night Bach went missing, she heard a man say “Amanda get up, come on, Amanda, get up, Amanda, get up.” Court documents say she also heard a female voice say, “I can’t believe this is happening.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of McCowan’s cellmates testified that McCowan had bragged about killing a girl named “Amanda” and burying the gun “so good nobody would ever find it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorter County police have said they will begin investigating McCowan’s father, Joseph McCowan for helping his son cover up the crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the trial, one eyewitness testified that he saw McCowan while driving by the train tracks that night.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral of McCowan’s friends testified that they had heard him threatening Bach in the weeks before the murder. They told the jury that McCowan thought that Bach was pregnant, saying to a friend that if that was true, “I’m gonna have to kill her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nDeputy Prosecutor Cheryl Polarek argued for the maximum sentence of 65 years. Wearing a pink bracelet on her left hand — pink was Bach’s favorite color — the prosecutor talked about how Bach was well-liked and known for her friendly smile and memorable laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\nPink ties, pink scarves, pink shirts, pink ribbons, pink bracelets dotted the prosecutor’s side of the courtroom. Photos of Amanda in a pink top rested on the railing behind the prosecution’s table.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe McCowan family filled the side of the courtroom behind the defense. Joseph McCowan, currently under investigation on suspicion of helping cover up Bach’s murder, sat in the front row closest to the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prosecutor turned her attention to McCowan’s family.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dustin McCowan is the way he is because of the adults in his life,” she said. “They are dishonest, cowardly and pathetic.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this, someone on the McCowan side of the courtroom scoffed and stood up, storming toward the center aisle. Sheriff’s deputies blocked the Bach side of the courtroom and allowed the woman to exit the courtroom in frustration.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge Alexa stopped Polarek and pointed a finger at the McCowans. He threatened them with five days in jail for contempt if there was another outburst from that side of the courtroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not want to see anything like that again,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prosecutor continued, saying McCowan had a history of substance abuse, including drinking starting at age 16 and smoking marijuana occasionally starting at age 16 or 17. McCowan was known for having parties with alcohol when his parents were not at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witnesses testified that they took the trash,” she said, “and threw it by the railroad tracks near where Amanda’s body was found.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen defense attorney John Vouga stood to speak, he argued not only for the minimum sentence, but also defended the McCowan family.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not going to stoop to levels of name calling. I’m not going to do that,” he said. “Just as the prosecution are getting to know the Bach family, we’ve gotten to know the McCowan family.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the trial, Vouga had insisted that McGowan was innocent, and during the sentencing hearing, Vouga called it a “strictly circumstantial case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“After 25 years, I’ve had so many jury trials I can’t even count,” Vouga said after the hearing. “In a trial when there is absolutely no DNA evidence, no trace fiber evidence, no fingerprint evidence, nine out of 10 times an unbiased jury will find him not guilty.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen William Bach, Amanda’s father, took the witness stand to read a letter to the court, his hands were shaking. He had brought a photo of Amanda in a plastic frame to the stand with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because of Dustin McCowan’s cowardly actions, I will not see many milestones with my daughter Amanda,” he said. “Now I will not be able to walk her down the aisle.”\\r\\nMcCowan was looking down, clenching and unclenching his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s devastating to take one less plate out for dinner and see the place where she would have sat,” William Bach said. “I pray that one day he’ll tell the truth and beg forgiveness, but it takes a man to do that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSandy Bach, Amanda’s mother, demanded that McCowan look up and pay attention as she spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not let you get the best of me, Dustin McCowan, I will not,” she said. “Oh, you can’t even look at me, can you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she described her daughter, she broke into tears. The judge stopped her, asking if she would like someone else to read the letter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” she said. “I have to do this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe continued, her hands shaking lightly as she read about how Amanda always enjoyed helping people. She wanted to be a nurse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But because of the way she left this world, even that was taken from her,” Sandy Bach said. “I will not let you get the best of me, Dustin McCowan, I will not. You don’t like hearing that, do you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe called him a “selfish...sociopath of a man” and an “arrogant, idiotic young punk.” Once, she let slip, “Dustin McCoward.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe began to attack other members of the McCowan family, when Judge Alexa made her stop. The purpose of a victim impact statement, he said, was to talk about the sentence itself, not attack the convicted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go back to your seat,” he said. “Can I just skip over all of that?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe conceded and she continued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe death penalty was too easy, she said, an easy way out. She requested the maximum possible sentence in prison.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t let the way he hurt my family rule how I’m going to live my life,” she said after the hearing. “This isn’t about Dustin McCowan, it’s about Amanda Bach.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the judge announced his sentence, he noted allegations that McCowan had been violent toward other women in the past. Although he had blocked those allegations from the trial, he considered them in deciding the punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCowan was accused of once grabbing a girl by the shoulders and shaking her violently because he was angry. Another time, he was accused of pushing a girl down the stairs, letting her fall into the basement. He was never charged in either case.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhispers of “yes” and “should’ve been more” escaped from the Bach side of the courtroom as the judge read the sentence. The McCowans looked forward with red eyes and Kleenex in hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter appointing a public defender to appeal the case at McCowan’s request, Alexa ordered McCowan out of the courtroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re finished with him,” the judge said. “We’re done.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Did you know that in a group of 100 rapists, only three will spend time in jail? Because I sure didn’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to research rape and abuse statistics for an essay recently. I considered myself well-versed in women’s rights, but what I found shocked me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all, the fact that people still try and pin the blame for rape on women because of the clothes they wear or because they go out — and hey, if the girl didn’t want sex then why is she such a slut — is possibly the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, the more I learned about rape and abuse, the more I thought the fact they are still categorized as only women’s rights issues cuts out a huge chunk of the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile women’s rights was the driving force behind the movement and legislation to protect sexual assault victims, this issue has broken out of being just about feminism.\\r\\n \\r\\nIt has become larger, and scarier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt isn’t just women who are the victims of sexual attacks and domestic abuse anymore. Children of both sexes are considered one of the biggest groups of victims, followed closely by homosexual males and immigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I went to look at the process for the prosecution of a rapist, I found there wasn’t really one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many forms of abuse, of which only a small percentage are prosecutable. Many women don’t recognize when they are being abused, because they don’t have available resources, support and/or confidence in the system that should exist to help them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I researched, I remembered sitting in a health class in high school, learning that in a recent survey, 35 percent of the participants said they would rape if they had the chance and if they thought they could get away with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n35 percent. And if all the men that make up that 35 percent commit a rape, only 3 percent of them will have to worry about being punished for their crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is shocking to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that’s just rape in which the victim is a physically adult female. Every 2 minutes, someone is sexually abused or attacked.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I found even scarier was when I met with my professor to discuss my outline for my essay, and later when we peer-edited in class, both my professor and my classmate said they were completely unaware of this aspect of the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were like me. They thought they knew all there was to know about rape and abuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it turns out, we were all far from knowledgeable, and that needs to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to start working for the victims, not for the victimizers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— ewenning@indiana.edu',\n",

Candidates for next year’s administration have taken the Culture of Care into consideration as they plan their platforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasey Shelburne, Hoosiers 4 Solutions’ presidential candidate, said he and his running mates plan to keep the Culture of Care program if they are elected.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s still going to be Culture of Care,” he said. “We’re not looking to rebrand it into anything different.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he said Hoosiers 4 Solutions wants to expand Culture of Care beyond campus and make changes at the state level. For example, they have called for an expansion of the Lifeline Law so victims of sexual assaults would not be charged with underage drinking when they report the assaults to the police.\\r\\n\\r\\nShelburne said he feels education for incoming freshmen on Culture of Care issues — alcohol and drug abuse, sexual assault, mental health — is important to causing a shift in campus culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When you come to Indiana University as a freshman ... you should have this expectation that this is IU, and this is not acceptable,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShelburne said he would like to see reduced alcohol abuse at IU sporting events, as well. Hoosiers 4 Solutions proposed selling limited beer and wine at games to reduce binge drinking pre-games.\\r\\n\\r\\nSPARC for IU representatives said they want to change the Culture of Care program from an awareness campaign to an “action campaign.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We think that by increasing workshops around campus and offering optional classes for students to take, Culture of Care could be a much more effective campaign,” said Tom Dauer, SPARC’s candidate for vice president of congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nSPARC presidential candidate Sidney Fletcher said he would lead SPARC to build on existing workshops run by the Office of Student Life and Learning to incorporate more of the Culture of Care topics. He said bystander intervention workshops have been proven to dramatically reduce rates of assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nFletcher said he and his running mates would look at data from student surveys to see if the Culture of Care is catching on in tangible and intangible ways. However, SPARC Chief of Staff Ty Nocita said the data may not be a consistent predictor of change, as numbers may initially go up as more people report things like assaults, before they go down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe YOUniversity ticket has adopted several platforms based on the Culture of Care, and co-Chiefs of Staff Katy Flanigan and Dia Sharma serve on the current administration’s Culture of Care steering committee. Flanigan said she is passionate about expanding these programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nYOUniversity representatives have called for a revival of tailgating at sporting events. They hope to accomplish this by introducing food vendors and water stations at the fields to decrease dangerous drinking habits. They also want to re-introduce handles so people will not binge drink before arriving at the fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The drinking that is dangerous is what’s happening before the games,” Flanigan said.\\r\\n \\r\\nFlanigan said she and her running mates want to expand the Night Owl bus routes to include North Jordan and Kirkwood, as well as extending the hours. She said this would increase campus safety by decreasing the number of students walking at night. Flanigan said YOUniversity also wants to modify Culture of Care’s structure to encourage more student participation in steering committees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough all three tickets have platforms that incorporate programs, the candidates agreed Culture of Care would likely take more than a year to take hold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Throughout this whole year, our mission has been to lay the foundation for Culture of Care so it can be a sustainable project,” Flanigan said. “It’s not going to\\r\\nhappen overnight.”',\n",

I was the tousle-haired manifestation in 2004 of that television trope circa 1960.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was the little boy with a farmer’s tan who reeked of gasoline wrestling a lawnmower across a postage stamp of grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nI made my first independent dollars as an entrepreneur cutting lawns by undercutting my competition. He was charging $25, so I charged $20.\\r\\n\\r\\nI learned a valuable lesson that day. Eight years later it was formalized in an economics class.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a homogeneous labor market — like prepubescent lawn mowers — with a fixed amount of labor demanded, the wage is the least amount necessary to entice the marginal worker demanded to do the job.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 2-3, the student body of IU will hire a new slate of executive representatives. Three teams want the job. We only have room for one.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoosiers 4 Solutions and SPARC for IU are willing to do the job for free.  YOUniversity wants a stipend. Currently, that stipend stands at $18,000 total.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don’t have to be an economics student to figure this one out.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome say there is significant opportunity cost associated with being involved with student government at such a high level, and therefore these students deserve compensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey’re absolutely right, but that doesn’t mean compensation has to be in the form of dollar bills.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s pretty clear the résumé entry “student body president” and the many networking opportunities it offers have significant value of their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf someone is willing to do the job for only this non-pecuniary type of compensation, why pay someone who isn’t?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” you say, “because you might get a better product from the people you pay than from those you don’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is exactly what YOUniversity claims. It’s been involved in previous administrations, it’ll be more effective in office than any of its competitors, it’s worth $18,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nYOUniversity claims this salary keeps the executives honest and makes them work harder for students because if they don’t perform, if they don’t follow through, this salary can be taken away by the organization’s supervisors.\\r\\n\\r\\nYOUniversity claims it’s worth your money because it knows how the system works. But that’s exactly the problem. The system — the one that five of the ticket’s six candidates are directly involved in — doesn’t work.\\r\\n\\r\\nMovement for IUSA has moved next to nothing in return for their collective $18,000 salary. Instead it was blindsided by a merger of one of IU’s most prestigious schools and a bill to disenfranchise out-of-state students.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has practically ignored movements representing significant student activity. It has invested thousands in touch screens few care about while budgeting a meager $500 to Lifeline Law awareness, a lifesaving law that, according to the administration’s own Vision of the Ideal College Environment report, only 60 percent of students are aware of. Meanwhile, for every sexual assault you see covered in this paper, there is one more no one will ever report. \\r\\n\\r\\nMovement for IUSA was dead on arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most effective IUSA administrations, the Big Six ticket of 2010-11, accomplished everything it did without finding it necessary to draw a salary.\\r\\n\\r\\nYOUniversity claims its proposed salaries are the lowest in the Big Ten and, through some clever budgetary sleight of hand, that they make up only 0.6 percent of IUSA’s total budget per executive, for a total of 3.6 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut $0 is still the least in the Big Ten. And as a percentage of the executive budget, out of which comes spending for initiatives such as the Hoosier Info Kiosks and Lifeline, these salaries make up almost 20 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour money, a whole lot of it in fact, could be freed up in this upcoming election. $18,000 can do a lot of good.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t pay for an inferior product when you can get a superior one for free.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— drlreed@indiana.edu',\n",

Hoosiers 4 Solutions’ representatives said in the release that they, too, believe underreporting is related to social stigma associated with sexual assault, but they want to ensure no one can be legally punished while reporting an assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the release, a survey by the U.S. Department of Justice showed 54 percent of sexual assaults go unreported.\\r\\n\\r\\nKathryn Flanigan, the YOUniversity ticket’s candidate for chief of staff, said she agreed with Hoosiers 4 Solutions that encouraging victims to report crime is important, and it is necessary for people to know they are not going to be prosecuted.\\r\\n\\r\\nYOUniversity is working to continue the current IUSA administration’s Culture of Care program to promote campus safety, she said, but they plan to focus on campus culture instead of working on state policy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do think it’s encouraging to see that all of the tickets are recognizing this as an issue,” Flanigan said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said she thinks it is important for student leaders to work on decreasing the rate of sexual assault on campus and increasing the rate of reporting assaults by raising awareness of the right to report and be protected. They also want to promote bystander intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\nFletcher said SPARC for IU wants to encourage bystander intervention as well, and they are currently developing an optional course that would teach individuals and student communities to intervene in emergency situations and notice warning signs so they can take initiative and possibly prevent those situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said they want to set goals to train a specific number of students in bystander intervention, and increase the capacity of training groups. He said he feels this would be helpful not only in preventing sexual assault and medical emergencies, but also bullying and harassment cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We hope that in the short term a culture of care would increase reporting,” he said. “In the long term, the idea is to make the rates of sexual assault go down.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFlanigan said she thinks public discussion by student leaders is powerful.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think we as student leaders should be focusing on the sexual assault issue because the numbers have shown that it’s not going away, it’s not decreasing,” she said. “Any efforts to reduce the sexual assault rate are good in my book.”',\n",

       "  'body': '“Girls,” HBO’s comedy series that just aired its second season finale, has never shied away from controversy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeries creator Lena Dunham has come under fire for many aspects of the show, from its almost entirely white cast to the plots, which are generally #firstworldproblems. But last week’s episode, “On All Fours,” has viewers divided on an even more contentious question.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe episode asks the audience to decide the nature of a sexual encounter between one of the main characters, Adam, and his new girlfriend Natalia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the opening scene of the episode, Adam and Natalia have their first sexual experience after Natalia decides she’s “ready to have sex now.” Adam hesitates, only wanting to do it if she’s ready. She consents. Natalia also lists her sexual expectations. Adam is willing to adhere to these demands, going as far to say, “I like how clear you are with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the episode’s end, things between Adam and Natalia are rather ambiguous. Adam, an alcoholic who has been sober for years, awkwardly runs into his ex-girlfriend, Hannah, and decides to order a drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a night of continued drinking with Natalia, they go back to his apartment and he demands she crawl on all fours to his bed. She hesitantly consents. He proceeds to throw her on the bed and have sex with her from behind. She hesitates and says she hasn’t showered. Adam tells her to just relax. He begins to masturbate and she hurriedly pulls her dress down so he doesn’t ejaculate on it. Natalia tells Adam, “I don’t think I liked that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as when sexual assault happens in reality, things between the fictional characters of Adam and Natalia might seem intangibly vague depending on who you ask.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome might say Adam raped Natalia, plain and simple. She was uncomfortable with what happened and he should have stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers would argue that she never specifically said “no” to Adam and it can’t be categorized as rape. For my two cents, I don’t think this is the question we should be asking.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think what we should be asking is how and why the character of Adam came to believe it was OK to treat a sexual partner in such a demeaning manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether you want to categorize it as rape or not, it was still wrong. It doesn’t make a difference if the word “no” is used or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nA person should be conscious enough with their partner to know if he or she is uncomfortable and if a line may have been crossed. An open channel of communication needs to exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, what we are observing here is Adam’s creative journey as a character. He is a flawed human being who doesn’t always do the right thing, just like all of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is what draws an audience to him. He isn’t showing up on girl’s doorsteps with flowers and a copy of “The Vow.” I wouldn’t want to watch that show. I want to watch the show with an emotionally stunted young man still learning the difference between right and wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo ultimately, I applaud Dunham for writing this scene, because it quietly establishes two things.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne, a mental block to your sexual partner’s attitude is something that must not exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo, just because you do a bad thing does not make you a bad person. Once Adam is done having sex with Natalia, a look of horror washes over him. He knows exactly what he’s done and he regrets it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDunham leaves it up for you to decide if Adam sexually assaulted Natalia or not, just as it’s left up to you to determine your own personal boundaries and be able to assert them under difficult circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— wdmcdona@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': \"HYDERABAD, INDIA -- Metal doors clicked open, and the creaky train spat crowds onto the cement platform. Akshaya tried to catch her breath as people thudded past her, knocking into her hips and shoulders. She panicked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe teenager had run away from home. Her father was a heavy drinker who beat her, her mother and her siblings. She was tired of it. Carrying a bag filled with clothes and silver anklets to sell, she boarded a train destined for Hyderabad, one of India’s largest cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer excitement withered as she stepped onto the cement platform. The crowds pressed closer. She was scared, and she told herself she belonged at home with her family. She resolved to catch the first train going back and scurried to the information desk near the station’s main entrance. She asked a man behind a thick glass window how to go home, and he told her the next train to her village would leave around 3:30 p.m.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat was five hours away. She turned away from the window, and a handsome, well-dressed young man approached. He spoke Telugu, her first language. Hindi and English are India’s official languages, but most Indians learn languages native to their home state first, then tack on more if they are able to go to school.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man told her there was no need to wait in the hot, crowded station. He lived nearby, and she could stay with him for a few hours. He promised to bring her back in time for her train. Charmed, she agreed, and they left together in a rickshaw bound for his two-room house. At the time, she was 18 or 19, she isn’t sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce indoors, the man locked Akshaya in a back room. He and his friends raped her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny IU freshman who has experienced both fear and elation arriving for the first time in Bloomington has felt echoes of Akshaya’s account. But the lives of IU freshmen unfold in a familiar pattern of classes, tests and career planning. Akshaya entered her new life with nothing but her clothes and a handful of dreams, which were shattered by the smooth-talking stranger.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next several months, two or three men raped her each day. Afraid she would run away, they would not let her leave the house. They finally let her outside after those first few months, but only so she could start earning money for them. They told her she would become a prostitute. She said no and begged them to let her go home, so they beat her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she wasn’t meeting customers, Akshaya was kept locked in the room with no phone. She had to ask for a drink of water or to use the toilet. She tried to run away two or three times, she can’t really remember. Each time, the man or his friends would wait at the bus and train stations nearby. They dragged her back and beat her with belts, leaving lumpy bruises and slicing into her skin. She gave up.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo American readers, Akshaya's story is horrific. In India, social workers say it is wretchedly common.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nA round scar from one of many beatings is visible on her wrist as she tucks a strand of smooth dark hair behind her ear. Some of the scars on her arms are pale, some dark, some lines, some circles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been five years since Akshaya was first enslaved, and now she sits in a chair in a small office above an ice cream shop talking about those early years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way she is dressed today screams of her former work. Indian women call it “chamki,” the Hindi word for glitter, an equivalent of “bling” and considered gaudy. She wears delicate pink eye shadow over almond-shaped dark eyes framed with slightly arched plucked brows. Her deep red sari is sewn with quarter-sized sequins in the shape of flowers and whorls – more sequins than most middle and upper-class Indian women would wear. As she gestures, her wrists clink with dozens of red and crystal bangles.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe leans back in the plastic chair when she finishes a sentence, and the tassels hemming her sari click together. She listens to others speaking, and a smile splits her face, pressing her eyes into crescent moons and showing off small dimples.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many people throughout India and across the world, Akshaya heard about the vicious sexual assault in New Delhi in December. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a 23-year-old medical student, died in the hospital after she was gang raped and beaten by several men. Their trial is underway. In the days since her attack and especially following her death, protests sprouted throughout India. Women marched in the streets, demanding protection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAkshaya walked in one such march, more to support her friends than to confront women’s treatment in India. When pressed, she admits the Delhi rape case confuses her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no trace of malice in her voice, only curiosity, as she asks a question in Hindi. Why did so many people protest that young woman’s rape and beating, she wonders, but when sex workers are murdered, no one says anything?\\r\\n\\r\\nAkshaya isn’t angry, just confused. In India, many women are taught to stay indoors after dark, go out only in big groups and stay in well-trafficked areas. If they don’t follow these rules, some consider it probable that they will be sexually assaulted, possibly murdered. She simply doesn’t understand why one murder gained more attention than all the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe is far from the first person to notice this disparity. Jaya Singh Thomas is a project manager at a nonprofit organization in Hyderabad that helps former sex workers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One girl was raped in Delhi, and the entire world stands up,” Jaya Singh says. “Thousands and thousands are cheated and killed every day, and no one says anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome women now have power and choices. As its economy continues to grow, India is increasingly modernizing, especially in its major cities. The lives of many women in this rapidly changing society are shifting, but some, like Akshaya, are left behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nHina Alam used to work as a journalist in Hyderabad and currently lives in Bloomington after doing postgraduate work at IU. She has a deep understanding of how women are treated both in Hyderabad and in Bloomington, and she is able to draw comparisons. In India, she says, if a woman wears jeans or a tight top, men often view her as available. Even Hina, a respected professional woman, carried safety pins while she lived there. If a man made a grab for her chest or backside, she jabbed him with a pin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough American women have the freedom to show more skin, stay out later and become friends with more men, Hina points out that sexual violence still courses through American society. In the United States, it is a quieter suffering. In India, she says, the problem is so blatant that people are forced to face it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a busy part of a city nearly 8,500 miles away, Akshaya is asked what she knows about American women. The question embarrasses her. She admits she’s jealous of the freedom women have in the West.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S., she has heard, women don’t have to be home before dark. They can leave the house alone and feel safe. They can go with friends to see a movie, as the victim in New Delhi did, without fearing what happened to her will happen to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican women can do whatever they want, she says. She smiles, a little sadly, and looks away.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nAkshaya’s bracelets play soft music as she gestures. Her voice rises in volume and pitch, and she leans forward in the plastic chair. She’s talking about why she couldn’t escape. She’s remembering the beatings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pimps attacked Akshaya frequently, though they never broke bones. They needed her to keep working. Her customers hit her, too, and the pimps didn’t mind. When men paid for her, she belonged to them, no restrictions. She remembers a time a man took her to a wooded area, stripped off her clothes and told her to do things to him she wasn’t comfortable with.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer voice is flat, and she rubs one hand against the opposite arm as she speaks. Akshaya refused to do what he asked, and he whipped her with his belt. He shocked her with a Taser, she says. She returned to the pimps’ house bleeding and aching. The pimps did nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey charged Akshaya's customers between 1,500 and 3,000 rupees, equivalent to $30-60, per customer, and she got to keep 100, about $2, of it for transportation to and from the house. She met customers everywhere from five-star hotels to dirty hovels. Some treated her like a girlfriend, buying her little gifts and food. Many others treated her like property they didn’t mind breaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years passed in a long cycle of more customers, more beatings. A police officer was the first person to offer her a chance to escape, though not through legal means. The officer had been her customer two or three times, and he asked her to live with him. He would take care of her, he said, and he promised to pay the pimps each month so they would leave her alone. The pimps agreed to the deal, and Akshaya finally moved out of the locked bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer had always been kind to her, but he didn’t stay that way. After another year or so, the officer told Akshaya he didn’t have the cash to support her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe families of Hindu women traditionally pay a dowry as part of a marriage deal, though the practice was outlawed in 1961 and is slowly dying out. When Akshaya mentioned marriage to the officer, he laughed at her. His parents could get him a wife with a hefty dowry, he claimed. Akshaya had nothing to offer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe officer made her return to prostitution. Akshaya began to work in the area around the same railway station where she’d disembarked years before and been overwhelmed by the crowds. Now she solicited them. Her clothes drew eyes, some disapproving, some curious and some interested, and she waited for men to approach her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen from a nonprofit agency approached her while she looked for customers in that station. They were giving free HIV tests in a van outside. Akshaya didn’t know what HIV was. They explained, and she agreed to a test. Akshaya was healthy. She told them about her profession and how she’d become a sex worker.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next few months, they tried to persuade her to abandon her work.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How long will you be able to do this?” some asked. Though she was in her early 20s, she would grow old, they argued, and she wouldn’t be able to work anymore. She would have nothing. How would she live?\\r\\n\\r\\nShe didn’t have an answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organization that counseled her in those days still works with sex workers in Hyderabad. Its name is Chaithanya Mahila Mandali, or CMM, a string of Telugu words that mean “light from darkness,” “women” and “group.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words are both a message and a retelling of the founder’s story. Jayamma Bandari, called “amma,” or mother, by many of the women in CMM’s shelter, explains it calmly in many retellings. Years ago, her husband sold her into prostitution. She turned to a nonprofit similar to CMM for support and was hired to generate and coordinate plans to help sex workers. Jayamma established CMM as a clinic and shelter specifically for women and children who have been victims of prostitution. As with Akshaya, CMM employees and volunteers try to identify prostitutes throughout Hyderabad and convince them a better life is possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not an easy task, as the city’s demand for sex workers remains high. Hyderabad is a crossroads. Many highways that connect north and south India intersect here. Natural disasters, like droughts and floods, drive people from the East and West into the city. Corporations have sprouted throughout Hyderabad in the last decade.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people at CMM say Akshaya is doing much better. She’s built a life that hasn’t included sex work for the last six months. Still, her friends have reason to worry. Too many people are ready to see Akshaya as a paper cup you crumple up after you’ve drained it. A used woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly on a recent Tuesday afternoon, Akshaya pushes through throngs of people on the sidewalk toward the glass windows of a roadside restaurant. She is no longer overwhelmed by the crowds, as she was five years ago. Still, as she enters the dining room, she glides left and right to avoid bumping into anyone. She hunches her shoulders and keeps her head down, as if she’s afraid of being in someone’s way.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one stares at her as she heads for a back table. There is no scarlet letter marking Akshaya or her past, and today she is dressed more modestly in a red and yellow scarf and top and dark gray sneakers. Her shiny dark hair is held back by a jeweled clip. She’s wearing one purple bracelet on her left wrist and a watch on her right.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe orders water but has to be convinced to eat lunch. She wants to lose weight, but she reluctantly agrees to share a few vegetarian curries and a plate of flat bread called roti. After someone else orders for her, she checks her phone a few times. She’s seeing if she has any messages from Venu, the man who fills her life now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked to describe Venu, Akshaya grins and looks up at the ceiling. She says he’s a little chubby and lightly smacks her stomach, laughing as she adds, “Like me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVenu, a young businessman, met her after a friend gave her his phone number. Assuming he was a customer, Akshaya agreed to meet him at a bus stop. She got into his car, and for half an hour he asked her about her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAkshaya grew irritated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have to go,” she insisted. “I have a customer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVenu told her to forget about the other customer and gave her 1,000 rupees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAkshaya doesn’t know exactly what drew Venu to her. They met again about one month later, talking on the phone in the interim.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few months, Venu and Akshaya moved into a rented apartment together. They plan to marry, though they haven’t set the date. They see Telugu movies together, go grocery shopping and sometimes stay home and watch television. He spoils her with gifts, such as a white scooter that gives her the freedom to explore Hyderabad alone. She cooks food with less kick than she would like because he hates spicy food. Their relationship is light-hearted and sweet.\\r\\n\\r\\nJaya Singh and Jayamma are bothered by one aspect of it, though. Venu is already married and has a child.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not unheard of in some areas near Hyderabad for men to marry two or three women, Akshaya says, so her family did not think this arrangement was odd. She isn’t bothered by it, either, and Venu assures her it will be legal. Marriages after the first are not recognized by the law, however. Regardless of what Venu tells her, many will consider Akshaya his mistress rather than his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nJayamma, Jaya Singh and her friends at the shelter are counseling Akshaya to be cautious and think about all the possible outcomes of her relationship with Venu. CMM offered Akshaya a job helping with office work or identifying sex workers in the city. But Venu wants her to stay home and gives her whatever she needs. CMM offered her a fallback, but she refused to take it.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenu and Akshaya visited CMM together early in their relationship. Jaya Singh asked him if he was planning to stay with Akshaya long-term. Venu said yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nJaya Singh shrugs. “Well, so did the police officer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nAkshaya says she will never be a prostitute again.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe doesn’t wear makeup while she’s at home, and her dark eyes aren’t quite as prominent. Her smile dominates her features, instead. In a marked contrast to her usual shy walk – head down, shoulders up – she practically skips from the living room to the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe has reason to be happy. Venu is home early today, sitting in the living room watching television while she cooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaby, her three-month-old miniature Pomeranian, is still damp from a bath when Venu arrives, and Akshaya bounces from patio to tiny kitchen to living room, trying to cook and entertain all at once. Baby wriggles around her feet, nibbling her toes, and Akshaya admonishes her half-heartedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nVenu came early today to bring her groceries, but he generally visits her from 3:30 to 8:30 p.m. every day. Venu eats a late lunch with her but goes home to his wife and child for dinner and to sleep. Akshaya sleeps in a double bed alone, with Baby in a basket nearby. The walls of her bedroom are decorated with posters of babies sitting on grass, in costumes or just smiling. Akshaya loves children. She and Venu talk about having one boy and one girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nAkshaya has vague plans for her future. She has thought about opening a small business decorating and sewing parts of saris, but it’s a possibility that has barely blossomed in her mind. She is content in her domestic haven with Venu, and she has little motivation to change it. Venu has offered to supply the capital to open the shop. She plans to design and decorate fabric for a sari for herself. If people admire it, she’ll start making clothes for others.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer dream is tenuous. She has to rely on many assumptions about Venu’s intentions and her own talents to make it feasible. But even unsteady plans are better than years of not looking forward at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Kenney, a senior in the School of Journalism, is studying abroad in Hyderabad. Workers at CMM introduced her to Akshaya, who gave permission to publish her name and photo. A Hindi translator helped Akshaya and Kenney speak to one another.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"On Sunday afternoon, I went running.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was gorgeous out--sunny, bright and cold. I needed to relieve some stress, and I just wanted to put my earbuds in and run until I couldn’t run anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people of Bloomington were sleepily staying in, doing work or watching TV.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought I would have the town to myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me start by saying I had on relatively modest running gear — opaque leggings, athletic shoes, an oversized T-shirt and a sweatshirt. It was nothing remarkable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, for some reason during the 45 minutes I was outside, running through seemingly deserted neighborhoods, I got honked at three separate times, yelled at by two men on scooters — pretty smooth, guys — slowly driven behind once, and catcalled by people on porches twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of my run, I was seeking out one-way streets and running in the opposite direction of traffic so I could avoid being caught unawares and having my butt shouted at. I was uncomfortable, intimidated and confused.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike I said, I’m no Victoria’s Secret model. I’m just a normal girl who was wearing frumpy workout gear. I couldn’t figure out why so many men had gone out of their way just to catcall a makeupless, sweaty, semi-gross-looking woman attempting to exercise.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what I’ve realized, probably a little late, is that catcalling isn’t about expressing appreciation for a woman’s appearance. The people that yelled at me on my run are probably the same people who yell incoherently at me out of cars when I’m walking home from the newsroom in the evenings. They’re the ones who wolf-whistle when I’m walking to my car from my promotional job at the bars.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot because I’m a goddess incarnate — because I’m a woman, and I’m there in front of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome would argue that IU, like many a college campus, has a culture of shouting.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it warms up, people sit on their roofs and holler at passersby. Many of my male bike-riding friends have had obscenities thrown at them for no apparent reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome would argue that yelling at strangers is just a non-sexist phenomenon, meant to be all in good fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nI refute that.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe infrequent targeting of men doesn’t make the majority of catcalling less generally sexist or misogynistic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overwhelming majority of people who are targeted by catcalling and vocal intimidation on campus are women.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overwhelming majority of people doing the vocal intimidation are men.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt doesn’t take a scientist to tell you that — ask any female IU student.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis catcalling is the manifestation of a few different problems on our campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt reflects the overwhelming problem we have with objectifying women — an obvious point, but one that must be addressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the women on this campus don’t wear leggings — a noted male favorite — solely to invite male appreciation. We wear them because they’re easy, they’re comfortable and they look slightly less sloppy than sweatpants. If we’re exercising, we wear them because they’re practical.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf certain articles of female clothing literally drive you so insane with lust that you must shout about it, you’re no better than the hormonal middle school boys for whom “no shoulders and fingertip-length skirts” female dress codes are enacted. Learn some self-control and respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s OK if women want to look sexy. But simply finding a woman attractive doesn’t give you the license to intimidate her or to express sexual attraction she may be uncomfortable with. Looking sexy isn't an invitation for sex, and saying we should change what we wear to avoid these interactions is classic victim blaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore generally, some may argue that driving slow behind a running girl or yelling at her from your porch is all in good fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nPut yourself in her shoes. Sexual assault against women in Bloomington is incredibly prevalent. Do we think you’re actually going to chase after us and rape us? Probably, hopefully, not. But that doesn’t make intimidation acceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is because catcalling women, at its core, isn’t a compliment or an expression of appreciation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s an intimidation tactic. It’s a way for some men to express that they are still the powerful ones and that we are here for their objectification and for their pleasure. It’s a way of instilling fear, of saying, “Don’t forget that I’m always watching, always judging.” It’s a literal expression of the male gaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for most women, it isn’t funny, attractive or enticing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen of Bloomington, learn to control yourselves. Don’t honk or holler if you don’t know me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd please, please let me go on my runs in relative peace.\\r\\n\\r\\n— kelfritz@indiana.edu\",\n",

       "  'body': 'When Indiana’s Lifeline Law took effect last July, it was a major victory for last year’s IU Student Association administration, which had helped bring the issue to our state legislature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law protects those who, though inebriated and underage, act in good faith with law enforcement while seeking medical attention for a dangerously intoxicated friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the IUSA ticket, Hoosiers 4 Solutions, this legislation is not enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault has become an increasingly visible problem at IU, from an Indiana Daily Student feature article about the issue that prompted a spirited debate among students to the sheer number of reported rapes that have occurred so far this calendar year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IDS has reported on eight rapes since January.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoosiers 4 Solutions wants to expand Indiana’s Lifeline Law to help mitigate this problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current law only provides immunity for those helping someone in an “alcohol-related health emergency.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSolutions’ addendum would provide immunity for those reporting a sexual assault as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the current legislation, it is possible that someone could report a rape and be prosecuted for any of the crimes Lifeline provides immunity for: public intoxication, minor possession, minor consumption and minor transportation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA drunken student could easily be punished on top of being assaulted for simply trying to bring their rapist to justice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe threat of such charges needs to be removed to allow for increased reporting of these crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause alcohol is involved in at least 50 percent of sexual assaults, it is imperative we remove this barrier to reporting.\\r\\n\\r\\nRape is a violent crime, not an “alcohol-related health emergency,” and is therefore not included in Lifeline in its present form.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there is only a low probability that alcohol charges would be filed in the face of assault allegations, the possibility is there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s a possibility I am uncomfortable with and a possibility with serious symbolic implications.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a Justice Department survey, only 46 percent of rapes are reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means that for some reason or another, 54 percent of victims felt unable to tell the police they were assaulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nExpanding the Indiana Lifeline Law could potentially raise the rate of reporting.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictims of sexual assault often fear reporting the crime because of the victim-blaming that has permeated common thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nEspecially if alcohol was involved, these people are made to feel as though they somehow provoked this attack.\\r\\n\\r\\nPassing a law that ignores minor alcohol violations in the face of a sexual assault report is an important step toward removing the stigma against victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaw enforcement would no longer formally dignify these claims. Perhaps legal forgiveness would be the impetus some victims need to forgive themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf IU’s population coincides with national statistics, about 4,350 students have been victims of attempted or completed rape. This number is unacceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to address the problem of sexual assault on our campus, and this expansion of the Lifeline Law is a step in the right direction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— casefarr@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The U.S. Department of Education recently sent a letter to school officials across the country urging them to take more steps to end gender-based violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter, signed by U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, said President Barack Obama declared February 2013 National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gender-based violence has serious consequences for victims and their schools,” the letter reads. “Witnessing violence has been associated with decreased school attendance and academic performance. Further, teenage victims of physical dating violence are more likely than their non-abused peers to smoke, use drugs, engage in unhealthy dieting, engage in risky sexual behaviors and attempt or consider suicide.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2012 report, 9 percent of high school students reported being hit, slapped or physically hurt purposely by a boyfriend or girlfriend in the year before the survey was conducted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, 15 percent of adult men and 22.4 percent of adult women who experienced rape, physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner had first experienced relationship-related violence between the ages of 11 and 17.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Department also released a toolkit to help schools utilize available resources to help students.\\r\\n\\r\\nShani Robin, crisis intervention services coordinator at Bloomington Middle Way House, said although teens only make up about 10 to 15 percent of cases each month, they spend a lot of time in schools teaching high school students how to prevent violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndiana currently has the second-highest number in the country of sexual assaults among teens, Robin said.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the four-day information session, they start by talking about gender stereotypes and end with rape, sexual assault and what constitutes consent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems to be effective,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also address same-sex rape, because Middle Way does not agree with the Indiana definition of rape, which states that rape can only occur between people of the opposite sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle Way’s definition is “penetration into any bodily orifice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a very in-depth curriculum,” she said. “We don’t sugarcoat anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to information, Middle Way also recruits students to be advocates and confidants for their fellow peers. When students do show up to Middle Way, she said each case is handled differently, but said the most important aspect of recovery is a good support system.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We live in a victim-blaming society,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCierra Olivia Thomas-Williams, prevention programs coordinator at Middle Way, agreed with Robin. She said there is nothing one can do to prevent a rapist from raping someone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are all at risk of this,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas-Williams said schools are overwhelmed by the large number of students compared to the number of teachers, resulting in a lack of appropriate supervision during passing periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said schools are also too tolerant of certain actions, such as girls smacking each other on the butt and boys punching each other as “greetings.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is a misunderstanding of the actual behaviors that are going on in the student body,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas-Williams said it’s important for schools to admit there is a problem and realize even verbal and mental abuse should be considered sexual violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe noted last spring semester, a sophomore student at Bloomington High School North committed suicide after being called a “slut” every day. She said if the damage isn’t visible, people are less likely to call it a crime.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They seem less harmful, but they’re not,” she said.',\n",

Thomas-Williams works with teenagers to build healthy relationships and healthy sexuality.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My inspiration is my own victimization or my own survivor hood,” Thomas-Williams said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTonight, Thomas-Williams will be one of three panelists speaking after the 8 p.m. airing of “Shadows of Innocence,” a documentary produced by WTIU and WFIU of\\r\\nBloomington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe documentary examines the statistics released last summer in a joint study between the Center for Evaluation and Education Policy and the Kinsey Institute. The study revealed that sexual assault has been a serious problem in Indiana for decades, said Sara Wittmeyer, WTIU and WFIU news bureau chief.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is an epidemic in Indiana,” Wittmeyer said. “It’s a public health crisis.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically, the study revealed high rates of rape and sexual assault among Indiana’s youth. One in five teenage girls is raped in Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the issue affects so many, it affects everyone, Wittmeyer said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sexual violence affects everybody whether they know it or they don’t,” said Erik Scheub, director of media and public relations for the Indiana Coalition Against Sexual Assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an attitude that sexual assault won’t happen to you, Wittmeyer said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Indiana ranks as the state with the second highest rate in the nation of forced sexual intercourse for girls between ninth and 12th grades. Indiana is second only to Wyoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue lies in the culture of Indiana, Thomas-Williams said. The state’s social norms and attitudes portray masculinity and femininity in traditionally stereotypical roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of sexual violence, men are often depicted as perpetrators, while women are the victims, Thomas-Williams said. The Indiana rape code does not mention same-sex assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttitudes toward sexual violence need to change, Scheub said. However, this discussion will also vary upon region.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Scheub noted, attitudes can vary across the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indiana Coalition Against Sexual Assault is in the early stages of piloting research that will collect samples from various communities across the state.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd according to Thomas-Williams, this change needs to come in the form of new policy. With a change in policy, a change in the culture can follow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we get consent for our actions, we will change the relationship between people,” Thomas-Williams said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRape prevention isn’t always possible, Thomas-Williams said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will never ever say what a teen could do to protect themselves from rape,” she said. “If a rapist is in the room, we are all at risk for being raped.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon prevention tactics, such as advising teens to travel in groups, does not stop rapists, Thomas-Williams said. Many victims know their rapists, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the difficulty of preventing rape, Indiana’s Sexual Violence Primary Prevention Council developed goals between 2007 and 2009 to help reduce the rate of sexual violence. According to the CEEP and Kinsey report, the Council has identified the want to facilitate awareness of their plan, build capacity to prevent sexual violence, support communities in prevention, enhance social norms, include as much of the population as possible in the effort to prevent and enhance the data collection on sexual violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWittmeyer said the documentary intends to start a discussion of an issue that demands more attention. “Shadows of Innocence” closes by talking to Indiana residents who are living after their assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile “Shadows of Innocence” examined other states, such as Minnesota and its progressive sexual assault policies and cultural attitudes, it focuses on what makes Indiana different, Wittmeyer said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why is Indiana so much worse?” she asked.

       "  'body': 'Republican senators in Indiana killed a bill last week, while Democratic representatives in Colorado passed one. Both actions will leave college students more vulnerable to attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenate Bill 97, authored by Sen. Jim Banks, R-Columbia City, died last week in Indianapolis after the Rules Committee denied it a hearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill would have made it impossible for any state-funded university to ban a person with a concealed carry permit from carrying a gun on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, in Colorado, one of five states that permits concealed weapons on college campuses, a bill passed through the Democratic-controlled House that would allow college administrators to ban guns on campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill would negate the March 2012 decision of the Colorado Supreme Court that determined the University of Colorado’s gun ban on the Boulder campus unconstitutional.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Colorado legislators passed the bill despite the evidence of a 90 percent drop in the rate of sexual assault after Colorado Springs University legalized concealed carry on campus in 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Indiana, it’s curious why a supermajority GOP Senate would fail to push for a campus concealed carry bill to reach the supermajority GOP House.\\r\\n\\r\\nColorado Rep. Joe Salazar, D-Thornton, explained why he would vote against campus concealed-carry legislation in the face of the decrease in sexual assault concealed carry laws bring:\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re right: there are some gender inequities on college campuses ... It’s why we have call boxes, it’s why we have safe zones, it’s why we have the whistles. Because you just don’t know who you’re gonna be shooting at.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you don’t know if you feel like you’re gonna be raped, or if you feel like someone’s been following you around or if you feel like you’re in trouble when you may actually not be, that you pop out that gun and you pop ... pop around at somebody.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you might have just made a mistake.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSalazar’s implication is that women with guns will not use them wisely. Women are too irrational and too paranoid to know when they are actually being attacked. They might shoot a non-attacker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, besides, who needs a gun when we have call boxes! And whistles!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd don’t forget, as Sen. Jesse Ulibarri, D-Commerce City, pointed out, ballpoint pens, or, as Minnesota Rep. Paul Rosenthal, D-Edina, aptly added, mace, tasers, the buddy system and judo.\\r\\n\\r\\nDemocrats, apparently, think women are too stupid and incapable to defend themselves with guns.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, the government has done enough to protect women — they don’t need to be responsible for defending themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disturbing thing is that the attitude of our campus administration is the same as that of the Colorado legislators.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Newtown, Conn. shootings — which occurred in a gun-free zone — IU President Michael McRobbie announced the campus would “continue to enforce a general ban on firearms on our campuses.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMcRobbie insists that women rely on the University for protection and denies them the opportunity to yield the most effective and proven tool against attackers: a gun.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome women, like Crayle Vanest, Indiana’s state director for Students for Concealed Carry and the IU chapter president, refuse to accept the administration’s denial of her right to self-defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and other SCC members are planning a week-long demonstration on campus called the Empty Holster Protest on April 4-9. During the protest, students will wear empty holsters to campus to show how the administration’s policies disarm\\r\\nstudents.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The goal is to raise awareness for the cause and open student’s minds to the reality that university policies infringe on our state and federally guaranteed rights,” Vanest said.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents should support SCC until our state leadership and University administration allow us to exercise our God-given right to self-defense.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil then, ladies, never leave the house without packing your whistles and ballpoint pens.

       "  'body': 'Many IU students believe that when a woman is raped or sexually assaulted, she shares blame for the crime — maybe because she had too much to drink, went somewhere alone with her attacker, or because she and the attacker had had consensual sex before. We believe that this idea presents a serious obstacle to creating a culture of care at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with this notion of shared blame is that it’s based on a myth — the myth of men as predators and women as prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt goes like this: Men are savage beasts that cannot control themselves sexually, and if a man wants sex, any woman around him is at risk of being raped.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen are therefore expected to take precautions to prevent rape from happening. For example, women are often told to carry pepper spray, not dress too promiscuously, not let strangers into their houses, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a woman behaves in these ways, it is imagined that she is willing to have sex — she’s “asking for it.” And if she is raped when engaging in any of these behaviors, people believe that the victim shares as much blame as the rapist.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here’s the reality: men can control themselves! They are not helpless in the face of sexual desire!\\r\\n\\r\\nRape is not about sexual desire; it is about control, and it’s not an accidental thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with many college campuses, this practice of victim blaming is prevalent at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a campus, we have a responsibility to end this practice. Rape is a violent and traumatizing crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose of us working on the Culture of Care initiative believe that IU, as a community, should be above blaming rape’s innocent survivors.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe should instead turn our attention to those who commit rape and the culture that allows them to do so with shared, rather than complete, blame.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone can do something to fight against this culture of victim-blaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou must always ensure that your partner is willing to consent. You should look out for your peers at parties and step in when you see something wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, when approximately one out of four college women and one out of 36 college men are survivors of sexual assault, you must remember that when discussing sexual assault, many of the people listening might have lived through one.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, when you speak or write about sexual assault, do it with thought and\\r\\ncompassion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to build a community where everyone is safe, we must hold perpetrators accountable for their actions rather than blame innocent survivors.

The April protests being organized by IU’s occustrikers are not being done right.\\r\\n\\r\\nA beginning step in waging a successful political protest requires having reasonable demands, or at least feasible ones. The IU occustrike movement has neither.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs obvious as it seems to most of the world, we cannot expect the University to lower the cost of attendance while providing better services, raising wages for staff and making the University more accessible to the less fortunate.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps they could protest to lower tuition rates and provide fewer services or pay staff less — and certainly there are under-qualified people teaching in the humanities departments who deserve a pay cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, occustrikers, the thing you are demanding — a cheap public university with sound services that remains accessible to all — already exists. It’s called community college.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother component of successful political protest involves remaining legitimate so that activists can translate the protest into political capital.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny group that spawns from the Occupy Wall Street movement, though, threatens its legitimacy before the first inane slogan can be chanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of occustrike’s supporters have ridiculed me for merely asking in a recent\\r\\ncolumn if the occustrikers would engage in similar behavior as the original occupiers did after I speculated — correctly, in fact — that many of the radicals were involved with or supported Occupy Wall Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was at Occupy,” they say. “And I didn’t rape anyone.” Well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s like a klansman claiming he’s not racist because he’s never lynched anyone. Good for you for not lynching anyone, but that doesn’t mean you don’t belong to a racist organization.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood for all the occupiers who haven’t raped anyone, assaulted anyone, threatened anyone, ingested illegal drugs, stolen property, vandalized property, committed arson, posed a public nuisance, defecated in public and gone a month without bathing. It doesn’t mean OWS isn’t a filthy, lawless movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it doesn’t mean that Bloomington is immune from the madness, either.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake this lead from an October 2011 Indiana Daily Student article: “An 18-year-old man reported to police that he woke up at about 1 p.m. Thursday handcuffed to a bed in a white house near 17th and North Dunn streets. He told police he feared he was sexually assaulted.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere was he before the white house? People’s Park, where the occupiers had set up camp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man met two women there who gave him alcohol and, he claimed, drugged him before imprisoning and possibly raping him in their house.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuming the April demonstrations could succeed even in theory, all students who value civil obedience and respect the rule of law would hesitate to join the cause for fear of being abused.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike OWS, the Tea Party successfully turned its grievances — among them, a distaste for crony capitalism, a grievance shared by the occupiers — into political clout.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Occustrike to succeed, it will have to emulate the Tea Party. This starts by establishing reasonable demands and assuring the student body its tactics will remain civil.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill you propose protesting anything that could actually be changed?\\r\\n\\r\\nWill you, like the Tea Partiers, retire to your houses at night after the rallies because you have to work the next morning?

       "  'body': 'Dear Michael Barbieri,\\r\\n\\r\\nI will be brief — I know articles about sexual assault “are not met with the same degree of enthusiasm” for you as others.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou seem to believe that rape survivors share the blame because they have “a role to play” and that rapes can be avoided if the survivors had not played with fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are participating in victim-blaming. 100 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn no way whatsoever is a rape survivor responsible for being raped.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing a rape survivor could have or could not have done justifies being raped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “reality” you envision insinuates that if a girl invites a stranger over, she should expect to have sex because that’s all men want.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis revolves around the assumption that men are superior to women, and that women are only here for men’s sexual desires, and furthermore that women should expect men to enact their sexual desires upon them, and if women don’t take precautions, they share the responsibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is unfair, Michael. For men, for women, for society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis encourages people to blame rape survivors for being raped. This encourages “don’t get raped” instead of “don’t rape.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYour letter is cruel. I say this as a survivor of rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am certain I speak for all survivors when I say that your words make our lives harder, because you have unearthed the aforementioned thinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nI frequently ask myself: What if? What if instead of having him drive me home I had walked?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat if I had gone straight home after work instead of hanging out with friends?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat if I hadn’t told him, in response to his “I’m hungry,” that I had Pop-Tarts (for shame, the most childish food possible) in my room and he could have some? What if?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it doesn’t matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter what, I didn’t deserve what happened, and I share zero of the blame.\\r\\n\\r\\nRape survivors share zero responsibility for being raped; insinuating or claiming otherwise perpetrates them further.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only way to end rape culture is to not rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you educate yourself and apologize for your words.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— Rachel\\r\\n\\r\\nEditor’s note:\\r\\nNormally it is IDS policy to publish the first and last names of those who submit letters to the editor.

       "  'body': '#INeedMasculismBecause was trending on Twitter last week, and like all things masculism, the ensuing argument broke the Internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nMasculists pitted themselves against feminists in a Twitter battle as fruitless as every other Internet fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the unacquainted, masculism is the ideology of men’s rights activists, who claim that feminism overshot, resulting in the oppression of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow the white rabbit down the glory hole that is the men’s rights subreddit for a more wide-ranging glimpse of just how society is keeping men down, with posts and comments that sometimes read like a circle jerk of the Nice Guys of OkCupid.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of the movement is that many of these men have legitimate concerns, but they are articulating them in a way that is alienating and offensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nCustody laws that inherently favor the mother, the incarceration and treatment of the prison population that is mostly male, the marginalization of male victims of sexual assault and abuse and other issues are problems that need to be addressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these problems arise not due to oppression, but due to a history of flawed thinking in regard to gender.\\r\\n\\r\\nSaying that male-bodied persons are being systematically oppressed is not a great way to endear people to a cause. To be oppressed, one must be disempowered. As we live in a patriarchal society founded, built and run by men, there is an obvious dissonance in the lamentations of men’s rights activists.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough no research has been conducted on the demographics of MRAs, their concerns seem to imply that many are experiencing\\r\\n\\r\\noppression — oppression in the form of classism or racism, not misandry.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the institutionalized biases that do exist against men, MRAs would do well to stop pitting themselves against feminists and instead join the more established movement.  \\r\\nConstructions of masculinity are already being studied and discussed in gender studies classes around the country, and most feminists are aware of the negative effects of patriarchy on men.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of these men seem to realize that something is being taken away, and it doesn’t feel fair. But that something is the privilege that comes with being male.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost men will never take a class that requires readings by exclusively female authors. There is no need for a male Bechdel Test, because male characters in movies are usually important and discuss topics other than women.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMen still hold an inordinate amount of CEO positions and seats in Congress. When a man runs for president, no one will wonder if America is ready. He will never be asked what designer he’s wearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nMRAs raise important issues, but they are misguided in asserting that male voices are being overshadowed by those of women and transgendered individuals. Trans men and women are some of the most invisible people in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdjust the rhetoric, tone down the misogyny and perhaps we can actually address the problems about which MRAs are rightly concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— casefarr@indiana.edu',\n",

Urasky said they are a strong asset to the community, and PHA is making sure that the sisters are attending training and are available to chapter members.\\r\\n\\r\\nIFC vice president of membership development Grant Ryan said they are creating a group called Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault that will be comparable to PHA’s Safe Sisters. Ryan said they are meeting with Sexual Assault Crisis Services at the IU Health Center on Friday to discuss details on the program.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The programs have a lot of validity,” Ryan said. “The women have Safe Sisters and we want the same opportunity for men.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIFC vice president of communication Sean Jordan said they are reaching out to all members, but are especially trying to get the attention of younger members.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We want them to realize the issue before they get too many ideas on what college life should be like,” Jordan said. “We want to help them moving forward. We want to make the effort sustainable and lasting. We want to ingrain the values into their lifestyle now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, IFC and PHA have only approved the mandate of bringing in educational speakers to every chapter to talk about sexual assault.\\r\\nPagrabs said they are working on changing recruitment in the fall to be more value integrated and are basing their actions on the three pillars of awareness, education and support.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We want to attack the problem from all angles,” Pagrabs said. “We want to set an action plan moving forward.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJordan said using the three pillars as their guide will help them make sure their efforts are successful. He said sometimes messages get lost in translation between chapter leaders and chapter members, but creating new programs and partnering with other safety organizations on campus would help.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We like to think of ourselves as leaders not just in the (greek) community, but in the entire IU community,” Jordan said. “We hope as we implement this new change, IU will change accordingly.”',\n",

In that time, I’ve read many columns with which I disagreed, often vehemently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn’t until last week, however, that I was left completely stunned by how much a column aggravated me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a column titled “From Occupy Wall Street to IU Strikes” a fellow opinion columnist tried to argue that the Occupy Wall Street movement was dominated by “rich white guys with advanced degrees” and that these men were “committed to crippling the American economy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSimultaneously, he claimed that occupiers were “dirty and disruptive, using drugs and committing rape.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could talk about my own experience with the Occupy movement, how it brought me together with people of all genders and races willing to struggle for a better world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could also point out that we live in a country obscenely rife with sexual assaults, reported and unreported.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the rapes of women in OWS camps to paint the movement as somehow distinctly dangerous is not only illogical, but offensive to both the women assaulted and to the survivors of sexual assault who took part in the movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could discuss these things at length, but I don’t believe his argument deserves such a rebuttal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn reality, last week’s column only served to distract from the real issues raised  by the proposed IU strike.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile my fellow columnist was busy tilting at leftist windmills, the organizers of the strike were circulating a list of demands which addresses the concerns of IU students, workers and faculty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are demanding an end to the constant tuition hikes that have driven so many of us into devastating debt and have kept others from attending the University at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimultaneously, we are demanding that the administration un-freeze the wages of IU staff who are being forced to work long hours for minimal compensation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe know there can be no victory for students without a victory for workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nStrikers of all races are together demanding the administration meet its promise to increase African-American enrollment.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther, IU must offer in-state tuition to all Indiana residents, including undocumented residents.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese demands were not written behind closed doors.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were not conceived of by a secret society of rich white men as part of a plot to “cripple the American economy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IU Strike demands emerged from long discussions between students, workers and faculty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe came together to take back a university which has been hijacked by a self-interested and out of touch administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt speaks volumes that my fellow columnist was forced to caricature the organizers of the strike as drug-addled rapists in order to discredit the movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, how can anyone argue against demands for affordable education, a diverse campus and fair wages for workers?\\r\\n\\r\\nI doubt that my fellow columnist will join the strike in April, but no matter what he thinks, we’ll be fighting for every member of the IU community.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you agree, then I’ll see you on the picket line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— atcrane@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'It was about 1:45 a.m. on a cool Saturday in September 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nA female IU student had already been to the Vid and had already drank at the Bluebird Nightclub. She thought she was done with the bars for the night. The group of five she started the night with dwindled, and she returned to her apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer best friend called, begging her to come back out. She agreed. She found a ride and arrived at Kilroy’s Sports Bar at 2 a.m. They stayed until close — 3 a.m. — and wandered to the Taco Bell next door.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and her roommate were “shooting the shit” when he walked up.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wore jeans, a collared shirt and a black zip-up sweatshirt. He had brown hair, brown eyes and an average build. He asked for a lighter.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an IU junior that night. She’s now a senior, and a rape victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said his name was Brandon. He said he was a 23-year-old psychology major at IU and that he was from Ellettsville, Ind. She now doubts his story.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe invited Brandon to head home with her that night from the Taco Bell parking lot. She made it clear to him she didn’t want to have sex. She thought they wouldn’t go much further than making out. He seemed accommodating.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile “fooling around,” he pinned her arms back so her hands were at the sides of her head. She froze. And then he raped her, taking her virginity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 17 months after the rape, she’s more eager to be the sober driver for nights out drinking. But she refrains from making a rule to always be in charge of car keys for the night. Making rules doesn’t help her admit it wasn’t her fault. Friends still suggest she not get drunk “this time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That doesn’t make sense,” she said. “Instead of ‘don’t rape,’ people say ‘don’t get raped.’ It’s not fair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nDrunk sluts. Loose morals. Not fighting hard enough. Staying out too late. Wearing short skirts. It’s called “victim blaming.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIU Health Center counselor Debbie Melloan has worked with sexual assault victims at Counseling and Psychological Services for 23 years. Despite the University’s sexual assault outreach and prevention programs, IU students don’t seem to engage in victim blaming much less than the general population, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictim blaming, Melloan said, obscures one key point: Sexual assaults happen because a perpetrator decides to disregard consent and do what he or she wants. No matter how much women or men curtail their alcohol consumption or how closely women watch their hemlines, they don’t have control of a rapist’s decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All of us do things every day that can create our vulnerability,” Melloan said. “But, it takes somebody else to decide to exploit that vulnerability for a sexual assault to happen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMen aren’t the only culprits. Melloan said women blame female victims as a defense mechanism. Feeling vulnerable and scared, women find ways to separate themselves from sexual assault victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stayed at the party when her friends left, but I don’t do that. She blacked out, but I don’t do that. She went into the guy’s bedroom, but I don’t do that.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s sort of a way to give yourself this false sense of security so that you don’t have to deal with your own vulnerability,” Melloan said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roots of victim blaming reach deeply into traditional gender roles. Melloan explained that, historically, in heterosexual relationships, women are the gatekeepers, responsible for protecting their virginities.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen have historically been portrayed as hormone-crazed and unable to control sexual desires. The sexual revolution only granted women permission to have premarital sex about 40 years ago, she said, but previous gender roles haven’t disappeared yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s sort of this assumption, then, that if something happens that the woman doesn’t want to have happen, then it’s her fault for not having kept the gate shut,” Melloan said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are ways to reduce the risk of being sexually assaulted. However, a better approach, Melloan said, is looking at the environments in which assaults occur. Rather than concentrating on the victims, she suggested concentrating on attitudes and behaviors that allow sexual assaults to happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelloan referred to social stigmas, such as cigarette smoking. Thirty to 40 years ago, American society didn’t condemn those behaviors, she said. But society recognized they were harmful. Today, smokers can’t light a cigarette in many public places.    \\r\\n\\r\\n“That would be my hope that, as a campus or as a culture, that we have the same sorts of stigmas against treating women that way and disregarding ‘no’s’ that we do around some of those other behaviors,” Melloan said.\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nThe victim’s roommate convinced her to shower after the rape. For the first time, the victim saw the physical damage — bruises, bite marks and blood covered her body. The day after the rape, she went to IU Health Bloomington Hospital with her best friend and her roommate for a sexual assault exam.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe needed medical attention, and she wanted documentation of her rape. She completed a rape test kit with a sexual assault nurse examiner and a Middle Way House volunteer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It validated that it happened,” the victim said. “And no one can ever take that away from me, because there’s proof.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe didn’t want to report it to law enforcement. She was too afraid they wouldn’t believe her story. She felt she would be attacked by public opinion and a defense lawyer. She was drunk, and she invited him home. She didn’t want to hear what people would say.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That right there is enough for our society to question it,” she said. “That’s enough, no matter what ... I would look like a drunk slut with a regret, and that’s too much to bear.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost everyone in her life who knows she was raped knew within the first week after it happened. She stopped telling people after she told her cousin. Her cousin, a female similar to her in age, tried consoling her: what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then she said, ‘You know, you learn from things, so you’ll know better next time.’ That just ...” she  paused. “I stopped telling people after that, because it made me feel like shit.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe has heard a similar refrain from others. She was working in a group in a German class when she overheard an adjacent group discussing sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree students — two women and a man — argued rape is never the victim’s fault. But the remaining male group member wouldn’t budge. What if a girl was drinking, he argued, and went on to list other conditions for shared blame.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I just wanted to throw a book at his head,” she said. “Not even the fact that he said that, just that he needs to say that in private, because you don’t know who you’re hurting when you say something like that.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That kind of stuff cuts you like a knife.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nAn on-campus group of about 20 students is trying to change the victim-blaming culture. Raising Awareness of Interactions in Sexual Encounters, or RAISE, gives presentations to educate student groups about sexual communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest part of the presentation is a sketch of a sexual assault between two fictional characters, Tom and Amanda.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive female and two male students sat in the audience for one of RAISE’s presentations. RAISE Co-President Tori Martindale and her male counterpart Grant assumed the identities of Tom and Amanda and told the story of Amanda’s sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanda was a freshman and Tom was a junior. Tom was throwing a house party, and they were both drunk. They started talking, headed downstairs to Tom’s bedroom and made out on his bed. Tom reached for the button on Amanda’s pants. Amanda said no.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I stopped trying to take off her pants and just put my hand down ‘em,” Tom said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom unzipped his pants. He pulled aside Amanda’s underwear.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Tom,” she said. “No, Tom, stop it. We need to stop.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Tom didn’t stop, and they had sex. Shortly after, they headed back upstairs to the party.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe I should have screamed or tried to hit him, but I don’t think I really wanted to believe this was happening,” Amanda told the audience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe audience asked questions to clarify the incident. How many times did Amanda say no? Why did she go downstairs? Did Tom think he raped her? Was Amanda drunk?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presentation stopped. Tori and Grant asked for a show of hands — who thinks it’s a sexual assault? Six out of seven audience members raised their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho thinks it’s only Amanda’s fault? No one raised a hand. Who thinks it’s only Tom’s fault? Blank stares ahead. No one’s hand moved.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho thinks Amanda and Tom share the blame? Audience members exchanged glances. Heads started to nod. A wishy-washy hand went up, fuchsia-polished fingernails tilting back and forth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think maybe she should’ve done more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe she should speak up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, she did. She did say no,” Tori said. “And, no matter how she said it, he heard it. No means no. There’s nothing more that she should’ve done or could’ve done to avoid that situation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTori explained to the audience that they’ve engaged in victim blaming. That they said it was Amanda’s fault because Amanda could’ve done more to prevent the assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone rarely says Amanda deserves all the blame, but audience members commonly believe Amanda and Tom share the blame.\\r\\n\\r\\nRAISE needs a male and female to do the presentation, but they only have one male presenter. RAISE Co-president Kelsey Britt said some sexual assault education can demonize men. Although their skit involves a male assaulting a female, RAISE wants everyone to receive their message, regardless of gender.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey’ve had a few presentations get ugly. Audience members have said vulgar things or didn’t take the presentation seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nFemale audience members have blamed Amanda. Tori and Kelsey said it’s a defense mechanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe audience’s gender mix makes a difference. Mostly female audiences buffer against rude comments, because they often feel more personally affected by sexual assault, Tori and Kelsey said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey repeated statistics Melloan cited: one in six women will be sexually assaulted — one in four during college years — and one in 33 men will be sexually assaulted. Several sexual assault advocacy groups and government agencies, including the United States Department of Justice, cite similar statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nKelsey and Tori know they’re never going to eradicate sexual assault. They said the best they can hope for is to improve communication between sexual partners and increase awareness around campus about issues related to sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s such a widespread problem, and the roots of it are just so deep in our society,” Kelsey said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can feel kind of powerless,” Tori said. “Like you can’t fix it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn each presentation, they teach bystander intervention techniques: distracting the aggressor, directing a victim to resources, letting a victim choose his or her course of treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not just the two people who are having the interaction,” Tori said. “There’s this thing going on this whole year about Culture of Care, and it’s about us taking responsibility for other people to make sure everyone is happy, healthy and safe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nShe — the IU senior — has a piece of paper with a number on it. The number corresponds to a box sitting in Bloomington Police Department’s storage. The box is her rape test kit. It’s filled with Brandon’s silver watch, pictures of the physical damage he did to her and her recollections of what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had a tough time relating to her male friends after the rape. She has drifted away from her closest male friend. Every time she brings it up, he falls silent and changes the topic of conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe divided the men in her life in two groups: they were compassionate if she told them, or they were in the “you could be rapists, too” group.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe emphasized over and again that her judgments aren’t fair. She knows not all men are rapists. But Brandon seemed fine. What’s stopping another normal-looking guy from being a rapist?\\r\\n\\r\\nSix months after the rape, while talking to a friend one night outside a party, one of her male friends overheard her discussing the rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe called her every day for a week to check on her. He still calls occasionally to ask how she’s doing. He told her he wished he knew sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That made me feel like it was okay to have men back in my life,” she said. “And, maybe they’re not all people who won’t understand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly 17 months later, the all-consuming downward spiral has slowed, and she has days when she can get up, go to work and run errands. Therapy helped immensely. She’s still struggling with classes, but not as badly as she did in the immediate aftermath. She’s comfortable around and comforted by her male friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe’s not sure if she’ll tell more people in her life. She’s afraid she’ll be looked at differently or interrogated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do wish society was different,” she said. “Because there are times I’m mad he’s out there.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Regardless of your political leaning, it’s hard not to find a deep irony in the way many people have responded to the announcement that women would now be allowed to serve in military combat roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the outcry about the recently proposed changes to gun control policy, it seems there is a vocal percentage of the population that believes civilians should be entrusted with assault rifles — just not women.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe the objections to women serving in combat are no more valid than the ones offered against gay marriage or the desegregation of schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t think these objections are raised out of secret misogynistic tendencies, but rather from ignorance of underlying thought processes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s my sincere hope that I may cause disgruntled readers to rethink their position about this.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if I have assumed incorrectly and you are the sort of person upset by things like the Equal Pay Act and women who work, it is actually my sincere hope that you’re violated by a rabid badger.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman won’t have the physical strength of her male counterparts  \\r\\n\\r\\nLike cocaine or anal sex, fighting is something we men have mythologized, precisely because society so rarely provides us the opportunity to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, two men can always resolve their differences through hand-to-hand combat.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, a lot of male self-image is tied up in how closely we resemble Rambo, even though it’s all largely hypothetical, since most of us don’t go through our adult lives punching people in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe military has already announced that any women in combat will have to meet the same standards as their male counterparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s not like we don’t already have female bodybuilders, wrestlers or roller derby players.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sentiment assumes that all women are inherently physically inferior to men.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt stems from the insecurity that the percentage of people who could beat you in a bar fight is ever-growing.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen should feel privileged not to fight on the front lines\\r\\n\\r\\nThis objection runs counter to the last one, acknowledging that women could fight, but why would they want to? Why would they want to have to work full-time jobs, vote or go to school?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe short answer is they do for all the same reasons men do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central premise of equality is judging people by their capabilities, not what their reproductive organs are.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe presence of women will create lethal sexual tension\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, this is a valid concern for people who are basing their research off Military MILFs VII.\\r\\n\\r\\nI mean, it’s hard to imagine men working side by side with women without orgies spontaneously erupting, and not even the good old gay male orgies that terrified us a few years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrankly, this one is just as offensive to the men, implying there’s no way you could control yourself around your co-workers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf military discipline and live ammunition can’t convince soldiers to focus on their jobs, I shudder to think what could happen if civilian men and women ever start working together.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do we need more combat troops anyway?\\r\\n\\r\\nI mean, Christ, we’re not starting another war, are we?\\r\\n\\r\\nI have the deepest respect and appreciation for anyone willing to enlist in the United States military, regardless of gender.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, with certain factions shaking their fists at Iran while looking meaningfully across the table at North Korea, it’s my sincere hope that we begin needing fewer combat troops, not more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— stefsoko@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The ban on women in combat has been lifted.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing last year’s lawsuit pressed by four servicewomen that challenged the 1994 ban, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced women will be able to serve in combat as early as this May.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was immediately excited, but soon I questioned myself for being happy about women gaining formal legal equality to kill for the military industrial complex. It seemed like a hollow civil rights victory that won’t actually help many women.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I read the comments sections for articles about the change. Comments everywhere from The Washington Post to Mother Jones to Fox News were so disappointing they were hard to believe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s all too easy for me to forget how many people deeply believe women are inferior to men or intrinsically suited to middle-class feminine roles.\\r\\n\\r\\nMen’s rights advocates and other misogynists often argue women are privileged for their ineligibility to serve in combat. That’s about to change, even if it doesn’t change much in reality.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have women in combat roles right now. We are just not able to promote them,” former Navy Lieutenant Carey Lohrenz said in an National Public Radio interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new circumstances mean women will become eligible for 238,000 military jobs and proper recognition for their roles in combat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are substantive changes that will challenge anti-women sentiments and reveal some of the basic assumptions and violences committed by gender-normative sentiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, liberal feminist theory often eludes meaningful confrontations with co-articulated oppressions based on race, class and sexuality in its arguments for individualist equality. But there’s a tactical place for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s get this right: access to combat roles in the sacred U.S. military will change controlling images of women in dominant culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent language about women in the military represents and enforces widely felt misconstructions about women as a category.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen’s limited role in the U.S. military has long been used as evidence to naturalize binaristic gender difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen’s weakness would jeopardize their fellow soldiers. Women aren’t capable of leading men in battle. Women can’t handle tough battlefield conditions. Women would distractingly sexualize the frontlines. Women are always getting too pregnant to fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllowing women access to previously restricted roles can at worst destabilize some of these assumptions and at best force online commentators to change their tune.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this change was paired with comprehensive reform on the treatment (cover-up) of sexual assault and rape within the military, it’d be an even greater victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the lifted ban stands, it’s important to remember the way we talk about people relates how we perceive and interact with the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— ptbeane@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': '5:43 a.m. July 8, 2000\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sleepover.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 14-year-old boy and his friend were sleeping in a mutual bed. The 14-year-old awoke to the sensation of a touch on his genitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfraid and unsure of what to do, as if paralyzed in a state of shock, the 14-year-old pretended to sleep. The other boy began performing oral sex on him and following the initial sexual acts, proceeded to force himself inside the victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 14-year-old ultimately reported the series of events that unfolded that summer morning to Bloomington police.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the report, a rape kit was completed at an area hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis case, as it is recorded in police records, was a sexual assault. In fact, it was a number of things according to Indiana Code, including sexual battery and criminal deviate conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, according to the code, it wasn\\'t \"rape.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\n\\r\\nIndiana law does not constitute sexual assault as rape unless it is between members of opposite sex. However, there is deviate conduct, “a person who knowingly or intentionally causes another person to perform or submit to deviate sexual conduct.”\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestigators and prosecutors typically file for criminal deviate conduct when an accused person makes forced sexual contact through means of anal penetration, oral penetration  or penetration with an object without the victim’s consent or if the victim is in a state in which they cannot grant permission.\\r\\n\\r\\nProsecutors, psychologists and advocacy leaders have made it clear that a change is necessary — some even calling the current code “archaic.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were at least 21 reported same-sex sexual assaults from 2000 to 2010, according to Bloomington and IU police records.  During the same time period, about 680 other sexual assaults were reported between members of the opposite sex. From January 2011 to September 2012, there were at least nine same-sex sexual assaults reported. In less than two years, there were almost half the number of incidents that were reported in the previous 10 years. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Middle Way House Domestic Violence and Rape Crisis Shelter is a sought-after resource for victims of sexual assault, both male and female, in Bloomington.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We de-gender the crime,” said Shani Robin, Middle Way House crisis intervention services coordinator. “We don’t go by Indiana Code, and that’s deliberate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSixteen percent of all sexual assault cases at Middle Way House involve male victims, Robin said. The perpetrators in nearly all the cases: other men.\\r\\n\\r\\nRobin said sovereignty is at play. Given that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has its own definition of “rape,” the laws differ from state to state. Her answer to the issue: education. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, visiting lectures and classes, she said, can only do so much. In her experience, people hear the statistics related to sex crimes and will oftentimes display signs of legitimate concern, but fail when it comes down to implementation and action.\\r\\nAs members of a nonprofit advocacy group, Robin and her associates’ involvement in pressing for legislation can only go so far.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We can’t necessarily lobby in our positions,” Robin said. “We’re restricted by the government as a nonprofit. It lies in the hands of the people to care.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTerms such as “deviate” act as curveballs to Robin and her team. “Loaded terms,” she calls them — terms that can incite “traumatic” reflections and repercussions for victims.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We know language matters,” Robin said. “I know that the label of sexual deviance is a loaded term, and that kind of term can be traumatic to someone that’s been raped by a member of the same gender.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Middle Way House, the sanctions and response are the same regardless of terminology, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A survivor is a survivor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\nIn September 2009, the Monroe County Prosecutor’s Office established a sex crimes deputy prosecutor position thanks to a federal stimulus grant.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor about two and a half years, Rebecca Veidlinger occupied that position. Then the grant expired at the beginning of 2012, and the county didn’t have the funds to sustain the position. But during her time as the  sex crimes deputy prosecutor, Veidlinger said she became an expert in handling such cases. The cases she handled, at the time, were exclusively sex crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo when the grant expired and the money ran out, she became a felony deputy, an arrangement that still allowed Veidlinger to specialize in sex crimes but handle a copious mix of other types of crimes, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m going to get comfortable,” she said, propping her legs atop her desk. “The legislation I’ve seen essentially does away with criminal deviate conduct as a separate crime and just incorporates it into rape. And so under the proposed legislation, a forced anal penetration by one man of another man would be rape.”\\r\\n\\r\\nState Sens. Sue Landske, R-Cedar Lake, and Brent Steele, R-Bedford, co-authored a bill that would do exactly that.\\r\\n\\r\\nSenate Bill 374 underwent its first reading Jan. 8.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf passed, the legislation would “merge the offense of criminal deviate conduct into the crime of rape.” It would also repeal the statute defining the crime of criminal deviate conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2012, the FBI expanded its definition of rape to include male victims as well as forced anal and oral penetration. Until that point, the definition had remained unchanged since 1929.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim,” the FBI’s most recent definition reads, versus the old definition of “the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe redefinition was implemented in hopes “of leading to a more comprehensive statistical reporting of rape nationwide,” according to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The Indiana change would not be a substantive kind of change,” Veidlinger said. “It’s a language change.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSubstantive, she said, means something that is illegal becomes legal or something that was previously legal becomes illegal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe law is actually not gender-discriminatory in the sense of a sexual assault, she said. Criminal deviate conduct is the same level offense as rape considering they’re both Class B felonies and under the same conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because you’re calling one ‘deviate conduct’ and one is called ‘rape.’ And although it’s ‘deviate,’ sometimes people misspeak and call it ‘deviant.’ So it’s a legitimate criticism of the language, for sure,” she said. “Language carries judgment with it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nVeidlinger said sexual assault is one of the most underreported crimes in the country, citing that the number of same-sex assaults not reported perhaps surpass the amount of non-reported male-female sexual assaults three-fold.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can tell you right now, what the legislature is focusing on, is they’re completely revamping the criminal code,” she said. “The whole criminal code — massively. This is what all the prosecutors across the state are talking about.”\\r\\n \\r\\n***\\r\\nThe walls that make up the perimeter of the IU Health Center’s fourth floor are largely consumed with motivational posters and wooden racks flooded with self-help pamphlets.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany detail information about various crisis service centers as well as treatment and counseling resources for sexual assault victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nGary Stepp, known to most as “Brad,” is a psychologist working out of the health center’s Counseling and Psychological Services.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think there are certain barriers to disclosing, not only to the police, but also to mental health providers, that they’ve been sexually assaulted by someone of the same sex,” Stepp said.  “Some perceive that the police would not take it as seriously if it’s a same-sex sexual assault, which given Indiana’s code, I don’t think that that’s an unreasonable fear and a fear that has been substantiated over the years.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStepp said he works with his patients, including victims of same-sex sexual assault, in an open-ended manner, encouraging them to arrive at their own realizations. He steers clear of pressuring them into pursuing formal charges or prosecution.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I try to be very careful not to push on them on what I think they should do, because I feel it takes away some of the power they’ve already had taken away because of the sexual assault,” Stepp said.  “I really try to support them, he said, and empower them the best I can.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSame-sex sexual assault may very well be under-reported on the IU campus, he said, and it needs to be addressed and discussed.\\r\\n\\r\\nParty scenes and intimate relationships, he said, are the types of situations in which this type of assault is most likely to occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even though the current law in Indiana doesn’t currently recognize their trauma in an equitable fashion as non-same-sex sexual assault, there is support for them,” he said. “They are not alone. Absolutely not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n***\\r\\nAs Shani Robin expressed her frustration with the system, her voice, at first calm, became increasingly concerned and flustered.',\n",

I had been depressed for a long time, but everything felt magnified by college.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought the death of my father when I was a child had gouged a deep hole in me and that I had seen death too early for it to ever be filled. I was convinced everyone around me was blissfully unaware of pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorst of all, I was addicted to the idea that my anguish made me special. No matter how much I hurt, how could I ever look for a cure for the thing that made me unique?\\r\\nInstead of taking notes in class, I would sit quietly and mentally draft different versions of my suicide note.\\r\\n\\r\\nI spent my nights fantasizing about an X-Acto knife lurking in my desk.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomehow I found the courage to enroll in therapy. The first time I snuck into the IU Health Center I thought I would throw up in the lobby, but it saved my life.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people aren’t so lucky. I can remember at least two suicides at IU during my time here. There are nearly one million suicide attempts in America every year, and someone successfully takes their own life every 13.7 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrey was a survivor of sexual assault, and in the note he left he lashed out at those who trivialize rape through comedy and then hide behind the veil of free speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe knew that the words we use reverberate outwards and affect our entire society.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s time we acknowledge the damage we do when we discount the pain of depression and suicide.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll too often we ignore the obvious warning signs in others or simply tell them to cheer up.\\r\\n\\r\\nJokes about suicide are used to express frustration or for crude shock value, but there’s nothing shocking to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s only the banality of hurting others. Before we speak we must consider what those around us might be feeling and hiding.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can’t think of a more fitting tribute to Trey than for his life and his words to echo through our campus and to change the way we live with and love one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts, please call Counseling and Psychological Services at 812-855-5711.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— atcrane@indiana.edu',\n",

Each day focused on a different aspect of Culture of Care.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We wanted to encourage bystander intervention … looking out for your fellow Hoosier and making it your personal responsibility to make sure that people around you are being safe and being healthy,” said IUSA President Kyle Straub. “What we want to do this year is take what we learned from Culture of Care week last year and use that to make it more effective.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDia Sharma, Culture of Care co-chair, said last semester was “mostly legwork.”\\r\\nLast fall, IUSA invited presidents of major organizations on campus to a leadership summit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We want to encompass and understand a lot of problems on this campus, so we reached out to other student unions,” Sharma said. “We want to make sure they’re on board.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Culture of Care is all about getting students to be proactive and avoid problem situations before they arise,” said IUSA Chief of Staff Augustin Ruta.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the upcoming semester, Sharma and her co-chair Katy Flanigan hope to do more to involve IU’s student body.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re hoping to host a speaker series featuring speakers that are related to each of our focuses,” Sharma said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are also working on a website that would make information available to students.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some people might not feel comfortable coming to the events or might not have time,” Sharma said. “It’s still in the development stages, but we want to make these resources available online.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSharma and Flanigan want to reach out to students and ask them which issues they think are important in relation to the Culture of Care.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A lot of times students will come to us with issues, but one thing we want to work on is going to the students,” Sharma said.\\r\\n\\r\\nStraub is worried about the number of incidents related to Culture of Care issues that could have been prevented if students were aware of their rights and resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are growing numbers of incidents where people aren’t intervening because they aren’t sure if it’s acceptable, they aren’t sure what to do,” Straub said. “Some of these issues are really stigmatized, and they’ve never really been addressed by our student government.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStraub said he believes the initiative is already making a difference through projects like the Hoosier PACT and Lifeline, broader legal programs, which were largely achieved by last year’s administration to encourage people to report medical emergencies related to alcohol abuse without the deterrent of legal consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve seen at the local hospital that the number of alcohol-related incidents in which other people have intervened have skyrocketed. I don’t think people are drinking more. I think that the number of reported incidents has gone up because people have felt more empowered to intervene,” Straub said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We want to create a conduit between groups on campus that have these problems in their communities and the services on campus that have the resources to help and combat these issues,” Sharma said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough not many events related to the Culture of Care are scheduled for the upcoming semester, Ruta said that the focus is to change students’ mindsets and teach them to take preventative measures. \\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it’s easy for people to say that there’s nothing happening, but not everything is tangible,” said Ruta. “It’s a long-term initiative, it’s not going to be finished in two months.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The New York Times recently ?released a report of a new military study claiming that rapes and sexual assaults in the military had increased 8 percent in the last fiscal year.This number is nothing compared to the 50 percent increase in reporting of the year before that.This increase in reporting can mean one of two things: the actual number of sexual assaults occurring is increasing, which would, of course, be bad, or that more people are feeling comfortable and safe enough to come forward about their experiences.The real reason, unfortunately, is most likely a mixture of the two.Recently the issue has been brought into the media spotlight. A ?documentary called “The Invisible War” and multiple popular TV shows, such as “House of Cards,” have been bringing attention to this issue.Multiple bills in Congress have ?addressed reform within the armed forces to try and combat sexual assault.All this attention has perhaps made survivors of sexual assault feel that they would be able to find justice and solace in exposing their experiences.On the other hand, despite the ?discussion that is now arising about this particular injustice, neither of the recent bills addressing it in Congress have actually passed. This means that no change in the systemic silencing of sexually assaulted men and women has actually been implemented.This led Senator Kirsten E. ?Gillibrand, the headliner of a bill to remove ?prosecution duties in cases of sexual ?assault from the chain of command, to believe the assaults are actually ?increasing.Whether the number increases? because the number of reports is going up or the number of attacks is going up, the important thing to focus on is that the number is going up at all and how high it actually is.The New York Times reported that a Pentagon study from this year ?estimated that while 5,400 rapes and sexual assaults were reported, ?approximately 19,000 men and women were actually attacked.This number is unbelievably and ?inexcusably high.The armed forces are supposed to represent a faction of our society that values honor and duty, but these ?numbers give a different impression about the culture that is actually being perpetuated within these institutions.In order to fight and protect in the hostile and often traumatizing ?situation of war, a certain mindset has to ?be nurtured in the minds of a soldier.It is this hypermasculinity and desire for control and power over others that leads one to be a competent warrior.However, these are also ?characteristics that often drive people toward sexual assault.It is the responsibility of the ?military to make sure these assaults are not being directed inward at their own ranks, resulting in the dehumanization, ?humiliation and demoralization of their fellows in arms.The most effective way to prevent this mindset from harming women (who are the most frequent, though not the only victims) is to put them in equal positions of power with men.Putting women in active combat ?allows men and women to establish a bond of survival, making it less likely that they will be viewed as inferior ?objects to be conquered.This change will also allow women to advance into positions of power, which will help to eliminate ideas of female ?inferiority.The editorial board is, of course, grateful to the armed forces for the services they provide for our country, but we are not blind to their faults or their crimes. Somebody has to take ?responsibility.While we regret the existence of these assaults, we are glad these crimes are ?recently becoming more visible, because that is the only way that they may be ?addressed and eradicated.',\n",

       "  'body': 'These past two days, Lyndsay Jones and Emily Smith spoke out openly, and everybody seemed to listen.The fact that these two women came forward without the veil of anonymity and addressed the complexities that shroud sexual assault in the manner they did matters a great deal. The bravery and selflessness demonstrated by these individuals is immeasurable. If sexual assault continues to only be discussed in anonymous terms and behind closed doors of IU administrators, law enforcement officials and politicians, it makes it all too easy to ignore this issue of epidemic proportions.Sexual assault is often difficult to quantify. The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 2 million women are the victims of sexual assault per year. And that’s just the women. The real figures are actually considerably higher because these crimes are so underreported.While there are countless statistics, studies and research that attempt to communicate the urgency of this issue, numbers are just that: numbers. Sexual assault on college campuses is not an issue we can begin to understand simply by looking at a spreadsheet. By reading and hearing these personal accounts, it helps us to establish a human connection and to understand that these issues are very real and very close to home.Another driving point behind our investigations series was the fact that IU is one of more than 50 institutions in the United States under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights. The schools on this list are being investigated for their handling of sexual violence and harassment cases and possible related violations. IU’s placement on the list, a DOE spokesperson told the Indiana Daily Student, is deliberate — contrary to University officials insisting that the review and list placement is random.It is the obligation of IU, and all universities for that matter, to be more transparent about what is being investigated and why.We wanted to take this opportunity to invite you to talk about your own experiences. Whether you have reported a sexual assault or not, we’d like to hear whatever you are ready to share.The thing is, this conversation didn’t end with the conclusion of our investigations series Tuesday.

       "  'body': 'As this semester ends, I find myself continually ?reflecting on a few things.The Indiana Daily Student published several pieces about student well-being and sexual violence on campus that were insightful but filled me with a sense of frustration and hopelessness.Even in my classes, people expressed anger. How can we continually let people suffer violence?What can we do to improve the quality of life for our students, and how can we discuss these issues?These were questions that were brought up again and again. Students were especially focused on sexual violence, given the recent University of Virginia debacle and reports of violence here at IU.I find myself looking less hopefully at legal intervention and justice.The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network has a whole section that walks victims through investigations and going to trial and court proceedings, and it is ?daunting.This is not to say that legal action is not necessary — it absolutely is.It allows people to look seriously at the issue. But more often than not, it simply doesn’t go in the victim’s favor.Instead, I find myself looking seriously and critically at the way the aftercare of victims is handled, especially here at IU. Currently, IU provides only 21 professionals at the Counseling and Psychological Services center to treat upward of 40,000 students, many of whom are dealing with the aftermath of?sexual violence.This is unacceptable.The Rape Treatment Center reports that more often than not, victims of violence do not report what happened to them for a variety of reasons — shame, depression, repression, shock, their emotional state, etc.Sexual violence is extremely personal and ?terrifying.It is hard, across the board, for victims to open up about such traumatic experiences.Suicide.org reports that only 39 percent of sexual assaults are reported to the police. RAINN reported the percentage could be as large as 60 percent.According to RAINN, 97 out of every 100 rapists will walk free.That means that, when looking at the bare numbers, 97 victims of sexual violence will have been failed by our justice system.And until that system changes, we need to have methods and funding in place to assist victims.The Sexual Assault Resource Center reports that the mental trauma victims might deal with after their assault can range from acute depression to post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts.Suicide.org reports that 33 percent of victims experience suicidal thoughts, and 13 percent of victims will attempt suicide.Counseling and Psychological Services barely has the resources to handle the students on campus who aren’t dealing with trauma on that scale.It is ridiculous of us to expect them to be able to handle the aftercare of sexual violence victims on campus, and it’s not because they don’t want to, it’s literally because they can’t.I demand that we fix this. Until we can properly address the legal course of action for victims, we need to provide proper care.IU needs to give CAPS more resources if our administration plans to properly combat campus sexual violence.Otherwise, it will all just be talk.ewenning@indiana.edu',\n",

Whether the fraternity had a social event on the books that night. Some other inconsistencies in Jackie’s story.My responses, in order: Why does this matter if it occurred at the fraternity and included other fraternity members?This is a reasonable misunderstanding.Why does this matter at all?Drew was a part of her assault.She saw him at the pool.Maybe she thought he was a lifeguard. Maybe he was and just wasn’t a member of that fraternity.As if every social event goes on the books. As if.But, maybe there was not a formal ?social event.People still might have been there drinking. Jackie’s post-trauma memory might have been so damaged by being raped that the details of whether or not there was a formal party might not have maintained their original clarity. In cases of severe sexual trauma, like Jackie’s, the details of the event can be incredibly traumatic to call back to memory.In order to protect oneself, survivors often subconsciously block out some parts or recreate different versions. Over time, it is completely possible for her story to have changed.My takeaway is that clearly something terrible happened and because of that we should stand with her.She would not have come forward unless something terrible and traumatic ?had happened.Doing anything other than supporting her is blatantly cruel.Questioning her or calling her “the girl who cried rape” retraumatizes her. It removes the focus from the perpetrators, from UVA’s lack of response to sexual assaults, from American universities’ lack of responses to sexual assaults.It fuels the fire of the false-rape myth.It makes it harder for people to believe other survivors, who also deserve to be believed.It discredits advocates’ work to bring this issue to national attention.So, I support Jackie, and you should too.Rachel GreenIU seniorrachgree@indiana.edu',\n",

There was blatant and unapologetic sexualization of women, an uncomfortable race joke, crude fetishizing of homosexuality, and scenes that repeatedly made light of sexual assault and sexual harassment.But I laughed.In “Horrible Bosses 2,” Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day return as their respective characters, Nick, Kurt and Dale.This time around, the trio is trying to become their own bosses .Their road to success is through a shower gadget they’ve developed.Things are looking good until a shady businessman, Burt Hanson, turns on them.Now their business is at risk. They’re going to lose rights to their invention, and they’re half a million in the hole.So what clever idea do our three heroes come up with to save the day?Kidnap Burt Hanson’s son, Rex.This plan leads the trio down a hilarious path, where we run into our old friends Motherfucker Jones, played by Jamie Foxx, and Dr. Julia Harris, played with uncomfortable menace by Jennifer Aniston.The only reason I’m not signing a petition to end screenwriter and director Sean Ander’s career is because the film was written so cleverly it would be ridiculous to be truly offended by “Horrible Bosses 2.”There’s a sense of sarcasm woven into the comedy that reassures you Anders and his producers aren’t condoning sexual assault or encouraging an audience to plot a kidnapping.Bateman, Sudeikis and Day make up a solid team with each of their individual comedy styles complementing the other two.Day’s over-the-top naivete would be hard to digest for 108 minutes without Bateman’s deadpan, emotionless delivery and Sudeikis’ spot-on jerk persona.While Bateman, Sudeikis and Day keeps the comedy strong, it was Chris Pine, as Rex Hanson, who steals the show.Pine steps out of his typical heartthrob, action hero role to show his crazy side — and not the reckless, witty kind of crazy we see in him as Captain Kirk.Pine’s performance as a raving lunatic is so solid it’s almost unnerving. And though his character is the initial antagonist, Pine makes him hard to hate.His performance further drives the point that “dramatic” actors have a place in comedy.“Horrible Bosses 2” is a cleverly written film with a great range of actors.It’s sure to press some buttons, but you’ll probably be laughing too much to care by the end.Lexia Banks',\n",

       "  'body': 'Lyndsay Jones’ first-person account is striking because of her willingness to share her story on the record with her name and photo. By talking openly about a subject that is normally cloaked in anonymity, she shines a light on difficult issues of sexual assault that are common across college campuses.Midway through her first semester on the Bloomington campus, she trusted a male friend — another student — who she says raped her in his apartment. After reporting the incident to the Bloomington Police Department, Lyndsay became so disillusioned with the attitude of the officers and detectives that she withdrew her complaint.When Lyndsay reported the sexual assault to the Office of Student Ethics, she wanted justice, she said. She was devastated when the hearing panel reached a decision of no finding, choosing not to discipline her alleged perpetrator.The man Lyndsay accuses of raping her is still an undergraduate student at IU.The issues raised by Lyndsay’s account are especially relevant now, when the U.S. Department of Education is investigating IU for its handling of sexual assault complaints.How is consent defined, by the University and by students? How qualified are the staff members who sit in judgment on these cases? How fair are IU’s ethics hearings and investigations, both to the accuser and the accused? Can the University provide the justice that Lyndsay and others seek?The questions at the heart of Lyndsay’s account cannot be ignored.***It is an especially important time to analyze the way IU handles sexual assaults. In May 2014, IU was revealed as one of more than 50 schools under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights for possible violations of Title IX, a federal law that in part dictates how universities should handle sexual misconduct complaints. Emily Springston, chief student welfare and Title IX officer, said IU was chosen randomly for the review, and there was not a specific complaint that led to the investigation.“My guess would be they’re trying to do a good cross section of different types of schools,” Springston said.However, a spokesperson from the U.S. Department of Education said these reviews are not random. While he did not share what specifically led to IU’s review, a spokesperson said these investigations can be initiated based on statistical data on sexual assaults, individual allegations and prior complaints filed to a university.Sexual assault is a complicated crime that is often under-reported. According to a White House Task Force report, one in five women will be sexually assaulted while on a college campus. If that projection is true at IU-Bloomington, with a female population of over 18,000, over 3,700 of those women will be a victim of sexual assault on IU’s campus.The University insists it takes the cases that reach them seriously. According to Office of Student Ethics records obtained by the Indiana Daily Student between July 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2013, 195 sexual misconduct cases were reported to the Office of Student Ethics, and 53 of those cases led to a hearing. Two cases resulted in deferred suspension of the accused, 20 ended in expulsion and 22 led to suspension.Nine cases, including Lyndsay’s, resulted in no finding against the accused.When making decisions on cases, the Office of Student Ethics rules based on a preponderance of the evidence presented. If 50.01 percent of the evidence shows the respondent is responsible, serious sanctions can be imposed on the student, said Jason Casares, assistant dean of students and director, deputy Title IX coordinator. However, when a student is not found responsible, like in Lyndsay’s case, no sanctions are imposed.“We’re not saying that nothing happened,” Casares said. “We just didn’t have enough information to meet the burden of proof.”Intensive interview processes are held with the respondent, the complainant and any witnesses. Panel members volunteer from different campus departments serve on hearing panels. Currently, 23 staff members from the Bloomington campus serve as panel members, more than half of whom work for Residential Programs and Services. The rest come from the Student Union, the Kelley School of Business, Student Life and Learning and Emergency Management and Continuity, as well as the Office of Student Ethics.In order to serve on these hearing panels, staff members must complete more than 50 hours of training, including reading material on sexual assault research and attending in-person seminars taught by professionals who work with sexual assault victims.This training is more comprehensive than the two-hour training mandated before 2011. That same year, the U.S. Department of Education issued a Dear Colleague letter to college administrations across the country, stating universities’ obligations in responding to sexual violence.Debbie Melloan, a licensed clinical social worker for IU Counseling and Psychological Services, has taught seminars at these training sessions. She said while training is important, human nature can still play a role in the decision-making process. If panel members have never been in situations where they have felt a loss of control, they could reach inaccurate conclusions, she said.“People tend to just react out of their own life experiences,” Melloan said.The University defines consent as an “agreement or permission expressed through affirmative, voluntary words or actions that are mutually understandable to all parties involved.” This means that a verbal “yes” clearly understood by both parties signifies consent. In cases lacking a verbal “yes,” Casares said there are some actions that could also express consent. He said panel members analyze these actions on a case-by-case basis.Melloan said she sees a great deal of miscommunication in these cases.“One person might assume that person is interested in them sexually without it ever being discussed,” she said.Melloan said it is typical for victims to freeze in the moment of their assault, as Lyndsay did. She said this frozen mentality usually comes when a victim is being assaulted in a situation where they thought they were safe, such as when the perpetrator is a friend.“They could be intimidated or too impaired to be able to speak up,” Melloan said. “That could stop them from saying ‘yes’ or ‘no.’”Problems with communication are not limited to consent. When Lyndsay initially reported a sexual assault, the police instructed her to respond casually to her alleged perpetrator if he ever reached out to her after the incident. The detective wanted to see if she could get him to admit any remorse for that night or indicate that he knew the sex was not consensual.While she continued talking to him, Lyndsay remembers almost longing for the friendship they had before the incident. This response is not uncommon, said Rene Henry, assistant director of the Student Advocates program. The trauma of a rape, Henry explains, can affect victims in unusual ways, and victims might feel like reaching out to their rapists to help them make sense of their assault.“Every person has their unique responses to what happens,” Henry said. “They’re all normal reactions to abnormal situations.”***Since the announcement of the Title IX investigation, IU has made strides to improve its platform on sexual assault awareness and prevention. But the University’s hearing process draws mixed reactions from people who work with victims.Toby Strout, executive director of Middle Way House, works with victims of sexual and domestic violence in the Bloomington community. Strout said many students she works with are unhappy with IU’s process. She often sees them leaving the campus system feeling tarnished.“They feel that they’re going to go through a long period of recovery, and that they end up carrying a burden from somebody else’s criminal intent,” she said.Jawn Bauer has worked on and off as a volunteer attorney for Middle Way House for nearly 25 years, providing legal consultation and representation for victims of sexual and domestic abuse. Bauer has found it is important to remain patient with clients to help them become comfortable enough to speak openly.“This is a person that has been traumatized, and you have to empathize with that,” Bauer said. “You have to understand that it may cause them problems in communication.”Strout said she does not believe the University should be hearing these cases. But she understands the University may have no choice.“The University operates more like a business,” she said. “It’s not in its best interest to make it clear how much sexual assault there is on campus. For that reason, they should take people out of the process for whom that’s going to be paramount.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'In a private room within the Office of Student Ethics, Rachel relived the moments when she was raped in a campus fraternity house.Across a study table from her, an investigator sat and monitored Rachel while she read the contents of a disciplinary file that included a personal statement about the encounter from her rapist.She could only get through one sentence of the man’s account before closing the file and pushing it back across the table, too angry to finish.Rachel, now an IU junior, was sexually assaulted her freshman year and decided to pursue a sexual misconduct hearing through the IU Office of Student Ethics. She spoke to the IDS and asked that she only be identified by her first name because her rapist returned to campus this year after being suspended.Several times before the hearing, she reviewed materials in a judicial file that collected all the information from the investigation. Rachel wanted a chance to read the personal statements in the comfort of her home, without supervision. She wanted to discuss the information openly during a phone call to her sister for advice.“I just honestly didn’t want to read it there,” Rachel said. “It was just super uncomfortable for me, and that’s something I would’ve rather read in private.”But the office staff couldn’t let her take a copy home with her. An IU policy prohibits students — including those who report or are accused of sexual assault — from obtaining copies or taking photos of disciplinary files that include identifying information about other students. Rachel could only look at the judicial file for her own case during certain hours of the day and under supervision in the Office of Student Ethics.IU’s policy is in line with that of other universities and follows federal law on the curation of student records, but some sexual assault victims say the policy works against them.Students such as Rachel and Jen Miller, a 33-year-old IU student who was sexually assaulted three and a half years ago, said restricted file access costs them closure and could re-traumatize some victims by only allowing them to work through the information under supervision.Though this policy is meant to protect students’ privacy, it means victims no longer have control over their own information. Once a sexual assault is reported to the Office of Student Ethics, that information effectively belongs to IU, not the student who submitted the complaint, Associate Dean of Students Jason Casares said.Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), federally funded universities such as IU are required to allow students access to their education records — including disciplinary records — to inspect and correct errors in the materials.“Under FERPA, a school must provide an eligible student with an opportunity to inspect and review his or her education records within 45 days following its receipt of a request,” according to the most updated FERPA guidance from the U.S. Department of Education’s website.“A school is required to provide a student with copies of education records, or to make other arrangements, if a failure to do so would effectively prevent the student from obtaining access to the records. A case in point would be a situation in which the student does not live within commuting distance of the school,” the guidance states.Aimee Burkert Oestreich, assistant general counsel at IU, said the University would not mail a copy of the student records but would opt to make other arrangements. She said she could not give an example for privacy reasons.“The University would evaluate what other arrangements may be appropriate on a case-by-case basis as such arrangements would be case-specific,” Burkert Oestreich said in an email. “Accordingly, we cannot effectively speculate about an example.”For misconduct complaints, the IU Office of Student Ethics keeps a centralized judicial file, which includes all information generated from the original complaint to the final decision at a campus judicial hearing. A judicial file might include the original complaint of misconduct, personal statements from the complainant and defendant and sometimes police reports, if the alleged victim reported their assault to law enforcement, as well. If a victim had a rape kit done, hospital and medical records may be included, then removed after the campus judicial hearing — again, to protect student privacy.Rachel’s file included statements from her attacker and the witnesses he called for the hearing. When she read through her file in the office room, she would skim through any new information and hand it back so the staff member supervising her could leave.“They say take as much time as you want to read your stuff, but with everyone sitting in there, you feel bad taking up their time,” she said. “I would feel them standing near me, eager for me to be done.”The day before the hearing, a nervous Rachel called her sister about the investigation. But without her file with her at home, she would forget details included in the materials, which left her feeling less prepared for the hearing.During the hearing, Rachel felt as though she was hearing the information for the first time. She felt blindsided and frustrated, she said.Both the alleged victim and the alleged perpetrator, referred to as the complainant and respondent, respectively, can review the judicial file related to their case as the misconduct investigation progresses, Casares said.They can take notes and are allowed to inspect the file with an advocate, but they can’t make copies or take photos. Office staff are assigned to supervise each student to make sure no one removes or copies parts of the file.“IU has a responsibility to protect the privacy of all those involved in a student judicial proceeding, not just the individual who has filed the complaint,” IU spokesperson Mark Land said in an email.IU’s policy means a limited number of people can access private information related to the judicial proceedings, Land said, and those people can’t make copies.Casares said the two students involved have equal opportunities to inspect their files.“Everybody has the same access to the same information,” Casares said.IU isn’t the only university to have this policy. Ohio State University only allows files outside its Office of Student Conduct if the files are subpoenaed — a policy that is legal under FERPA. Even then, information that could identify students outside the scope of that investigation is redacted by OSU’s legal team. Ball State University does the same.One exception is the University of Michigan, which allows students to take copies out of the office at any time, spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said in an email.The Bloomington Police Department has procedures similar to IU. Investigatory records are not available for public access in Indiana, and BPD considers sexual assault victims as members of the general public under this rule. They are not able to see their full case file during or after the investigation, said Joan Manning, BPD Records Division Supervisor.Manning said BPD generally evaluates requests on a case-by-case basis. Victims can sit down with an officer and look at a file, but they can’t remove files or request copies of full case reports.This is an institutionalized policy that has become common for the way sexual assault investigations are carried out in university and criminal settings.Jen Miller, who was involved with an IU sexual assault support group for more than a year, agreed with Rachel that privacy is important when victims of sexual assault review their information.She said allowing victims to look at investigation materials on their own time could be better for their peace of mind.“Someone who has recently been through the trauma of an assault may not be in the mindset to sit down and copy by hand the relevant information in the files,” Miller said. “If she could obtain an electronic copy, that would be far less re-traumatizing than having to read every word and write it down.”Frank LoMonte, executive director of the Student Press Law Center, told the IDS there’s legally no difference between allowing a student to inspect their judicial file on-site and allowing them to take a copy home.“The Department of Education has been asked whether a student can make copies even if there is no obstacle to the student reviewing the records on-site, and the Department’s answer was yes, a student has that right,” LoMonte said.Miller said not allowing victims access to copies of the paperwork creates barriers to self-advocacy and defense.“Not only does this prevent a victim from actively participating in her hearing at IU, if she decides later to pursue criminal charges outside of the university, she is less prepared to do so,” Miller said.Margaux Janda, a former IU student whose complaint against the University over the short disciplinary sanction for her rapist made national news in 2010, tried to request her file at the IDS’ request but did not receive a reply from the Office of Student Ethics after three calls.Casares has previously said students who aren’t in commuting distance of the university, such as Janda, would not be able to receive a personal copy of their case file. Instead they would have to make other arrangements to review their file. Distance is not an exception to the University policy.Janda said she sees the policy as a restriction on complainants and respondents so the University can avoid litigation. After the results of her hearing and subsequent appeals, for which her rapist was sanctioned with one year’s suspension, she and her parents filed a request with the federal Office of Civil Rights to investigate IU for a possible Title IX violation.“The more victims with their judicial files, the more opportunities for lawyers, litigators and advocates to review those files, judgments and injustices,” she said in an email. “The more documents out there ... the more opportunities for victims, parents and even attorneys to find legal standing against the university.”Though her complaint went to a campus judicial hearing in 2006, before Casares or Land worked at IU, the same policies regarding student record access were in place.“Honestly, I believe both claimants and respondents, regardless of guilt, should be furnished with a copy of their files without even asking,” Janda said. “It should be standard procedure. That way if a defendant is in fact innocent, they are then afforded the same opportunity to review the facts, correct the record ... or seek legal counsel.”Though she has problems with IU’s policy, Rachel said office staff were helpful and tried to make her more comfortable. She acknowledges it’s hard to balance protecting student privacy and a victim’s comfort.“It’s a sticky situation,” she said. “There’s no easy way to do that.”After Rachel was assaulted, she wrote letters to her attacker. She never sent them, she said — her therapist suggested writing them to help her cope with her feelings.When she re-read them recently, two years after she was assaulted, Rachel realized she forgot how traumatized she was at the time. She said sometimes she thinks she made too much of the incident, that her attacker was really a nice guy.“Now I remember he ruined my freshman year,” she said.A copy of her file, Rachel said, could give her a sense of closure just like the letters did.“If I had those files, maybe I could remember what I would feel like,” she said. “Even though it’s not something I want to remember ... you should remember how it affected you.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"Editor's note: This is the concluding installment of the Indiana Daily Student’s investigative series delving into sexual assault at IU. The first part of this series brought you into the gray zone — exploring the vast complexities when it comes to reporting these events and the experience of one woman as she attempted to bring her case through the legal system. In these final stories, we take you through the system at the University meant to protect its students. But is it working? Fairness. Dignity. Integrity.I stared at the words printed on the wall in front of me. I was in the hearing room in the Office of Student Ethics. To my left sat the first friend I’d made since moving to Bloomington that fall — the man who, several weeks after I met him, raped me.This hearing would determine whether IU would hold him responsible. I wanted him suspended or expelled. We sat at the same table but were separated by a divider that prevented us from seeing each other. Three panelists who would decide the case sat across from us.He was there to make the case that the sex between us was consensual. I was there because it wasn’t.I read my statement.“I am here because I was involved in sexual activity against my will. I am here because I have been greatly wronged, and I live with the consequences of that every day. But I should not be the only one burdened with the consequences of such actions.”I looked across the table at the panelists and searched their faces for understanding. But the room was silent, and I saw nothing.***Above all else, I am a writer. So when trying to make sense of what happened, I turned to what I knew best. When I started writing this piece eight months ago, I was a reporter at the Indiana Daily Student. This fall semester, I took a break from school and plan to return in January.I knew it would be difficult to share my name, and at first I was reluctant to be photographed, but it’s worth it. By going public, I can give depth and credibility to an issue usually shrouded in anonymity.I am not afraid to tell my story. I have nothing to hide.My first few weeks at IU, in early fall 2013, were a blur of loneliness. I met the man two weeks into the semester at a call-out meeting for a campus group. Like me, he was a transfer student. He was 25. I was 21. We shared a sarcastic sense of humor. I welcomed his company.The suddenness of our friendship made me question what had started. He was flirtatious at times, but I reminded him I had a long-distance boyfriend. I wasn’t looking for anything — or anyone — else.I texted him one night to ask about his intentions.“My goal,” he said, “is not to fuck you.”A month or so after meeting him, I went to his apartment. It was a Sunday night after work, and he had asked me to come over. He wasn’t doing much, he said, just homework and watching “The Walking Dead.”I was already at home. I had just showered and put on a tank top and my monkey-print pajama pants for the night. But I wanted company, so I drove over. I didn’t change my clothes because we were just going to hang out.So we sat on his couch talking — about everything and nothing, how my job as a delivery driver was horrible, how stupid his assignments were in one of his classes. Then he changed the subject.“You like it when people cut the bullshit and get to the point, don’t you?”I laughed. “Yeah,” I said.He said it again. “When people cut the bullshit and get to the point.”The smile I’d been wearing glazed.He stood up and leaned over me as he put his hands on either side of the couch. His arms walled me in. Suddenly he kissed me.“What are you doing?” I asked. He looked at me.“You knew if you came here, this would happen,” he said. He looked supremely confident.He asked me to make out with him a little more. His week, he said, had been stressful, and he needed it. That was all I would have to do.“OK.” I didn’t want to, but I supposed I could — if it would get me out of there. Besides, he had told me before that he had anger issues as a young adult. I didn’t want to upset him.“Go to the bedroom,” he said.This change of scenery seemed excessive for people who were “just going to make out for a few minutes.” But I trusted him, so I went and he followed.For a while, everything went as he had said. There was only kissing. But after a few minutes, he paused. “Can you have sex?”He knew I had a boyfriend. The question was a request for consent.“I can’t have sex with you,” I told him. I said it a few more times. He remained unfazed.“Here’s what we’re going to do,” he said. “I’m going to give you a turn of oral, then you’re going to give me a turn.”I didn’t answer. I had just said I couldn’t have sex with him. It didn’t make sense that this was still happening.So I froze. Physically. Mentally. For a while, I couldn’t speak. I wanted to run out of the room, but I was too afraid of what would happen if I did.He suddenly bit me during oral sex, hard enough that I yelled.“You liked that,” he said. Later, he bit my nipple.In return for the oral he gave me, he told me to do the same to him. But as I prepared to go down on him, he suddenly got much closer. He started going inside of me. The situation seemed out of my control. I did nothing to stop it because I didn’t know what to do. I just wanted it to end.“This was your fault,” he announced. “You were on top of me, and I just couldn’t control myself.”Chapter 2Almost immediately after he finished, I ran to my car. My hands trembled as I texted my friend David.“What is rape?” I typed. “Like, do you have to be screaming and fighting the whole time?”When David met me at my apartment, I began to cry. Then I laughed to keep from crying. Crying made me feel weak.Although I was incapable of telling a coherent story, David heard enough to confirm I’d been raped. He wanted me to call the police, but I wasn’t ready.David said he was going to step outside for a cigarette. When he came back in, we didn’t speak. Ten, maybe 15 minutes had passed when I heard steps thumping up the stairs.The Bloomington Police Department had sent two men to my apartment.They began asking basic questions. What happened, who was involved, what time was it?Then one of the police officers asked me if I had ever been attracted to the man. In that moment, I didn’t know. But what did it matter?“I don’t know, maybe,” I said. “I didn’t want to have sex with him tonight, if that’s what you mean.”“I’m just trying to figure out if a crime was committed,” the officer said.The two officers stepped outside to talk. I sat in a corner, my knees to my chest, thinking I could never be so humiliated again.When the officers came back inside, they stood by the door.“If you think you were raped, you need to go the hospital,” one said.If you think you were raped. The words rang of disbelief.***At the hospital, I went through another round of police questioning. My patience was thinning.“Look, I need you to communicate with me,” a new officer said. “If you don’t tell me anything else, I can’t help you.”I chose to open an investigation, so when the uniformed officers finished questioning me, they called in a detective. It would be about 45 minutes before he arrived. In the meantime, a nurse began asking questions for the rape kit.Each question referred to a different part of the body and a different action. For each one, the nurse said the name of the friend who had forced himself on me. I was hearing it over and over again.Did he bite, suck or grab my breasts? Did he bite or suck my labia?Eventually, the detective arrived.“If I seem a little out of it, it’s because I was in bed,” he said.He was apologizing, but I was offended.“Sorry to have dragged you out here,” I said.He took my story and then asked if I wanted him to pursue a criminal investigation. Theoretically, it seemed like a good idea. But now I was starting to understand how exhausting it would be.If he was put in jail, what would he do if he got out? I imagined he would be livid. The possibility was frightening.I told the detective I had changed my mind about pressing charges. I made excuses. The detective told me he would close the case and left. I continued with the rape kit.I held up a paper with my name and patient information for a camera while the nurse snapped my picture. Another nurse undergoing training stood near, observing and stepping in when needed.I peed in a cup and took a pregnancy test. The nurse asked me to swab the inside of my cheeks and gums for the man’s DNA and run a piece of plastic under my fingernails to search for traces of his skin. She told me to take off my clothes and stand on a piece of paper to catch any of the man’s DNA that fell off me.The nurse and her trainee turned off the lights and shined a UV light over my skin. They searched every inch of my body for the glow of semen. When they found some on my legs, they took samples with cotton swabs.When this part was over, I laid down on an exam bed for the vaginal exam. The nurse inserted a speculum into my vagina. She said she was going to press on my cervix and that it might be a little painful. She pressed harder and harder until I finally cried out.***He started to call me every day. When I didn’t pick up the phone, he texted. He wanted to see me again.He hadn’t reached out to me so frequently before. I couldn’t understand it. I asked my counselor, a sexual assault specialist, why this was happening. She told me his behavior was typical for a rapist.“He wants to control the information you have,” the counselor said. She suggested getting a no-contact order from the Office of Student Ethics.I had made up my own explanations for why he was reaching out to me with such urgency. Maybe he liked me and had wanted a relationship. The thought made me feel guilty.I wanted more than anything to pick up the phone and find out why he had done this to me. I wanted to understand why I missed him when I hoped to never see him again. But I knew talking to him wouldn’t help me make sense of anything. So I ignored him.This was successful until I ran into him one day. I was at Baja Fresh in the Indiana Memorial Union, ordering quesadillas, when he joined the line. We spoke briefly. About what, I can’t remember. I was preoccupied with seeming normal but failed miserably. While he waited for his food, I shuffled away. He ate with another girl, and when he finished, he came over and sat in the chair across from me.“So,” he said, without any lightness in his tone, “tell me the real reason you got all weird on me.”I felt his anger, the heat of it, radiating from his body to mine. Eventually, I shrugged.“I don’t ... I don’t know.”He stood, and the chair skidded back from him. When he was gone, I fled to the Office of Student Ethics.Later, the student ethics office issued the no-contact order against the man and began looking into the case. Because I was reporting a sexual assault by another IU student, a three-person panel would hold a sort of “trial” to determine if disciplinary action was necessary. As the complainant, it was my job to offer enough evidence to prove that my story was true.Chapter 3The hearing was that December, during finals week. The two of us took our seats on either side of the divider. My skin crawled every time I heard him shift in his chair or speak aloud.We sat across from Jason Casares, the associate dean of students, as well as two other IU staff members, both women. Everyone had copies of the information that had been gathered — my medical reports, notes taken from phone calls and in-office meetings, our written statements. My typed statement in the file was roughly two pages. His statement was in pencil, one paragraph on wide rule paper.Amber Monroe, the investigator assigned to the case, had written a summary of her first call to the man I’d accused. Immediately after introducing herself, she said, the man had begun cursing at her. Minutes later, he apologized and said he was a veteran.Casares explained how the hearing would unfold. I could give an opening statement. The panel would question me. Any witnesses I had would come into the room and make statements. The panel would question them. Then the accused would have his turn.“Sexual consent,” I said, reading from my statement, “is defined as being a direct verbal confirmation — a voluntary yes — and something that can be described as active and enthusiastic.”I had never given consent, I told the panelists. They asked why I went to his apartment. They asked how my nipple had been bitten. Had I taken off my shirt voluntarily, or did he remove it? I told them he had rolled up the shirt.I didn’t really understand how these questions made a difference.When we came back, David, my only witness, had arrived.“I knew something was really wrong,” he said, describing my behavior that night. “She kept acting like ... like a cornered animal.”The accused made his statement next.“I thought Lyndsay was a beautiful, intelligent girl, and I saw sex as a natural progression toward a relationship,” he said.For a moment, I almost believed him. I had the urge to rush over and hug him, to say I was sorry. But there was a catch. People don’t rape people they like.The thought of saying sorry or hugging him vanished. In fact, the thought repulsed me.“Why did you invite her over to begin with?” Casares said.“I wanted to kiss her,” he said.Casares had told me he was going to try to generate a reaction from the accused that would “break him.” Now Casares asked him if his time as an Army Ranger might sometimes make him come across as forceful or demanding.“There was no way my words could have come across as demanding,” he said.Casares asked him if he had noticed any hesitancy from me. At first, the man said no. He said our sex was as comfortable as “between husband and wife.” But eventually, he admitted he had noticed my reluctance. Twice.“Everyone is hesitant when they have sex with a new person, though.”Soon it was time for closing statements.I told the panel, once again, that I was looking for a suspension based on IU’s standard of consent.“Sexual consent is defined as a verbal yes. In this hearing, neither side has testified that I said yes, because I didn’t.”Two weeks later, I was called to the ethics office to learn the panelists’ unanimous decision: “no finding.”“I know this may not be what you wanted, but we just didn’t think there was enough evidence to determine what happened,” Casares said. “I really did try to break him, but I couldn’t.”I appealed and was granted a second hearing during the spring semester. A new trio of panelists listened to the recording of the first hearing and read the documents.When the office called with the ruling, I couldn’t bring myself to pick up the phone. A voice mail told me the news.Another no finding.Two months later, I stood at an X-bus stop near the Indiana Memorial Union as I waited for the ride back home. I was listening to a Fall Out Boy song when I saw my rapist.He was unshaven and his hair was longer, so it took me a second to register who he was. He was walking up to the bus stop with a friend who’d been his witness at the hearing.When he saw me, I froze again. I locked eyes with him and waited for him to break the gaze. He stopped speaking abruptly, then told his friend, “Keep going.”I assumed he and his friend would wait for the next bus, because he was under a no-contact order. But to my surprise, they got on the bus. I sat in the back, and he stood up front. I stared at him. He never looked back. The whole bus ride I shook and burned with anger. He was standing there, not doing anything to me, but doing everything all over again and getting away with it.When we came to my stop, I was one of the first out the middle door.As the bus pulled away, we walked in opposite directions. When I turned around, he was looking at me, watching me walk home.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Together, we know a lot of victims of rape and sexual assault.Curiously, none of us seem to know any rapists.Considering sexual assault is a problem that conservatively affects about 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men — an estimate of almost 24 million Americans in total — it’s odd that we don’t know any of the ?perpetrators.But the archetypal rapist is almost created to be someone we couldn’t know.He’s ugly.He’s friendless.Cruelly sadistic, completely ?unsociable.Likely in and out of jail.He’s a straw man those who do commit sexual assault can easily hold up and say, “look, guys, that isn’t me.”According to a 2002 study by David Lisak of the University of Massachusetts in Boston, and Paul Miller of the Brown University School of Medicine, about 6 percent of college men surveyed — 1 in 17 — are rapists.This study might not be representative of college men nationally, but it does give an indication of how ?widespread the problem can be.Women do commit sexual assault, but it is comparatively rare. Nearly 98 percent of all sexual assaults are committed by men, according to a report by the White House Council for Women and Girls published in January 2014.Who lurks behind the straw man?They can be attractive.Often, they have a consenting sexual partner. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 22 percent of incarcerated rapists are married.After all, rape isn’t really about sex, it’s about power. Compared to men who do not rape, those who do are often motivated by a need to dominate, in part to reaffirm their hyper-masculine attitudes and ?beliefs.They can be your friends.A 2005 DOJ study indicates that 73 percent of assailants are known to the victim. Of these, 38 percent are a friend or acquaintance, 28 percent are an intimate partner and 7 percent are a relative. Maybe we just know them from class. Maybe we only ever see them at parties. Maybe we live with them. Maybe we talk to them every day. If 1 in 17 college men has committed a sexual assault, this is a ?statistical inevitability.They can be calculating.Taken together, 76 of the admitted rapists in Lisak and Miller’s study enacted 439 attempted or completed rapes, averaging 5.8 assaults each. These men made up 4 percent of the entire sample. Following this data, the overwhelming majority of men are not rapists, but most rapists are serial rapists.In a paper about these serial “undetected rapists,” Lisak concludes that they are strategic in their selection and grooming of potential victims. They only use enough violence to be successfully coercive and rarely resort to actual weapons. Instead, they use abusive psychology and alcohol to weaken their victims.They’re running free.An estimated 60 percent of rapes are never reported, according to DOJ data collected between 2008 and 2012. Of those reported, only 10 percent lead to a successful felony conviction. Even fewer lead to any prison time at all.These data paint a bleak picture, but they’re not insurmountable. Though administrative and legal changes could help, simple ?behavioral changes can too.Stop treating women like ?objects.The phrase “hit it and quit it” literally refers to your sexual partner as a thing, not a person. So does the word “target.” Reexamine party themes that denigrate women, like the various iterations of “men and a not-so-clever pun on hoes” parties.Be more accepting.LGBT-identified people experience higher rates of sexual assault, in part because they are still marginalized by society at large. Transgender people are particularly vulnerable. Sixty-four percent of trans people have experienced sexual assault in their lifetimes, according to the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Sometimes these assaults are a manifestation of hate toward ?LGBT-identified people.Don’t haze.Sometimes hazing is simply a euphemism for socially-sanctioned sexual assault. IU ?fraternities and sororities are officially banned from hazing and have actively organized against ?the practice.Reject current norms of ?masculinity.Social standards of masculinity are too-often divorced from what real men are or want to be. Pinning one’s manhood on heterosexual success is not only homophobic, it discourages male victims of rape from reporting. Male rapists are also more likely to adhere to a standard of ?hyper-masculinity.Don’t laugh at rape jokes.Jokes targeting victims of rape — most often women and prisoners — aren’t funny, they’re threatening. Laughing at rape jokes tells any “undetected rapists” in your vicinity that rape is no big deal. It tells rape victims that their trauma is ?laughable.Keep people safe.At parties, help make sure everyone gets home safely. Find ways to take care of anyone who might have had too much to drink. In the same way you would take away a drunken person’s keys so they wouldn’t drive, try to safely step in when you think someone might be too drunk to consent.Believe victims.At some point in your college career, one of your friends might disclose to you they were raped. It is true that sometimes people make false claims, but the number of real sexual assaults far outstrips imagined ones. As a friend, your default should be to believe.Shun rapists.Your friend might also disclose the identity of their attacker, who could be someone you know. Stop hanging out with this person. Stop inviting them to parties where they might prey on other people you know. At the very least, avoid inviting the victim and the ?accused to the same event.Call out anyone contributing to rape culture.All of the above are recommendations to combat rape culture, or societal acceptance of the attitudes that make rapists think what they’re doing is OK. We’re not being overly politically correct. As long as so many of our peers are raped at IU every year, we’re being practical.',\n",

       "  'body': 'This will be my last ?column of the semester.I thought I would end with a somewhat alarming, somewhat conspiratorial thought I have on the state of our world.There is no doubt that this year has been ?eventful.To name just a few: We have seen the creation or attempted creation of a radical terrorist state in the Middle East; the discussion of sexual assault has rightly been placed more prominently in the sphere of public view; and there is undoubted racial tension within the United States and a corresponding civil rights energy.Our beloved, or formerly beloved, Bill Cosby is front and center a mile deep in rape accusations; Ukraine essentially dissolved as a nation overnight only to be reborn and pit Putin’s Russia against the West; our very own University has dealt with the loss of life; and scandal after scandal has plagued almost every area of public life. It sadly goes on and on.There are those who say things are worse than they have ever been.They preach a nostalgia for “better times” that is understandably tempting and alluring. They certainly do not lack evidence, at least for the problems of this current age.I am not sure if things are actually worse, and in fact I doubt it is even possible to know such a thing.But I do know ?something.I do know that even if the unrest, for lack of a better word, is the same as it has been, how we perceive it seems to be quite different.We appear to forget and to miss the person behind the events.For example, when we are confronted with someone who has done something horrible, we immediately jump to analyze and dissect the web of causations that entangle us all.We look for the psychological answers, the socioeconomic reasons, the perpetrator’s emotional state and his family life.These are all good things and they tell us plenty about some of the factors that influence people, but they don’t tell the whole picture. Sadly, and I firmly believe this, people sometimes simply do what is wrong.People are imperfect — they make mistakes. And sadly, sometimes those mistakes are awful.Sometimes they hurt people, and they hurt society — they have no excuse and they have little reason for what they do, but they still do it.As pessimistic as that sounds, I truly think coming to terms with this harsh reality is the only way to combat it.My hope — it may be a fool’s hope — is that this upcoming New Year will be different and we will make progress in alleviating some of the problems we are faced with.But I believe this is only possible if we stop trying to explain and start trying to heal — if we stop looking for all the reasons and start looking for the ?person.cgerst@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'For the past four months, the investigations team has been reporting on sexual assault as part of the Indiana Daily Student’s ongoing commitment to provide a deeper understanding about this complex issue. The IDS requested hundreds of police and university records and interviewed administrators, nurses, detectives, attorneys, advocates and experts to provide comprehensive accounts of the stories you’ll read in this series.In today’s paper and Tuesday’s, you will hear from two women who agreed to step forward, without a veil of anonymity, to share their stories.Today, you’ll meet Emily Smith, an IU senior. The IDS verified case information with available police report summaries, interviews with involved parties and correspondence with law enforcement. The reporters spoke with the two men who were accused of rape in both of these cases. However, because they opted not to be identified on the record, we have limited their accounts to information we could verify through other ?records and testimonies.There’s a problem on college campuses, and students across the country have cried out for change. We challenge you to take a hard look at our reporting and what’s happening around you and start talking.Michael Majchrowicz, Editor-in-Chiefeditor@idsnews.comHours are missing from her memory of that Saturday night.It was Sept. 28, 2013, and Emily Smith was starting her first semester as an IU senior. She can still recall the beginning of that evening, when she put on her favorite blue chiffon shirt before heading out to the bars with her roommate. She can still hear the loud music pulsing from the dance floor at Kilroy’s Dunnkirk. She remembers sharing drinks with her roommate and other friends.Then it all went black.When she came to several hours later, a man was moving on top of her, having sex with her in her own bed. She froze. Somewhere in the darkness, she could hear her phone vibrating. She wanted to answer it, but her hands were so numb she could not move them. Then she lost consciousness again.***When Emily, 22, woke the next morning, the man was still in her bed. She recognized his face from seeing him on a couple other nights at Dunnkirk, but she had only fleeting conversations with him and knew nothing about him. Even though she couldn’t remember what happened between them during the missing hours at the bar, one thing was clear to her that morning: she had been violated. Yet the man acted like nothing was wrong.One year later, Emily has decided to share her story in the Indiana Daily Student. By allowing readers to know her name and see her face, she said she hopes to show others that what happened to her could happen to anyone.When the IDS contacted the man for his version of that night, he declined to speak on the record and asked not to be identified other than by his first name, Phil. Now 24, he lives outside Bloomington and has never been an IU student. Phil said he had no idea that Emily was as impaired that night as she describes. He said the sex was consensual.The night after the incident, Emily reported a sexual assault to the Bloomington Police Department. For months, she worked with police to piece together what had happened and to provide any evidence showing that she had been unable to give consent.When talking about rape, most people long for the clarity of a stranger jumping out of the bushes with a knife. But the majority of rapes are committed by someone the victim knows, in situations that aren’t so black and white. This makes it much more confusing for the victim and much harder to prove in court.“It’s not stranger danger,” Emily said. “It’s your neighbor. It’s your friend. It’s the cute guy you met at the party who you’re really hitting it off with.”Her case, like so many others, unfolded in a gray zone — a tangle of missing memories, mixed signals and unclear intentions.Darcie Fawcett, the sex crimes deputy prosecuting attorney for Monroe County, evaluates all cases of reported sexual assault submitted for prosecution. Having reviewed Emily’s case, Fawcett said she believes Emily was in fact raped. But the prosecutor understood that believing is not the same as proving something to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Ultimately, she decided not to charge the man in Emily’s case.Emily was devastated. As it turns out, the outcome of her case is extremely common in Monroe County.General ScriptAccording to public records supplied by police and prosecutors, 712 cases of alleged rape, sexual battery and other sexual assaults were reported to the Bloomington and IU police departments between January 2008 and early November 2014.Of those cases, only 58 — about 8 percent — led to criminal charges.Emily’s story is worth telling not because it is extraordinary but because it is so typical. Her account is a case study in how difficult it is to prove sexual assault.Her rape, Emily said, was confusing, shameful and traumatic. But what happened next was an ordeal in and of itself. Over and over, she uses one phrase to describe what it was like to report a sexual assault and take her case into the criminal justice system.“It’s a clusterfuck.”Chapter 2On the night in question, Emily and her roommate, Jessica, made plans to go out with some girlfriends. Before heading out to the bars, they did their makeup and snapped a couple of photos together.Jessica, now a high school teacher, was also interviewed by the IDS and asked that she only be identified by her first name.The group of friends went to a concert at Kilroy’s Dunnkirk bar on Kirkwood Avenue. They were in a roped-off VIP section, where a table was set up with open bottles and a chaser for VIP members to pour their own drinks. At some point, Jessica and Emily set down their drinks briefly and walked away.Emily remembers leaning over a railing with her roommate, surrounded by her friends, feeling almost invincible. Until that point, she said, she’d had no more than four drinks.The next thing she remembered was waking up hours later with the man’s body looming over hers as he went inside of her. She didn’t know where they were at first or how they got there. She felt dizzy, frozen and entirely out of control.The rest of her night is gone from her memory, until she woke the next morning. The man kept inching closer telling her he wanted to have sex again.“I don’t know, I’m feeling sore,” Emily mumbled. She felt powerless, she said.She didn’t know what to do or say. Letting him do it again seemed the easiest way to get him to leave.“I try not to judge myself for what I did,” she said in retrospect. “He had already taken so much from me the night before.”She recognized the man. She and her friends sometimes would see him kissing the drunkest girls at Dunnkirk. Emily and her friends even had a nickname for him: The Predator.There had been times in the past when Emily had regretted sleeping with someone, she said. But the violation she felt that morning was much more than just regret. When she woke the second time, her clothes smelled like urine. Phil told her she had thrown up.Before he left, Emily asked him for his name and phone number. If she decided to press charges, she said, she would need to know how to reach him.***Something had happened that night to both Emily and her roommate. During Emily’s missing hours, Jessica had been found passed out in the bathroom at a different bar, covered in vomit. The two young women had both blacked out for the same period of time.The two roommates agreed that there was no way either of them would have blacked out from just three or four drinks. As college seniors and former resident assistants in dorms, Emily and Jessica had learned how to keep careful track of their drinking.Even if she had been having a casual hook-up, Emily would have only gone home with someone she knew well enough to make her feel respected. This man had no idea that she was usually quite shy and that she had only had about three boyfriends in her life, that she prided herself in being independent and maintaining control, all of which she said had been taken from her that night.Jessica called the Bloomington police to report that she and Emily had possibly been drugged. A patrol officer came to their apartment, and Emily sat in a chair in the farthest corner from him.Emily was not afraid of police officers. At the time, she was even training to apply for the Indiana State Police. But in this moment, she felt exposed.As the officer asked his questions, Emily found his tone insensitive. At one point, she remembers, he looked at Emily and asked, “Was anyone assaulted?”She couldn’t bring herself to say it out loud. Everything seemed clouded. She wondered if she had done something wrong.“No,” she said.To Emily, the cop didn’t seem to believe that she had been drugged. Why would he believe that she had been raped? How could she possibly tell this stranger such invasive details?“Had he said it a different way,” Emily recalled, “I probably would have felt more safe.”Darcie Fawcett, the sex crimes prosecutor, explained that the quality of a victim’s first interaction with police is the greatest predictor of his or her willingness to file a criminal case. The BPD said it could not comment on Emily’s case. But a detective sergeant acknowledged that their patrol officers do not specialize in investigating sexual assault and are far more likely to be men than women. Only 11 out of 94 sworn personnel for BPD are women.A patrol officer’s job is to get a statement and hand it off to a supervisor or detective.But the minute Emily answered “No,” she made her case much harder to prosecute.Chapter 3That afternoon, Emily went to the IU Health Bloomington Hospital Emergency Department so her urine could be tested for date rape drugs. But by the time Emily took the test, more than 12 hours after she might have been drugged, it was probably too late to get positive results.This, too, is common. Because so many women given date rape drugs experience a blackout, it’s often difficult to piece together what’s happened. By the time they realize, it’s typically too late.After taking the test, Emily was informed that the results were negative.Searching for answers about her night, Emily decided to text Phil. A transcript of their texts was later saved in the case file.“Still trying to piece together last night,” she wrote. “lol so I threw up? We met dancing?”“Yes and yes,” Phil answered.“Was my roommate with me?”“Yes for a while then she got too drunk somewhere.”“Huh? We think we might have been drugged,” Emily texted him. “I remember almost nothing before we had sex.”“Also we probably shouldn’t have hooked up if I was that out of it.”“Yeah probably.”“Were you drunk at all?” she asked.“A lil but not wasted I had a couple in me.”“Well I may have been hitting on you but I was not in any kind of state to make decisions,” she said.“Now I feel bad about my own decision making,” Phil said.“Yeah I’m not making any accusations but if that happened with someone else you could get in real trouble if they wanted to report it,” Emily responded. “Just be careful.”***After the tests, Emily sat in her apartment for hours, stewing over the fears filling her mind. She felt physical pain and wondered if something had gone wrong.Later that night, she went back to the Emergency Department to request a rape kit. The sexual assault nurse examiner ushered her to the same room as every other patient who reports a rape — Room 19. The nurse gave Emily a morning-after pill and a series of injections and pills to prevent STDs.The nurse told Emily she was there for her, and if she was uncomfortable at any point, they could stop and take a break.She asked a series of questions.What did she remember? Where had the incident taken place, and what had the man done? This would be the first of three times in one night that Emily would be asked to recount that night.The nurse gently scraped Emily’s fingernails for DNA evidence in case she had scratched the man. The nurse asked Emily to disrobe and used a black light to scan the front and back of her body, searching for any of the man’s bodily fluids on her skin.“I remember feeling cold,” Emily said, “and wanting it to be over.”Next came the worst part. Emily lay on the hospital bed, her feet in the stirrups. The nurse prepared to use a speculum to gather DNA from her vagina. Emily pictured the man entering her and felt the pain all over again.She burst into tears. The nurse paused, giving Emily the time she needed.“I had to turn my head and imagine I was somewhere completely else.”Chapter 4The rape kit took four hours to complete. Then began the second round of questions from the police.A patrol officer — not the same one who’d questioned her earlier — put Emily at ease. Emily told him that she wanted to report a rape.She was terrified to pursue an investigation. It could take months and would require her to relive the night over and over again.She weighed her options with representatives from Middle Way House, a victim advocate and support center, who were present during the exam. She decided she needed to stand up for herself. More importantly, she had to try to stop him from doing this again.“I want him to be questioned,” she said to the officer. “I want this to go further.”The officer drove Emily to the police station to speak with Detective Richard Crussen. Walking through her brief recollection of the night, she felt the need to justify all of her actions.“Did you give him directions to your house?” she remembers Crussen asking. I have no idea, Emily thought. In her impaired state, she might have thought he was simply a friend driving her home. But she could prove nothing.“Why didn’t you report the sexual assault to the first patrol officer?” he asked. Emily knew that her story, and the fact that she couldn’t remember anything, sounded very convenient to outsiders.“I just felt so deeply, physically and emotionally violated that I couldn’t ... not say anything,” Emily said.Emily said the detective later told her that he had interviewed Phil in person and had requested surveillance videos from Dunnkirk. Analyzing her text messages with Phil, the detective encouraged Emily to continue texting him in the hopes of learning more about his intentions. Detectives often ask victims to communicate with suspects in order to get information out of them about the night, said Fawcett, the sex crimes prosecutor.Emily kept texting Phil. She hoped he would admit that he knew she was too drunk to give consent.“When did I throw up? Also my clothes were in the corner and smelled like pee...did I piss myself? Because I don’t know if I could ever recover from that lol”“I don’t think you peed yourself and i think you threw up around 2:30 i’m not quite sure on the time cause my phone died by then.”“You sure? Trying to figure out the mystery of that smell lol you still wanted to have sex with me after I threw up? Haha brave soul.”“I did come help you when i heard that thud from the bathroom.”Emily kept the tone of her texts as light as possible — she thought it would be easier to gain information from him if she remained levelheaded.“I don’t think I’d get much out of him by saying ‘You raped me,’” she said.In the months that followed, Emily couldn’t focus. She started skipping classes and then withdrew from IU for the rest of the school year. She never followed through with her training to become a police officer. But she stayed in her Bloomington apartment. For weeks, she slept in her roommate’s bed, out of fear of sleeping in her own.She felt dirty, shameful and hopeless. Was it her fault? Was there something about her, or something she did that night, that had set her up to be the victim?She emailed the police constantly for updates, even though they never reached out to her.“I felt like I was being forgotten,” Emily said.On Nov. 4, after waiting three weeks with no updates, she emailed Detective Crussen. He responded the next day, saying he had just left the office of Darcie Fawcett, the prosecutor.“Based on what we have at this point, including reviewing the text messages between you and him, she is inclined not to prosecute,” Crussen wrote.Emily received no phone call and no further explanation.Chapter 5Fawcett was only a few months into her new position in the sex crimes division when she read through Emily’s file.After reviewing the evidence, the prosecutor spoke to both Crussen and another prosecutor before making her decision. Fawcett said she always gets a second opinion. She never takes her decisions lightly.There was Emily’s memory loss, the fact that she hadn’t reported the sexual assault to the first police officer, the absence of physical injuries — all of these factors made it extremely difficult to prove that Emily had been incapable of giving consent. But the toughest blow to the case was the transcript of the text messages from Phil — the responses to the same text messages the detective had encouraged Emily to send and that Emily had hoped would help her case.Reading Phil’s responses to Emily’s texts made Fawcett believe that he was caught off guard.“I had no idea beforehand you were that bad off,” Phil wrote. “I should have asked I’m sorry.”“I just wanted to apologize again for how I behaved Saturday night.”To the prosecutor, the messages indicated that Phil had probably not been aware of how impaired Emily had been. Fawcett said there is a big difference between someone who is simply drunk and someone who is incapable of walking, holding conversations or giving consent.“Was she so intoxicated that she couldn’t consent?” Fawcett said. “I don’t think I could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she was.”Even if Emily had blacked out, there may have been no way for the man to know she was that impaired.A lack of consent is not enough to criminalize a rape case under Indiana law. Many people who report a sexual assault say that they felt frozen with fear and didn’t fight or even say no. Unfortunately, Fawcett said, that doesn’t carry enough weight in court.If she had taken Emily’s case to court, defense attorneys would have questioned how Phil knew where Emily lived. She must have invited him over, they would say. Fawcett didn’t want to set Emily up for failure or further victim-blaming.No call is easy, the prosecutor said. Her biggest frustration is the disparity between the number of sexual assaults reported and the number of cases she reviews that she feels confident in filing for charges.Fawcett said it is hard to pinpoint any one reason for this gap. Cases can stall at several stages before reaching her office. Many victims back out after filing a police report — often out of fear of social stigma, retaliation or having to endure a months-long criminal process. Occasionally, detectives will decide not to send a case to the sex crimes prosecutor because they believe charges would not be likely. Fawcett said she wishes she could review all cases.The prosecutor said she has to pay attention not just to the feelings of the accuser but to the fairness of any charges brought against the accused.“I’m dealing with people’s lives here,” the prosecutor said.Chapter 6Today, Emily is back in classes, and she has applied to graduate school. She plans to lead focus groups on campus to educate students on bystander intervention.But she still wakes up out of breath at night with nightmares of being raped.Emily tells herself that Fawcett’s decision was made in her best interest, and her case was bound for failure. But the justice system, she said, is not set up to benefit survivors of sexual assault.“I did the right thing and nothing happened,” she says, sitting on a couch in her apartment, fighting off tears. “I spoke up, and I wasn’t heard.”She hates to say it, but sometimes she wonders if her case would have reached a jury if Phil had been more violent.“If he had slapped me around a little, given me a big old bruise on my face, broken a limb ... maybe I would’ve been taken more seriously.”The texts from Phil seemed to show remorse, she admits. But should remorse excuse violating another person’s body?Emily said she doesn’t think of Phil as an innately bad person. He just made a bad decision, a decision that she believes is much too common on college campuses. She will never regret taking criminal action.“It would’ve been easier if I would’ve done nothing,” she said, but, “it was important to me that I said something.”For IU Bloomington resources and steps to follow if you are sexually assaulted click here.',\n",

       "  'body': 'There are 46,416 students attending IU. More than 25 percent of college students have been diagnosed or treated by a professional for a mental health condition within the past year, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. At IU, there are a total of 21 professionals working for Counseling and Psychological Services.Out of those 21 individuals, there are 17 therapists, two psychiatrists and two sexual assault counselors. If the CAPS’ professional faculty equally treated 25 percent of IU’s student population, each professional would be responsible for helping 552 students whose mental health may be affected. And as the two sexual assault counselors likely only work with cases involving sexual assault, that would put more students off on the remaining 19 officials. The ?apparent lack of funding and help for individuals potentially in need of a mental health program at IU isn’t something that’s well known or even talked about on campus.I’ve slowly realized these services are necessary and should be more attainable on campus. One example: A colleague of mine attempted to reach out to CAPS this semester and was informed he couldn’t get an appointment for at least two to three weeks.College is a pivotal time in our lives. We arrive as naive freshmen who are nervous yet excited about this new chapter. There’s no longer a curfew, and your mom isn’t yelling at you to clean your room.You are finally free. But at the same time, you are newly alone. According to NAMI, “one in four young adults ?between the ages of 18 and 24 have a diagnosable mental illness.” This startling fact is widely unknown at IU, and I think it’s time we realize this is an issue.The first step in this process is IU’s administration recognizing the serious lack of staff and funding in our mental health program.The second step would be to reach out to donors and alumni and ask them to donate. Unlike re-doing the perfectly fine arboretum, updating and expanding our mental health programs will better the lives of the students in need of these services.Not only will it directly influence those who may suffer from a mental illness, it will affect those who surround themselves with these ?individuals.Sometimes it’s hard to seek out help and confide in a friend you’ve only known for a short period of time at college. By having these programs in place, and multiple alleys to go down for help, people who find themselves in need of psychological support can quickly and easily get ?assistance.In IU-Bloomington’s mission statement, it says our campus has a commitment to ensure “meaningful experiences outside the classroom.”In order to guarantee these meaningful experiences, our administration needs to create a better way for students with a mental health concern to easily access IU’s mental health resources in a timely and cost-effective manner.jlkarl@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Indiana Daily Student ran an article Oct. 24, 2014, about a legislative resolution that was proposed and written mainly by the Indiana Public Interest Research Group that strove to change the way optional student fees are ?implemented.Currently, student groups on campus who wish to be placed on the Optional Bursar Fee listing must gain signatures from 25 percent of the student body. Those organizations that are successful must then receive funds from at least 10 percent of the student body to remain on the listing.Students are presented the list of organizations when they register for classes. The current organizations on the list are IU Dance Marathon, the Red Cross, the Sexual Assault Fund and the Student ?Sustainability Council.With more than 750 student groups on IU’s campus and only four being serviced by this option, it’s clear there needs to be a change.The change offered by INPIRG, however, is not the change we need.In its vision, INPIRG would have the student fee listing be an opt-out option. This means that students would have to unselect optional fees they don’t wish to pay, as opposed to selecting optional fees they wish to pay. It preys on students who don’t pay attention.I understand calls from the other side that say those students ought to be more careful when clicking through screens that may impose fees. However, relying on psychology and trickery to force students to either pay attention or accidentally incur fees they may not be able to afford is not serving our students well, nor honestly.My concerns are echoed by a supermajority of the IU Student Association Congress, of which I am a part, which voted to table the resolution offered by INPIRG. The resolution has all but died since, as in my mind, it should.Monday, the IUSA Student Life Committee passed my resolution for a new student fee system that would allow student organizations to gain signatures from 10 percent of the student body. After doing so, these organizations would be placed on the IUSA ballot as a referendum. They must receive 20 percent of the student body’s vote to be placed on the Bursar list. They will then remain on the list for 3 years.By doing so, I hope organizations will get involved with IUSA, students will pay attention because of organizations and clubs they’re a member of and democracy will once again flourish at IU.Most importantly, there would be no risk of students accidentally being charged money they did not select to pay themselves. Those in opposition will say this will not yield sufficient funding for clubs. However, I uphold democracy and honesty above all else.The resolution will go before the IU Student Association Congress on Monday. I plan to speak on behalf of my resolution, because democracy must be optional for it to be a true democracy.ajguenth@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Meet Jackie, a freshman at the University of Virginia. She just got asked to a fraternity party by a really cute guy she knows.Long story short, Jackie says she spent hours preparing for her date only to be gang raped for hours by seven men in her date’s fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi, according to a Rolling Stone article.Meet Jackie’s three friends, who tell bloody-clothed and abused Jackie to second guess going to the hospital because they worry “she’s gonna be the girl who cried ‘rape,’” and they fear they’ll, “never be ?allowed into any frat party again.”Aside from the obvious rape issue that has repetitively come to surface at many universities across the nation, the ignorance toward rape has seeped into the minds of the students attending these schools.Jackie’s friends told her not to go to the hospital simply because her reputation would be tainted.This opinion is mirrored when Jackie went to the head of UVA’s sexual misconduct board and asked why she couldn’t find campus records for sexual assault. Dean Nicole Eramo simply answered, “because nobody wants to send their daughter to the rape school.”Hiding rape statistics isn’t a little white lie.By skewing and concealing these facts, the administration harmed both the students’ and the university’s reputation.Jackie says she was sexually abused in 2012. Her story wasn’t released by UVA’s administration — it was told by a journalist at Rolling Stone.Sure, all is fine and dandy when the real information is shoved in a closet or hidden behind a curtain. But one article like this can open the floodgates to countless sexual violence protesters, opinionated bloggers and political leaders.In some ways, today’s media enables stories like this to be heard by many ears, therefore causing a school administration to submit a formal apology.But an apology isn’t action — it’s just words.The action the university took was the suspension of all campus fraternities until Jan. 9.A childish time-out for all brotherhoods is too small of a penance for such a serious issue. Instead, the government should step in to call into question the ethics that are instilled on campuses such as UVA.Although one — or seven — man’s ?actions can’t speak for an entire university, it can speak for an entire culture. This common culture that exists among many university campuses is accepting of rape, and it has got to stop.First and foremost, the UVA administration should have the inherent moral commitment to protect its students, not misguide its future ones by putting on a façade of not being a “rape school.”Though the media has gotten the ball rolling, it’s the government’s job to keep the same ball rolling by implementing policies regarding campus sexual ?misconduct.It makes one wonder how many untold stories are out there and people who believe that telling their story “isn’t worth the hassle.”Admitting you’ve been sexually assaulted shouldn’t be a burden, but the reality is some of today’s policies surrounding rape don’t exactly warmly welcome the victims.Instead, the process and stigma associated with admitting you’ve been raped is almost sympathized to a point where onlookers perceive them as “wounded victims.”The Rolling Stone article and its effects prove UVA’s administration isn’t equipped to properly handle instances like this one.Universities should become more detached from the rape arbitration process, and the government needs to get involved.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Interfraternity Council at IU announced that November would be sexual assault awareness month for greek chapters. To show its support, Pi Kappa Alpha launched a social media campaign called Shatter the Silence.On Nov. 17 the fraternity released a video similar to the White House campaign It’s On Us to end sexual violence on college campuses.Fraternity brothers and members of Chi Omega and Delta Phi Epsilon sororities were featured in the minute and a half video reading off sexual assault statistics.Pikes recruited help from sorority women and faculty as well as national support to further their efforts.“We can’t just let it be a women’s issue because that’s not solving such a large part of the problem,” Pikes Health and Safety Chair Patrick O’Malley said. “That doesn’t help us stop men from ?sexually assaulting women. By putting it all on women, then it’s them trying to avoid it and not really having guys take a positive role in the prevention of it.”The video was then followed by a social media campaign headed by Pikes President Bill Phan. On Nov. 20, the fraternity chapter’s Twitter @IU_Pikes tweeted a sexual assault statistic every thirty minutes with the hashtag #ShattertheSilence.“The majority of sexual assaults on campus are from greek life,” Phan said. “Obviously since we’re a greek fraternity, we need to make sure our guys are educated, so they know what is the line and what isn’t the line.”After three days, the video had more than 2,000 views on Youtube. As of Sunday, the Shatter the Silence hashtag has been tweeted 202 times in the last 10 days, according to Twitter analytic website Topsy.“I think this is the best way to do it,” Theta Phi Alpha member Lauren Devereux said. “When everybody is on board and working together to say, ‘We’re going to shatter the silence, we’re going to talk about this,’ that’s when things are going to start changing.”According to oneinfour.org , fraternity men are three times more likely to commit sexual assault than other college men, based off of two different longitudinal studies. These types of statistics create a negative stigma and reputation for the community as a whole, Phan said.“That’s kind of embarrassing, not just for them (those involved) but for the entire greek community,” Phan said. “Obviously when you’re in the greek community, people typically have the negatives, not the positives, so that kind of hurts all of us.”In addition to IU’s campus-wide sexual assault survey sent out by Provost and Executive Vice President Lauren Robel and Dean of Students Harold Goldsmith, IFC and Panhellenic Association forwarded chapters information to take the ?national It’s On Us pledge against sexual assault.The video and social campaign were the first steps in a three-step process, Phan said. First, the fraternity aimed to educate the community through its video, then generate conversation through its social presence. The final step will be ongoing prevention, Phan said.For national sexual assault awareness month in April , Pikes plan to work with sorority women to hand out teal ribbons to keep the conversation going.“We are using this month to make a big step forward, but we’re not just going to end it at the end of the month,” O’Malley said. “I want to make sure we, as a chapter, stress that it’s a 24/7, 365 days kind of issue, and it’s not just for one month out of the year.”',\n",

This is not the point.“Feminist” isn’t a “dirty word.” It’s a political identity and a way of life. And it is something that needs to exist in this world, because sexual assault and discrimination against women runs rampant.We understand TIME’s poll has no real effect and that it won’t make feminism actually disappear, obviously. However, the sentiment is still the same. It indicates there are people who still believe feminism isn’t necessary.Because men and women are treated completely equal in every way, said no one ever.Now, it’s perfectly acceptable for people not to be feminist activists. If marching, rallying or cheering for feminist causes doesn’t quite get you turnt, we understand.However, feminism is defined by Merriam Webster as “the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.”That’s something every single person should be behind. And if they aren’t, then they are, quite honestly, basic.In today’s society, we should stop pretending it’s acceptable to not be a feminist. Not supporting equality for one group of people is known as many things. Not many people will freely say blacks and whites shouldn’t be equal. However, so many people freely say feminism should not be a thing.Saying you don’t support feminism is the same thing as saying you don’t support equal pay, equal opportunities in the workplace or equal standards of health care for women.On their survey, the editor of TIME, Nancy Gibbs, posted a statement, apologizing for the inclusion of “feminist” on the list. She said TIME meant to “invite debate about some ways the word was used this year.”That’s literally not even the point.The fact that TIME included “feminist” in the list was obviously a bad idea in general. However, the more terrifying fact is it won with a plurality of the votes.The editorial board feels as though this is a shocking insight into our culture in this nation.To us, feminists will always be bae.',\n",

Meme me! #cosbymeme.”I love “The Cosby Show.” I watched “Little Bill,” and some of my favorite Jimmy Fallon interviews are the ones with Cosby.I now am completely disgusted to have said any of that, even momentarily excluding whether or not the allegations are even true.Whether or not they were true, which we’ll get to in just a hot second, Cosby is a well-known public figure and should have conducted himself in a professional and respectful manner, if for nothing else than for those who actually have been victims of abuse and rape.Turning sexual assault accusations into a joke perpetuates a culture that allows people to abuse others with little to no repercussions.We face serious problems in our culture when it comes to the stigma associated with victims of abuse and rape, male or female.We ask questions about what the victim was wearing, doing or saying and respond primarily with victim shaming and ?faulting.This situation is a prime example.These women who have accused Cosby of abusive actions have all come forward with personal accounts of their ?assaults.Some have spoken out multiple times.Now, whether or not that is the result of the desire to gain media attention, money or to reveal what they have been too intimidated to say, it shouldn’t be taken into account until after Cosby is thoroughly ?investigated.I am so sick and tired of the celebrity status of accused abusers being an invincibility mechanism, protecting them from any repercussions other than a tarnished reputation.There is no reason for people to let Cosby once again respond to these events with just a shaking of the head.This time around, these women deserve the investigation and in-depth situational analysis, which should always be administered in a situation of sexual assault.cmcelwa@indiana.edu',\n",

This is just one of the more public attacks. Most don’t make the headlines, but you can still read about them with surprising frequency in the Indiana Daily Student.IU is one of 55 college campuses under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights for possibly violating federal laws on how to respond to sexual assaults, which is also terrifying for ?students.This survey is much-needed, even overdue. It aligns with the White House Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault.This campaign called for colleges to administer fact-finding surveys in April.The sponsors of the survey include the Office of the Provost, the IU Student Welfare Initiative and the IU Women’s Philanthropy Council.The drafters include the Dean of Students Office and the Kinsey ?Institute.This survey is just one of a few measures IU is trying to take in order to get a better handle on what the White House is calling an epidemic.That’s good — they should be.The Washington Post ranks IU-Bloomington among campuses with the highest rates of forcible sexual assault offenses in the country, with 54 reported cases from 2010 to 2012.Those are our fellow students. Those are people we know, our classmates, our floormates, our friends.That is our campus that is unsafe, our home or our home away from home. And it is our provost’s office that is under investigation for possibly not handling these cases according to federal laws.Understanding the available information about sexual assault on campus and the definition of consent as well as the procedures for reporting sexual assault are the first steps the administration is taking to fix the climate on this campus.However, the survey itself won’t actually serve the students.It is only what the administration does with the information that will matter.Hopefully it doesn’t stop with the survey, and we see some real change.

       "  'body': 'President Obama announced Saturday the United States will contribute $3 billion to an effort to fight climate change.The donation is going to an international fund with the intention to aid the world’s poorest countries in addressing the effects of climate change, according to the New York Times.This announcement was made at a summit meeting of 20 industrial powers in Brisbane, Australia, and came on the heels of another stunning reveal: the U.S. and China are coming together to jointly curb greenhouse gas emissions throughout the course of the next 10 years.Initially, the news is thrilling.At long last, perhaps, the horrifying reality of irreversible climate change has reached a point so dramatic it demands the attention of even the most stubborn, short-sighted politicians.One would hope the $3 billion Obama has designated for supporting the world’s poorest nations in their efforts to contribute to the global ecosystem rather than destroy it will also stimulate those nations’ economies.This would hopefully result in wealthier planet-conscious countries providing funds, as well.Alas, it seems these hopes are to remain hopes.The U.S.‘s contribution seems less powerful in comparison to Samsung’s recent announcement of plans to build a $3 billion factory for a new smartphone in Vietnam.If Samsung can drop that kind of change on a factory, how much difference is the U.S.’s donation really making?In many ways, this ?“solution” is consistent with Obama’s recent mode of operation.As we saw with the “It’s On Us” campaign to end sexual assault on college campuses, our nation’s leader clearly prefers raising awareness about an issue rather than passing effective legislation or ?enacting any sort of lasting change.The comparison to Samsung highlights the money’s insignificance.In light of that revelation, it seems Obama was likely motivated more by spite for the midterm election’s spectacular failure than concern for the ?environment.This huge contribution reads like a thumbed-nose to the Republican House and newly Republican Senate — it’s Obama’s way of reminding us he’s still president for a short while yet and can give $3 billion to fight climate change if he wants to.The headline “U.S. contributes billions to fight climate change” has a glorious ring to it but pales in comparison to both the magnitude of the issue at stake and the global significance of the amount.Per usual, Obama is thinking in the right direction but lacks the gumption or legislative power to make a significant, lasting change.The idea of stimulating poorer countries and encouraging their green efforts with contributions to a general international fund is terrific in theory but needs to be a stronger weapon for such a ?formidable foe.sbkissel@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Students will receive an email from IU this week asking them to complete an anonymous survey about their perceptions of campus sexual assault.The IU Bloomington Community Attitudes and Experiences with Sexual Assault survey aims to gain information about the prevalence of sexual assault and student views on the University’s efforts to respond to and prevent sexual violence on campus.All undergraduate and graduate students ages 18 or older are invited to take the survey before Dec. 2, and survey findings will be released this spring, according to the University.The survey is sponsored by the Office of the Provost, the IU Student Welfare Initiative and the IU Women’s Philanthropy Council, and it is being carried out and analyzed by the Dean of Students Office and the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction. A third-party assessment and data management firm called Campus Labs will be administering the survey, said Mark Land, IU spokesperson said.Leslie Fasone, assistant dean of students for women’s and gender affairs , played a leading role in the coordination of the survey. She said she hopes the survey results will serve as a guide for how IU can improve its prevention and response efforts.“I’m hopeful that the survey will provide us with a big-picture perspective,” Fasone said. “I also think the survey can serve as a baseline, this measure we can build off of.”Completing the survey will take about 15 to 20 minutes, according to the University, and those who complete the survey will be entered into a drawing to win one of 400 $50 Amazon gift cards.The survey begins by asking questions about whether or not students feel safe and comfortable on campus, and if IU is doing enough to ensure student safety.Students will answer questions about their past involvement in bystander intervention training and their awareness of campus resources and support for victims of sexual assault.The survey also asks students if they think there is anything they can do about the issue of sexual assault on campus, and whether or not they would feel confident intervening in a situation involving a sexual ?assault.It provides participants with a list of phrases and asks them to select which phrases they believe indicate a lack of consent.They must also rate to what degree they agree with statements such as, “The more alcohol a person has consumed, the less able he/she is to consent to sexual activity” or “When a person is drinking alcohol, he or she is implying interest in engaging in sexual activity.”Although the survey is completely anonymous, students are asked to provide information about their year in school, ethnic background, sexual orientation, relationship status and involvement in student organizations.Fasone said that by gathering information about differences between domestic and international students, greek and non-greek students, and undergraduate and graduate students, the University can understand how to focus its prevention efforts.“We know there are certain groups that are at higher risks,” Fasone said. “That’s going to tell us, ‘OK, this group needs this type of education.’”The survey incentives, creation and final report will cost the University about $20,000 to $30,000 and is funded through the Office of the Provost and the Women’s Philanthropy Council, Land said.The team has been working on the survey for more than a year, Land said. Planning efforts began before the Department of Education announced its Office of Civil Rights investigation into the University’s compliance with Title IX sexual harassment and sexual violence policies. Since March, IU has been providing the Office of Civil Rights with documents and information about its sexual assault reporting procedures and prevention efforts.Since then, IU has launched its Student Welfare Initiative to boost sexual assault prevention and response efforts. Last week, the University was also awarded a one-year, $165,000 Indiana Department of Health grant to expand its efforts.“This is a fact-finding mission,” Land said about the survey. “It’s not about us being able to say things are great on campus.”Land said he realizes that many students taking the survey will have personal experiences related to sexual assault, and that there will also likely be some negative responses.“We’d like to think we’re doing a lot already, but no one is under the illusion that there isn’t a lot more work to be done,” ?Land said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'In the wake of a home invasion Sunday in which two IU students were reportedly sexually assaulted and threatened with firearms, IU spokesman Mark Land said IU Police Department officials are striving to further ensure the safety of students both on and ?off campus.IUPD is always looking for ways to keep people safe, he said.Following a blog post created by Associate Vice President for Public Safety and Institutional Assurance Mark Bruhn, Land said IUPD was planning on formally and routinely extending their police presence off campus to places similar to where the aforementioned invasion ?occurred.“We thought we could help add a little layer of protection,” ?Land said.Though no specific routes could be cited, Land said the parameters will be stretched out a few blocks past campus boundaries.IUPD Lieutenant Craig Munroe said this is not the first time the department has extended its work past campus property.It’s been done for years.IUPD has county-wide jurisdiction, Munroe said.They work off campus frequently and collaborate with the Bloomington Police Department, who also has jurisdiction on campus, ?he said.“We’re just expanding our responsibilities a little bit more,” ?he said.Currently, IUPD patrols in four districts that meet at 10th Street and Jordan Avenue, he said. This area is what is covered by IUPD for statistical purposes such as crime report data.“We’re moving off these hard boundaries,” Munroe said, explaining that the primary responsibility of IUPD is to protect students, both on and off campus.Land said the expansion is a logical extension of what IUPD already covers, such as off-campus housing with high student populations.“There are areas of overlap that make sense,” ?he said.Land said this is by no means meant to imply that BPD does not do a great job in its jurisdiction.“City helps us, (and) we like to help city,” Munroe said, explaining that IUPD and BPD train and work together frequently.There are no jurisdictional fights, he said.“People want to know their students are going to be safe,” Munroe said.Along with the extended patrol routes, Land said IUPD also offers several self-defense classes that run when enough students are interested to fill a course.“These are the kinds of resources we’d like students to know exist,” Land said.Land said IUPD wants to be more than just generic uniforms behind the tinted windows of squad cars.Munroe said the class, the Rape Aggression Defense System, is geared toward teaching women defense tactics.Land said IUPD is constantly examining what they do and what they can offer the community to make themselves more ?effective.After all of the attention that events of this past weekend received, he said it seemed an appropriate time to remind people what IUPD is doing to look out for their safety, as well as provide them with a tangible change in the patrol parameters.Land said this is the time to show people what resources IUPD has and also that they take issues like this very seriously.Munroe said IUPD is doing all that it can to ensure the safety of the University’s students.“It’s information people need to have,” he said.',\n",

Deweese, 19, and Vaylan Keishaun Glazebrook, 19, both of Indianapolis, were arrested on preliminary felony charges of attempted murder, rape while armed with a weapon, burglary while armed with a weapon, confinement while armed with a weapon, intimidation with a weapon and resisting law enforcement with a weapon.A third man, Jesse Benti-Torres, 19, of Danville, Ind., was arrested on preliminary charges of burglary while armed with a weapon and assisting a criminal.Diekoff said the suspects forced entry into an apartment in the 500 block of east 12th Street.While in the house, they reportedly sexually assaulted two 24-year-old females at gunpoint.Police officers responded to a call at about 4:30 a.m. regarding a possible rape in progress at the residence. The caller indicated that she thought one of her roommates might be being raped, Diekoff said.Upon arrival, an officer went to the front door and noticed that the door was partially open. He observed a male inside an interior doorway putting on his pants.The officer identified himself as police. The officer then heard two gunshots and took cover.The officer, William Abram, went to the westside of the residence and saw two males coming out of a window who then fled south, police said.He heard another gunshot and saw the muzzle flash as one of the suspects fired at him.Abram returned fire with his duty weapon, reportedly hitting Glazebrook in the arm and Deweese in the leg.The suspects were taken to the hospital as were the victims. Though the women are not believed to have sustained life-threatening injuries, their condition is not yet known.An internal investigation is also being conducted because a police officer fired his weapon.

       "  'body': 'The increased frequency of sexual assaults on college campuses across the country and how said institutions address the issue have sparked a national conversation.According to the National Institute of Justice, one in 20 women report being raped in college, and many other assaults go unreported to authorities.In January, President Obama launched the “Not Alone” campaign to raise awareness and start a dialogue. The campaign aims to make educating students on sexual assault a priority across campuses, according to the campaign’s website.IU-Bloomington, which was included on a list of institutions that may have violated federal law in how they respond to instances of sexual assault. The list released by the federal Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights.IU is aiming to improve the university response to the issue.“I believe the reason why there has been an increase in reports over the past few years is because we are creating an environment where students don’t feel embarrassed to report these incidents,” said Ann Skirvin, a mental health counselor at IU Health Center’s Counseling and Psychological Services.The Student Welfare Initiative is part of the Office for Civil Rights compliance audit that helps increase awareness around issues of sexual ?violence.Through this University-wide initiative, the focus is on engaging men in sexual violence protection, conducting surveys to identify trends and gaps and teaching men to respond efficiently and effectively in unsafe situations.“It’s a privilege to attend a university, so it’s our job to make sure that it maintains a safe environment,” said Leslie Fasone, IU assistant dean of students for women’s and gender affairs.Additionally, one in 16 men are victims of sexual assault. This rate is also gradually increasing year.“More women than men report incidents involving sexual assault, but more men are reporting than ever before,” Skirvin said. “The efforts of college campuses and sexual assault services make it easier for students, men and women, to open up about the sexual assault experiences without feeling embarrassed or ashamed of what happened.”At IU, if a student is a witness to a sexual assault, they are taught to take initiative and get immediate help through the IU Crisis Center as well as emergency services.“Be an advocate for your friends and peers and look out for one another,” said Michael Rangel, a sophomore and part of the School of Social Work at IU.With the White House’s “Not Alone” campaign and campuses trying to be advocates for their student body, the next step to finding a solution to sexual assault has to be taken.“It starts with the school officials,” Skirvin said. “We need to hold the perpetrators accountable and have them taken out of school.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Lena Dunham is known as a pretty open person who often over-shares. But after the backlash she’s received from her book, the Indiana Daily Student Editorial Board can only hope she’ll learn to think about what she’s saying before she publishes it.Dunham’s problem comes from accusations that she sexually assaulted her sister, Grace Dunham, based off of passages written in Lena’s memoir, “Not that Kind of Girl.”In the book, Lena discusses a time when she looked into her sister’s vagina, which she passed off as just being a curious child. As the sisters grew older, Dunham revealed that she would pay Grace in candy or coins to kiss her and admitted to masturbating in the same bed as her sister while Grace slept.Though the acts Dunham describes sound sexual in nature, her mind was not developed enough yet to understand what she was actually doing. This sexual behavior is actually common among ?children.It was the way Dunham wrote these passages that was inappropriate. While these parts of the book reveal a lot about Lena, they also delve deeply into Grace’s personal life, and Dunham has a history of exposing her sister.In Grace’s senior year of high school, Grace came out to Dunham as a lesbian. Grace was not yet ready to tell their parents, and instead of agreeing with her sister’s wishes, Lena took it upon herself to tell Grace’s secret to their parents.In an interview with the New York Times, Dunham told writer Meghan Duam, “Basically, it’s like I can’t keep my own secrets. And I consider Grace to be an extension of me, and therefore, I couldn’t handle the fact that she’s a very private person with her own value system and her own aesthetic and that we do different things.”Grace expressed frustration at her sister taking her privacy into her own hands in the same interview.“Most of our fights have revolved around my feeling like Lena took her approach to her own personal life and made my personal life her property.”Dunham’s tendency to control her sister and this insensitive sharing of childhood experiences shows how she treats Grace as an object instead of a family member.Aside from the over-controlling nature Dunham revealed having over Grace, Dunham also offended people with a rather tasteless joke. In her book, she jokes that she bribed her sister with candy and says, “...anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl, I was ?trying.”By joking that she acted like a child predator, Dunham put herself in a position to receive harsh criticism. Because she was dealing with such sensitive subject manner, the joke was in poor taste.This joke also discounts situations in which people have really been sexually assaulted. Dunham did not seem to realize at the time that the joke could be taken offensively, and she later apologized.When writing the passage, Dunham should have considered that many of her readers might not be aware that this behavior is common among children. She should have added more explanation of her actions instead of including inappropriate jokes.Dunham did not handle the writing of her experience seriously or sensitively. Hopefully, she learned she needs to give more clear context for sensitive subject manner in her writing.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The best way to prevent sexual assault is with education, programs and open discussions meant to identify the problems involving sexual assault in today’s world.All too often, however, these tactics fail and sexual assaults are attempted or occur.In that moment, proper self-defense training can mean the difference between a tragedy and a tragedy avoided.Currently, the IU Police Department offers the Rape Aggression Defense and IUPD2 programs, both of which focus on self-defense training. These programs are also solely ?offered to women.It’s all too often that programs like this, created and organized with good intentions, inadvertently portray some very harmful values or beliefs.While I don’t argue that these programs are good for the campus, restrictions placed on gender are harmful to the overall campus atmosphere on a level that many don’t see.By offering self-defense classes solely to women, a perception is created where women are seen as the only victims of sexual assault and other violent crimes. In reality, this isn’t even close to being the case.According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, men are more likely to be victims of serious physical assault than women, who are more likely to be victim of sexual assault.However, numbers aren’t everything. One person, regardless of gender, being sexually assaulted is one person too many.By offering self-defense classes solely to women we’re implying, whether we intend to or not, that female victims of violence are victims because they’re inherently weaker than men, not because said ?at tackers are violent.It also implies that male victims of violence, especially sexual violence, are victims because they’re weak. It stigmatizes men who’ve been victimized, which results in a lack of reporting, a lack of discussion and a lack of overall acknowledgement of ?male-targeted violence.Through my role as an IU Student Association Congressman, I authored a resolution to encourage IUPD to expand their Rape Aggression Defense and IUPD2 programs to be offered to both males and ?females.To support the privacy and possible wishes of participants, I agreed that separating the class by gender when requested is the best option.It’s exceedingly important to me that all students be afforded the opportunity to receive training from our police department in ?manners such as these.Treating crimes as different between the genders when it comes to prevention makes little to no sense.Rape, sexual assault and violent crime are societal problems that need to be addressed by everyone.Every single pe rson should be aware of these programs, how to prevent violent crime and how to combat it if they’re ?confronted with it.Those locked in battle cannot pick and choose who wants to assist.Likewise, we can’t pick and choose who we want to be able to protect ?themselves.ajguenth@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Zombies filled Dunn Meadow on Saturday night as part of Union Board’s first Zombie 5K.Body and Mind, one of Union Board’s 12 committees, organizes events advocating health and wellness on the IU campus. BAM integrated programs with Halloween this year to keep their events entertaining and fun.The Zombie 5K provided students a safe and enjoyable opportunity to participate in Halloween festivities while fundraising for the Middle Way House, a local Bloomington shelter for victims of domestic violence.The shelter has been available as a safe house from violence and sexual assault for more than 30 years, offering crisis intervention, support groups and safe housing for those who can’t afford it.“When we were selecting the charity that we wanted to have the proceeds go to, people in the committee made an emphasis on selecting a charity that was local so that we could impact the Bloomington community,” BAM Assistant Director Valarie ?Kumalo said.Participants of the Zombie 5K paid an $8 registration fee, some of which went directly to fundraise for the Middle Way House.“It seems to be more that it’s a donation just because a portion of the proceeds are going to Middle Way House,” BAM Director DeAnthony Nelson said. “At the same time you’re paying $8, but you get a T-shirt with that. You get to participate in the festivities in Dunn Meadow. You get so much out of that $8. I would consider it free.”While raising money for Middle Way House was a major incentive for the event, providing Halloween activities for students was also a huge part of the Zombie 5K, Nelson said. Participants were recommended to run the 5K in ?costume.The run started at 5 p.m., while walkers began at 5:10 p.m. The route itself was full of Halloween-themed decorations, including spiders, skeletons and cobwebs. There were actors from the theater department dressed up like zombies and other terrifying creatures.The actors weren’t allowed to chase the runners but instead hid themselves and popped out from behind trees.An after party immediately followed the 5K.BAM’s committee set up obstacle course inflatables, caricature tables, balloon artists, pumpkin carving, food tables and a photo booth to capture the moment.The after party had live music, including a concert by the Atomic Dog Brass Band, a local Bloomington brass band.“We’re here for the students, and we want the students to get an opportunity to be able to market themselves and show their talent because we have a lot of talented students on the IU campus,” Nelson said. “That’s why we chose to go with something local, something that we felt like we needed to support because you can always get large ?concerts.”DJs performed before and after the Atomic Dog Brass Band. The 5K and after party were offered as something students wouldn’t normally think to do for Halloween on the IU campus, Kumalo said.“It provides other students who are looking for something other than partying to do during Halloween weekend,” Kumalo said. “It’s just an event for students on campus to come, get together and just have fun.”As the event is a fundraiser for the Middle Way House, student volunteers oversaw the majority of it. Volunteers helped set up and tear down the event in Dunn Meadow as well as run the registration tables.“The acting portion of it, so scaring the people, is actually volunteer positions,” Nelson said. “We have, like I said, the makeup artists. That’s going to be volunteer positions. We’re going to have students at the booth to help facilitate that whole thing, like making sure not too many people are going up the King Kong obstacle course at one time.”Nelson said BAM’s committee members chalked, put up flyers on campus and made announcements in classrooms to get the word out for the first Zombie 5K on Bloomington’s campus, hoping for a substantial turnout.“This is a trial and error thing and we definitely want it to continue going on for Halloween because we think it’s a cool event,” Nelson said. “Hopefully this one sets the tone for the rest of them, and people will continuously be signing up and we’ll have more next year and more the year after that.”',\n",

And, our director said, if Rwanda were to become infected, the American Embassy is only a few blocks away from where I have class.We would be safe within the confines of the large, gated compound.Even though I had only been there a week, I felt very connected to the people I had already met — friends, my host family and teachers.Now, I’ve made even deeper ties to people here. If Rwanda were to have another crisis, I would be ushered quickly into safety, a guarantee, while the rest of Rwandans would be left on their own to deal with the problem.I know that would have happened, because it’s exactly what happened in 1994 in Rwanda, when U.S. troops were sent in to save all American citizens, leaving thousands of people they could have saved to die in the ?genocide.The Ebola crisis is a perfect symbol of our views towards Africa — we don’t care, unless it directly affects us.I didn’t quite understand the extent of current American paranoia until I received the email from IU President Michael McRobbie, assuring students that IU is on it, despite the fact that the virus is nowhere near IU, and meanwhile it is estimated that 1 in 4 of his own students will be sexually assaulted on campus this year.Let’s get our priorities straight. Ebola, from places President McRobbie chooses to call “West Africa” or the even broader “Africa” sounds scary, and a tangible virus is easier to fear than rape culture.But these are not hypothetical people, or hypothetical cases. They’re not just news stories or statistics. They’re real people, in real countries that the media seldom mentions by name. Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia are the countries hit the hardest.I challenge everyone at IU to learn the names of these countries. If you’re still scared, educate yourself on the very real, very serious problems these countries are facing.In December, I’ll be coming back from an African country, and I know I’ll have to face the half-joking, ?half-serious, “You don’t have Ebola, do you?” Never mind that Rwanda is about as close to the outbreaks as Seattle is to Philadelphia.Even if Ebola in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea is halted, there will still be orphaned children and poor people left even poorer because of the halted economy and the fact that many of their possessions will have to be burned to prevent further spread of the virus.They don’t have decent healthcare or savings to fall back on. They can’t camp out in the American Embassy when things are tough.Your fear and concern is better placed elsewhere. Channel that into doing something good in the world.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Most of George Will’s writing is innocuous enough.He likes Mitch McConnell. He doesn’t like unions.He likes to call Colorado Democratic Sen. Mark Udall “Mark Uterus.” He doesn’t like to call anything “the war on women.”But the Washington Post columnist frequently crosses a line when it comes to rape and sexual assault. He’s been doing so for more than 20 years.Worse, his sexist, insensitive and dangerously flippant attitudes toward rape run in papers across the country, including the ?Indianapolis Star.He’s America’s most-read columnist, appearing regularly in 328 papers ?nationwide.He should be dumped by every one of them.Before we explain what he’s done and why his views are so detrimental, a word about free speech.George Will, to our knowledge, has never overtly threatened anyone in his columns. He’s never voiced fighting words or filled a column to the brim with ?profanity.That means his speech, however objectionable — and boy, is it objectionable — is legally protected. He won’t go to jail for publicly shaming rape victims and trivializing sexual ?harassment.But the right to say something is different from the right to a paid column in a newspaper. In fact, there is no right to a paid column in a newspaper. The Constitution is defiantly mute on the subject.Insisting George Will should be dropped from his national platform isn’t attacking his right to free speech.He would be more than welcome to start his own blog, or maybe even an edgy zine (title suggestions: Will’s Will; George Will Not Be ?Silenced; By George).We acknowledge that Will can say whatever he wants. We just contest that he gets to do it in actual ?newspapers.Will’s most recent offense was a June 2014 column in which he insisted colleges and universities have made “victimhood a coveted status that confers privileges.” For some reason, Will is under the impression that women want to be raped so they can get the goodies that come with it.You know, things like internal injuries, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, post-traumatic stress disorder, invasive medical procedures and an unforgiving legal system that examines your sexual history under a microscope. Those privileges.The allegation is beyond insulting — it’s dangerous. By ignoring the reality of rape in the lives of women (and men), Will assumes they’re faking it for the ?attention.He implies that they can’t be raped because they want it.An average of 60 percent of assaults aren’t reported. Victims don’t need added incentive to hide their ?trauma.Earlier in his career, Will insisted that Anita Hill’s sexual harassment allegations were simply part of the “victimization sweepstakes” that doles out “many prizes,” such as media attention.Again, Will seems to think that women can’t truly be harassed because they want the attention.What he thinks is legitimized by the Washington Post and the Indianapolis Star. What he thinks becomes what some in his (very large) readership think.What he thinks makes it that much harder for victims to come forward, for women to protect themselves, for women to be safe.When given the chance to apologize for his dangerous statements, Will refused.

       "  'body': 'Everyone on the eighth floor of Foster Quad is crying.Freshmen sniffle in the hall, clustered shoulder-to-shoulder outside a dorm room. Inside, a young woman sobs on her bed, too limp and weak to sit up. Friend after friend tries to calm her, but she just wails. She went to a party. Someone gave her a drink that tasted strange. The ambulance is on its way.Her roommate stands nearby, eyes glassy.“I don’t know what to do,” the roommate says, her voice catching. “I watched her all night. I watched her.”IU Police Officer Brad Begeske takes notes in between all of the tears. It’s just past 1 a.m. on his night shift — six hours left.He asks the sick freshman what she remembers about the party, who gave her the drink, anything. But, as she gasps for air, she can hardly speak.“I don’t want this to happen to me,” she says. “Help me. I want this gone.”Begeske looks at the young woman, trying to make eye contact. He needs to assess her condition.“What’s today’s date?” he asks. “Can you tell me who the president of America is?”She can’t answer.***On patrol, officer Begeske witnesses a side of IU that parents rarely see: the wages of overindulgence, appetites leading to trouble, the many ways students can harm each other and themselves.  All of it is real, and all of it is raw.This Saturday in September, Begeske and the other campus cops begin their shifts at 11 p.m. They gather in the squad room at the IU Police Department station on 17th Street.One officer leans back in his seat, eyes closed, singing “Saturday Night” by the Bay City Rollers. A sergeant’s voice, calling out the numbers of their patrol cars, cuts through a mesh of laughter and conversation.“352...53...184...92...”“92 is totaled,” one officer says, interrupting. They’re short on cars tonight.“All right,” the sergeant says, “you can take 53.”Begeske leans against a long desk. He avoids the mountain of paperwork awaiting his attention.“I’ll take 339,” he says. The sergeant tosses the keys across the room, and they land in Begeske’s palm with a ?satisfying clink.Before everyone scatters, the police radio sputters. Possible gunshots at Forest Quad.The chatter stops. Everyone tenses.“That’s you,” another sergeant says, nodding toward Begeske. “Keep your head down.”***Begeske climbs into his cruiser, a 2013 white Dodge Charger, and takes off. As he heads toward Forest, the speedometer hits 60.A few seconds later, the radio crackles again. The possible shots fired amounted to nothing, and he isn’t needed at the scene anymore.The tension evaporates, and Begeske eases up on the gas to patrol the perimeter of campus. He makes his first stop of the night when he sees a blue Chevy Malibu with darkened headlights. When he approaches, the driver explains she’d been in an accident and her lights are broken. He lets her go with a warning.In the field, Begeske isn’t Brad Begeske. He’s badge No. 28, or just 28, except for when his colleagues joke around and call him “B-rad.” When this happens, he sighs.“No one’s called me that since high school,” he says.High school wasn’t long ago — Begeske’s only 25. After growing up in Calumet City, Ill., he applied to IU, earned a criminal justice degree and joined the campus police force soon after. His dad was a cop, so he wanted to be one, too. The job promised something different every day.Tonight, driving through campus, he notices familiar scenes. Drunken students walk with their arms flung over one another’s shoulders, trying not to fall over. Young women in miniskirts totter toward greek parties in heels they don’t seem to know how to wear yet. A young couple clings to each other as they amble, lopsided, down the middle of the street.Everywhere Begeske drives, his Charger draws wary looks. When he pulls up to a noisy Phi Delta Theta party, he lowers his voice.“Watch everyone scramble,” he says.And when they see the Charger, they do.On his way to a call in Teter Quad, Begeske drives by another party, this one at a two-story red house. Students pack the porch, holding red cups, and a booming bass drowns out song ?lyrics.Begeske cocks his head.“We’re probably going to be there later.”***He climbs the stairs to the third floor of Teter, the dorm he called home as an undergrad. He’s responding to a call of a student who’s had too much to drink and is now stationed in a bathroom, throwing up. Again, an ambulance is on the way.“I can do blood, guts, all of that,” Begeske says. “But I hate vomit.”In the bathrooms, he studies a shape slumped against the toilet.“A little too much?” Begeske asks.“A little too much,” the shape ?mumbles.“Hopefully it was something good.”“Jack Daniel’s.”“That’ll do it.”Soon the emergency medical techs show up, slipping their hands into mint green gloves and pulling out a breathalyzer. The freshman blows a 0.13 percent.Begeske writes an illegal consumption ticket and heads back to his car, where he pumps a pocket-sized bottle of hand sanitizer.“Typical Saturday night call.”***Midnight. Begeske stops at the Village Pantry for a Red Bull. Some nights he eats at the IU Health Bloomington Hospital’s food court. It’s open late, and he insists it’s better for him than fast food. Wherever he goes, he sits where he can see the door. It’s a cop thing, he says. All the guys in the department do it.He gets two nights off a week, and one of those is devoted to Sunday football. He doesn’t visit home as often as his family would like.When he gets a chance to call his mom, she always ends the conversation one of two ways.“I love you,” or “Be careful.”***At Foster Quad, where the sick freshman won’t stop crying, her roommate meets Begeske outside. Even before he steps out of the cruiser, she’s standing beside his door. She tells him she thinks her friend was given roofies at a party on the northwest side of campus. She closes her eyes and rests her face in her fingers.“I’m so scared,” she says. “I don’t know what to do.”“Calling us was the right thing to do,” Begekse says.Post-party distress calls don’t faze him. It’s not that he doesn’t care, but after a few years on patrol, he’s used to it. Sexual assaults are harder, but the toughest cases involve children, because they remind Begeske of his two younger sisters and his little brother.Begeske and the roommate ride the elevator to the eighth floor. When the sick freshman sees the uniformed officer at her door, she starts crying again. A friend holds her up from behind, his fingers interlaced with hers as he rocks her gently from side to side.“Please,” her roommate says, trembling now. “You’re going to be okay. You’re safe here.”No one can remember anything about the party or the guy who gave the freshman the drink that her roommate said turned her into a different person. One floormate who was there remembers bits and pieces: ?Average height. Brown hair. Maybe 175 pounds.When the freshman speaks, her voice is thin.“I’m cold.”She doesn’t have the strength to put on a sweatshirt, so her roommate guides her limbs into the sleeves of a Colts pullover. Other officers arrive, followed by the EMTs, who transfer her to a stretcher. As the elevator doors close, she’s still wailing.Begeske and the other cops aren’t finished. Down the hall, another student who went to the same party is also sick. Two of her friends are carrying her to her room, the young woman’s feet dragging across the carpet. Her head lolls.“I’m fine, I’m fine,” she repeats. She’s not fine. In a few minutes, she’ll be headed to the emergency room ?as well.The officers are investigating the new case when Begeske is notified that, on the floor below, a third young woman is displaying similar symptoms. She, too, was at the party.Begeske turns to the roommate of the student whose distress first brought the police to Foster. Can she help them pin down the location of the house? Her brow furrows.“I don’t know the name of the street,” she says, frustrated. “But you could see it from the stadium.”Begeske takes a shot in the dark.“Was it a red house?” he asks.She looks up, ?remembering.“Yeah,” she says. “It was a red house.”***Begeske heads for the house, other officers trailing in their Chargers. He knocks sharply on the front door, eight times.The porch, crowded before, is empty now. The crimson wood at Begeske’s feet is soaked with alcohol. A trash bag, fastened to the porch railing with duct tape, overflows with Natural Light cans.Other cops stand behind Begeske as he waits for someone to answer his knocks. When a resident opens the door, Begeske glimpses a messy kitchen, counters decorated with half-empty handles of liquor. A faint light reveals footprints from where partygoers tracked sticky mess inside.The house is almost deserted now. Begeske ushers three of the roommates who rent the house back onto the porch. The students sit knee-to-knee on a ratty couch, tight-lipped and eyes down. A girl leans against one of the young men’s shoulders.The officers inform the roommates that three young women who attended their party are now at the hospital. They tell them that allegations of date-rape drugs have been circulating. The roommates swear again and again that there are no date-rape drugs in the house and that, as far as they know, no one was drugged at their party.“It’ll be easier for you guys if you cooperate and tell us where any drugs are,” one of the officers says. One roommate mumbles something about weed in a closet downstairs. Another mentions the desk in his room.This time, Begeske pulls on mint green gloves and heads inside. He’s looking for marijuana, roofies — anything. When he returns, he’s confiscated two plastic sandwich bags of marijuana. He nods to another officer.“Hey, can you help me get the rest of the alcohol out of the kitchen?”The officers find no date-rape drugs at the house, ending the investigation. They cite two of the roommates for underage drinking and the other for serving alcohol to minors.Begeske tells the three guys to pour all of the liquor onto the lawn.“Dude, this one’s full,” one of them says wearily, pulling a handle of Jagermeister out of a white plastic bag. He unscrews the top, walks over to the edge of the porch and watches as every dollar of his liquor is wasted.***When the officers leave the red house, it’s almost ?3 a.m.“We’re going to head to the ER,” Begeske says. He wants to check on the freshman from Foster who couldn’t ?stop crying.He lets out a long sigh. The Bears will play tomorrow, and he’s going to get less sleep than usual.At the hospital, he makes his way past several stretchers of other young women swaddled in white blankets in the hall. All of them are passed out, drunk.He gives the nurse the name of the freshman and asks to see her.It was determined at a later date that the young woman had been to the ER but wasn’t administered a blood test.The nurse types for a few seconds and studies her computer screen.“It looks like she’s already been released.”***Only a few hours left on his shift, Begeske spies someone stumbling across a lawn on Union Street, struggling to carry a grill. When Begeske approaches, the young man admits he stole it from a ?nearby house.Begeske handcuffs the thief and asks him to identify himself. The young man fumbles. He can’t remember how to spell his own middle name. He tells the officer he should at least be permitted to return the grill before he goes to jail.“Sir?” he asks as Begeske helps him into the backseat of the Charger.“Yes?”“What happens to me now?”“What happens to you now is you go to jail.”Sitting behind Begeske, the thief worries about the handcuffs.“Do these cuffs have any nickel in them?” he says. “I’m allergic to nickel.”Once he’s released from the confines of the cold metal bracelets at the jail, he examines his wrists for any marks.From the holding cell, he makes Begeske laugh.“I’ve been going to the gym,” he tells another officer patting him down. “Can you tell? Can you feel my ?muscles?”***Past 5 a.m. now, Begeske heads back to the station to tackle his paperwork. He writes more now than he ever did in college.Maybe, just maybe, he’ll be in bed before the sun’s too high.Begeske’s life is not a cop show. As much as he’d like for every loose end to be tied up by the end of the night, it almost never happens. He won’t know if the Malibu driver fixes her headlights. He won’t see the grill thief be released from the holding cell. And he’ll never know what happened to the freshmen girls who cried all night in Foster.It’s nearly impossible to follow up on every call, he says. There isn’t time.Each shift, from 11 at night to 7 in the morning, there is ?always more.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Union Board Body and Mind Committee is hosting a Zombie 5K on Saturday to promote physical health on campus and raise money for Middle Way House in Bloomington.Students are encouraged to dress up as zombies for the Halloween-themed course. Director of the Body and Mind Committee DeAnthony Nelson said the idea for a zombie-themed course came from the TV show “Walking Dead” along with Halloween.“We were thinking how Halloween was coming up and we wanted to have an event for it,” Nelson said. “I looked around at what some other schools have done and thought of the ‘Walking Dead,’ so we incorporated the zombie theme without the violence and killing.”The non-competitive run/walk will take place Saturday in Dunn Meadow. Runners will take off at 5 p.m., and walkers will begin about 10 minutes later.“The main purpose is to have a fundraiser event for Middle Way House within the Body and Mind Committee,” Nelson said. “This will serve our community and be something fun for the students.”Middle Way House is a secure shelter for women and families who are victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.This will be the first 5K Union Board has hosted, Nelson said, adding he hopes it won’t be the last.The Body and Mind Committee is one of several Union Board committees.The committee is dedicated to promoting physical health and wellness and educating IU students about sexual and mental health, nutrition and personal safety.There will be volunteers dressed as zombies and other characters along the course.Nelson said there will also be Halloween decorations and creatures jumping out at participants.The 3.1-mile course will begin at Dunn Meadow and will go through Sample Gates and around Seventh Street, ending back at Dunn Meadow.Immediately following the race is a zombie-themed after party in Dunn Meadow with a costume contest, dance competition, caricatures, free food, games, balloon artists and a rock-climbing wall. The Live From Bloomington Committee is also hosting DJs and the Atomic Dog Brass Band.“This is a service for the community and campus with a bigger focus on health and wellness,” Nelson said. “This promotes physical health — to be active in a 5K and have students on their feet for a long period of time.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Late last week, an Albuquerque woman falsely accused a police officer of sexual harassment.The accusations were dismissed because the officer in question was equipped with a video camera that evening, and the footage in this instance spoke for ?itself.There’s nothing terribly shocking about this incident \\xad— a regular citizen was pulled over for drunk driving, was detained and then lied, I suppose, in order to help her case.But the real crime was the nature of that lie.During the initial traffic stop, the officer overlooked the moment when the woman slipped her cell phone into her bra.Once detained, the woman asked to use the restroom where she used her phone and was allegedly heard inquiring how best to land the officer in hot water.No brainer, just say he sexually assaulted you.The entire operation is pretty despicable, but realistically, and in the heat of the moment, this woman behaved like most people.Think of how many people blatantly lie about being on their phones when they get pulled over.Unfortunately, the woman made a poor choice in feigning sexual abuse and not because the officer was wearing a video camera.Lying about being sexually assaulted may be one of the most vile and dangerous things to do.Faking an instance of being sexually violated cheapens the cries for help from the people who have actually experienced it. It also warps the perception an audience might have as to the rate, circumstance and nature in which sexual assaults occur, which is nothing to joke about.I’m not crazy about cops, but here we have an honest officer attempting to keep the streets safe. Without his camera, he might have seen criminal charges.The assumption that some cops don’t abuse their position would reach beyond naivety and into ?absurdity.But, as with most blanket statements, generalizing law enforcement is less about poor taste and more about accuracy.Take for example the Nevada court marshal who issued a random and unexplained drug search on a woman who was in court for a routine divorce case.The drug search was not in view of cameras or a witness. And while that court marshal has been fired, the investigation is on going.Efforts to keep law ?enforcement in check are expanding, with more and more police officers wearing cameras on the job, instead of just on their ?dashboards.We need more people to be honest: cops, civilians and otherwise. Instead of dissing cops or the public at large, we should encourage a greater sense of accountability among each other and ourselves so that we may mature as a society.If you have a personal problem with police officers, fine. But don’t go exaggerating their behavior for your own sake. That route helps no one in the long run.michoman@indiana .edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Republican Jacob Moore is challenging incumbent Democrat Chris Gaal in the Nov. 4 midterm election to be the next prosecutor in Monroe County.The prosecutor is tasked with promoting the general welfare and safety of residents. They are also responsible for filing charges against individuals. Here’s a look at the two candidates.Chris Gaal (D)Gaal has served as prosecutor since 2006. He has lived in Bloomington for the past 30 years, having attended IU for both his undergraduate degree and Juris Doctor. After law school, he worked as a criminal defense lawyer in Bloomington.Gaal said his experience qualifies him for another term as prosecutor.“This election is about experience and community leadership,” Gaal said. “I’m the experienced candidate with a proven record of community leadership.”Gaal said one of the main focuses of his time as prosecutor is on crime prevention and education. He said his office worked closely with IU on two campaigns, “Get a ride!” to raise awareness on drunk driving and “Got Consent?” to raise awareness on sexual assault.In addition to his education programs, Gaal said he is a capable trial lawyer and has handled high-profile cases.“I’ve done the work; I’ve been effective,” Gaal said. “I’m the experienced candidate with a proven record of community leadership.”Jacob Moore (R)Moore received his J.D. from Texas Tech University School of Law after attending Ball State. After graduating law school in 2009, Moore moved back to Indiana to pursue his legal career.Moore said his experience as a trial lawyer has helped qualify him for the position.He said he believes drug-related crimes should be prosecuted differently from violent offenses.“In some cases, justice is going to be merciful,” Moore said. “If you have a non-violent drug offender, treatment makes much more sense than prison.”Moore also said he believes the county should not prioritize minor consumption cases as much as it currently does.Moore said while he does not encourage underage drinking, he doesn’t believe the county should put too much emphasis on it.“I think that everyone who calls Monroe County home, whether that’s permanent or just for a few years, I think it’s important that everyone has equal access to justice,” Moore said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Flickering candlelight lead the Take Back the Night march down Kirkwood last night to bring awareness to sexual assault.The Feminist Student Association hosted their annual Take Back the Night march with the support of approximately 40 to 50 FSA members and students.Before the march, a diverse group of speakers from organizations such as the Monroe County Prosecutor’s Office, Indiana University Police Department and the Sexual Assault Crisis Center spoke at Dunn Meadow about the importance of sexual assault awareness.“We definitely wanted to get a wide array of viewpoints and as much knowledge as we can put out there,” FSA Co-President Hannah Milner said.Tables from the Kinsey Institute and Student Ethics Board were also set up in Dunn Meadow with information about consent and sexual assault prevention.This year was the first year the FSA displayed t-shirts from the Clothesline Project. The Clothesline Project is a national organization that spreads awareness about violence against women. The FSA provided T-shirts and art supplies for sexual assault victims to express themselves and share their stories.“It’s a therapeutic process for survivors of any form of violence to just express that experience and just get it out of themselves,” FSA treasurer Carmen Vernon said.Creating visual representations on T-shirts served as a form of storytelling without the anxiety of public speaking, Vernon said.FSA members like freshman Chloe Feyock volunteered at the event to set up and organize tables like the Clothesline Project.Since changing their name from the Women’s Student Association to the more inclusive FSA, the group has seen an increase in passionate members, ?Vernon said.“I’ve heard a lot of things about the school, how they don’t seek out people who have been sexually assaulted,” Feyock said. “If we do more of these events then it will get circulation and press and they’ll start noticing that this is a big issue.”Vernon and FSA Director of Activism Morgan Mohr lead the march from Dunn Meadow to the town square with a Take Back the Night banner.The march was more solemn and reflective than past years, with the omission of signs and chants, ?Milner said.This was partly to differentiate Take Back the Night from FSA’s Slut Walk.“This year we want it to have a different feel than Slut Walk did,” Milner said. “It’s more about supporting survivors of sexual assault and raising awareness about that specific issue within our community, especially being on a college campus.”The group gathered at the town square for a survivor speak out, a safe environment for students to speak about their experiences with sexual assault.Several students spoke out about their experiences with sexual assault, receiving warm hugs and encouraging snaps from the group.The Speak Out concluded with Kinsey grad student and sexual assault crisis counselor Shadia Siliman ?speaking about the ?importance of reaching out ?to others.“These events bring up awareness and people are afraid to talk about it,” Feyock said. “As a student, even little stupid things stress me out, but if I was sexually assaulted I couldn’t stay here, I couldn’t succeed.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The NCAA just can’t get a break.Right after it thought the whole Jameis Winston media fiasco around his sexual assault case was finally behind it, news recently came out that both Florida State and campus police in Tallahassee, Fla., may have tried to stall the NCAA’s investigation while it was underway.On top of that, news came out Friday that fellow Heisman hopeful and Georgia running back Todd Gurley is likely to miss the entire season because of a violation of a questionable NCAA rule about autographed memorabilia and possible compensation from that memorabilia.And as recently as Saturday, reports found that the same dealer that sold $400 worth of Todd Gurley-signed memorabilia also authenticated more than 100 Jameis Winston autographs as well.So it’s safe to say the NCAA headquarters isn’t a fun place to be right now.But although the rule about athletes autographing and receiving compensation for their signatures, jerseys and status as a college football player is clearly prohibited, let’s not ignore the fact that it’s a ?ridiculous rule.The players should at least be allowed to receive compensation from their status as players when that money is basically chump change compared to the millions of dollars the NCAA and schools rake in using those same likenesses for promotion and jersey ?sales alone.That said, it’s encouraging that Georgia came out in full support of Gurley in a press release, stating it would fully cover his legal representation and support him as a member of ?the school.“While the university does not tolerate any violation of NCAA rules, the university has supported and continues to support its student-athletes,” it stated Friday.As just one example, when this matter arose, the university offered separate legal counsel to Todd. The university recommended — and Todd retained — counsel with vast experience with eligibility matters, and the university continues to pay for Todd’s counsel, as permitted by NCAA rules.“We have made clear to Todd that regardless of what happens with this case, he is still a member of the Bulldog family, and we will support him in every way ?we can.”It’s not an endorsement of Gurley’s innocence by any means.But it’s refreshing to see a school come out in such staunch support of its student athletes in the face of what many people and fans alike believe he shouldn’t be punished for in the ?first place.And in part, at least, we and athletes have IU to thank for that.In recent years, Athletics Director Fred Glass has helped contribute to a climate of support for the school’s student athletes over support for the increasingly bureaucratic NCAA, perhaps as much as any school official in ?the country.It culminated in a “Bill of Rights” that quantified the value of an education and offered unprecedented support in favor of these ?student athletes.But more than that, it offered a progressive model for other officials across the country to look at ?and emulate.If more schools continue to come out in support of their athletes over their bureaucratic obligations to the Association, it’s going to prove harder and harder for the NCAA to justify keeping those rules around in the first place.We need trendsetters like Glass and the Georgia athletic director to get the ball moving, though, or else we’ll never see that change in the world of ?college athletics.Here’s to hoping that change comes sooner rather than later.aknorth@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': '“Do you know what rush boobs are?” my roommate asked me the other night. She was approached by one of her guy friends who asked her if she would be willing to take a picture of her breasts with his fraternity’s letters painted on them.This appears to be a common promotional strategy used among fraternities at many universities to attract more men to rush greek organizations. Totalfratmove.com has a collection of “rush boobs” dating back two years.It’s also a strategy that exploits women and doesn’t exactly help the image of fraternities at a time when sexual assault controversies are a consistent issue in the media.There are many benefits of joining a fraternity. It gives men a chance to live in an academic community. Men are able to participate in a variety of charitable events. Future business connections and friendships are built. Social events are brought to the members on a regular basis. There is no need to use women’s body parts as a recruiting tool for fraternities.By using women’s breasts as a recruiting tool, fraternities are sending the message, “You will have unlimited access to these boobs if you join our organization.” Men then enter the fraternity expecting to constantly have sexual access to women.That expectation can slowly morph into men thinking they have a right to a woman’s body. This could potentially lead to an increase of sexual assault among fraternity members.Part of being a fraternity member is learning how to be a gentleman around women. However, this sexually exploitive marketing tactic is completely contradictory to fraternal philosophy.It is also important to consider the fact that these fraternity members who take exploitative pictures of women are the same men who some day become our co-workers or bosses. As a woman, it makes me incredibly uncomfortable to think about working with a man who would view my body as a promotional tool for an organization that is supposed to build good character in its members.However, the women who allow their bodies to be used as a promotional tool need to think of consequences as well.These pictures of their breasts are posted online for thousands of men to see. The pictures stay online forever. There are websites specifically designated for “rush boob” advertisements.The women in these photos are our future teachers and CEOs. It is quite possible for the pictures of a woman to be released again by a former fraternity member after she experiences success years down the road. This can be detrimental to her career, especially at a time when more women are becoming leaders.Consistency and integrity are two important characteristics of a stable organization. Fraternities need to start using recruiting tools that are consistent with their philosophies and teachings on how to treat women well.You cannot recruit new members with sexually exploitative pictures of women and then weeks later try to teach pledges how to act like a gentleman toward a lady.Fraternities who use the “rush boob” marketing tactic feel the need to give a sexual incentive to potential members. And they are in need of a serious review of greek life philosophy and purpose.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Sarita Soni said she came to IU with two suitcases and a brain.Soni, who recently retired from her role as associate vice president for research and vice provost for research, was recently awarded the Provost’s Medal in recognition of her service to IU.She earned a doctor of optometry degree from IU in 1976 where she has since filled several positions, including lecturer, professor and associate dean.Soni then accepted the position of IU’s associate vice president for research in 2004 and the position of IU Bloomington’s first vice provost for research in 2006.She said her work in optometry spurred her interest in research.“I was always looking at questions that patients asked me and I’d find answers in either this way or that way,” she said.As the associate vice president for research and vice provost for research, Soni was responsible for overseeing current internal funding programs, developing new external funding sources, overseeing research development services and fostering high quality research, according to the executive vice president for University Academic Affairs’ website.“She was in charge of overseeing the research enterprise of the Bloomington campus,” Jorge José, vice president for research, said. “That includes biological and physical sciences as well as arts and the humanities. She also managed several centers and institutes, including the two museums that we have in the Bloomington campus.”As the associate vice president for research and vice provost for research, Soni championed translational research, collaboration between professors and students and collaboration among researchers.While basic research attempts to understand what happens and why purely for the sake of obtaining that knowledge, translational research attempts to understand what happens and why for the sake of applying that knowledge to real world problems, Soni said.By encouraging collaboration between professors and students, Soni said she hopes students feel more comfortable approaching professors about research.“A lot of students feel that faculty, when they are doing their research, are not engaged with the students,” she said. “And I think that’s a bit of a myth.”Soni said she hopes that a lot of researchers will focus on the few problems spurred by the campus Strategic Plan, which urged faculty to identify and tackle one or two problems, termed grand challenges, per year over the next five years.During the development of the Strategic Plan, Soni said she led a team of 18 researchers, representing the arts and humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and the professional schools, in identifying potential grand challenges.“Over the next five years, I’d be delighted if we come up with four really good ideas that would help our faculty focus, our graduate students focus, our ?undergraduate students focus and get to those points and make an impact,” she said.In honor of Soni’s dedication to transitional research, collaboration between professors and students, collaboration among researchers and the Strategic Plan, Provost Robel awarded Soni the Provost’s Medal, an accolade that recognizes outstanding service that builds and enhances the impact of IU, according to the ?University.“Dr. Soni brought the academic expertise and instincts of a top-ranked researcher in her field as well as the experience of having been the acting dean of a school to her role as vice provost for research,” Robel said in an email.Robel said she hopes the person who fills the role will continue along the path set by Soni.“I feel confident that the person who would be successful at this role will be someone who knows and cherishes our research history and understands and values research in all of the fields represented on the campus,” Robel said.Soni, who said she will chair a faculty student welfare roundtable aimed at tackling the issue of sexual assault, said she hopes the person who fills her role will continue along the trajectory set by the Strategic Plan.“I hope that we will continue to move forward in trying to establish areas of excellence on the Bloomington campus that have a major national and international impact,” she said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Let’s face it. Fraternities have a bad rap on campus, and not ?without cause.Ten Interfratenity Council fraternities on the IU campus are under disciplinary probation for allegations of hazing or alcohol violations, according to the Division of Student Affairs.Two additional ones are ?completely suspended.These pages have already talked at length about the negative consequences of an underground fraternity subculture gone wild, and indeed we have criticized the fraternities on campus for not taking a more active role in stamping it out.However, we are glad to see that we, as in IU fraternities, are avoiding egregious violations, at least.The latest horror story involves the brothers of the Zeta-Zeta chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.Members purportedly used a system of red and black X’s to identify which girls should be roofied, according to the Huffington Post. Rohypnol, more formally known as flunitrazepam and more commonly as roofies, is a common date-rape drug because of its short-term amnesia effects on those taking it.The fraternity brothers allegedly marked the girls they wanted to drug, and the bartender would do so.This is a despicable example of fraternity behavior at its absolute worst and unfortunately lends credence to the idea that these institutions and their members are nothing more than children with power complexes.We know the greek system here on campus can be extremely beneficial if used in the right way, and steps are in place to rehabilitate that image. Last week, IU fraternities took pledges to end sexual violence both within the greek system and on campus.The fraternities released powerful statements about the cause and what they plan on doing to end sexual assault, be it expelling brothers or re-hashing ?intra-fraternity policy. But a lot needs to be done in order to get away from the pervasive stereotypes and the double-secret probations.That leaves us with a very hard choice.With the pervasiveness and ubiquity of parties hosted by the fraternities, going out on a Friday or Saturday night is still very much a caveat emptor proposition.Despite what we may wish to believe about IU, the unfortunate reality, as with many things, is that the bad apples certainly grab up the majority of headlines.But simply dismissing incidents like these fails to address the problem of that insidious culture that we have spoken ad nauseum about, nor do we doubt that this will be the last these pages have to say on the issue.The greek system is not beyond redemption, but the endless choruses calling for change are not done out of malice but genuine concern.We want all organizations to do their good works contributing to the community, whether it is finding students experience, ?leadership or companionship.That is the future we want to see and what all of us at IU should strive for, rather than seeking a quick and dirty way to have fun on weekends.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Forget about brotherhood. Fraternities at Wesleyan University in Connecticut will be going co-ed within the next three years. The school was prompted to make this change in response to the rising amount of sexual assaults among fraternities.While this merging of men and women in the school’s greek systems may be a step toward equality, it also has its complications and sexist implications.Inviting women to join these fraternities was an act to prevent sexual violence, and it might work.However, there is not much proof that this move will actually make fraternities safer. It looks like the school is just trying to put a female Band-Aid over the gaping wound of fraternities.This merge is not a slight accommodation. It will completely change the greek system.The school is basically pressing a reset button to fix the issue of violence in the system.Perhaps the university is inviting women into the fraternities in hopes that men might gain some empathy.The idea behind the policy change makes sense. If they begin to interact with these women on a brotherhood-sisterhood basis, maybe they will see women as human beings instead of purely sexual objects.But allowing women into the fraternities for the purpose of “fixing” sexual violence is not a good reason to finally reset the greek system. Gender equality and safety should have been the goal.Fraternities are hotbeds for dangerous, or at least not-smart, behavior among men.Wesleyan University’s change is based on the idea that women tame and civilize men. Women don’t attend college to babysit fraternity houses. They attend college to be successful in their own lives.There is a chance that this merge might encourage equality among men and women.This may open up a door for men and women to interact more often on an intellectual level.However, given the history of the school’s male fraternity members’ sexual violence, this might simply be risking putting women in an environment where they could be harmed.There are also many logistic complications that come along with this merge. Living arrangements must be discussed.Some fraternity houses might have to be completely renovated. Funds must be raised and organized to accommodate co-ed living areas.New rules have to be established and the rushing process will need to be reconstructed.There are better ways to go about addressing this issue. Just last week, IU’s fraternities took a powerful pledge to end sexual violence on campus.They will begin to closely monitor the actions of their fellow fraternity members and severely punish or expel anyone who appears to be crossing a line.This merge will be complicated and frustrating.It will be a great burden on the new female fraternity member’s shoulders to somehow prevent sexual violence.The school should not expect women to calm fraternity boys down. IU is beginning to make strides in that direction.Weslayan should reconstruct its fraternities to provide environments and education that encourage their boys to be men without throwing the burden on the shoulders of women to teach the pretty simple concept of “no means no.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Sexual assault is a serious problem for college campuses across the country, and IU is no exception.Twenty-one Indiana fraternities have taken a stand and made pledges to stop sexual assault in their houses. Hopefully this will lead to a decrease in assault.There were 22 sexual assaults reported on campus in 2013, according to the 2014 Annual Security report released by the University.This is less than the statistic for 2012, in which 33 sexual assaults were reported, but still too high for comfort. In 2013, collegestats.org listed IU as one of the 12 most dangerous schools for women.Following the disappearance of Lauren Spierer, eyes have been looking at IU to be aware of the dangers to students on campus, but we have seen very little changes for the University.That is one reason this vow by IU fraternities is so welcome.They represent a large social aspect of this University, and with this public vow they are setting a good example and a new standard of expectation from students.Out of 36 fraternities on campus, 21 have pledged to hold themselves and fellow fraternity brothers accountable in order to prevent sexual assault.Most promise expulsion from the fraternity if sexual crimes are committed.Many people believe fraternities are a hotbed for sexual assault. Every freshman girl is warned about which frats have certain reputations, and all party-goers realize a certain risk when attending any large social event where there will be alcohol.A 2007 study found that fraternity men were three times more likely to commit rape, according to CNN.By holding the greek community accountable for itself, it can, in the words of Delta Upsilon’s pledge, “destroy this problem from the root.”This focus on fraternity responsibility is also a nice change from the victim-blaming that is usually present in discussions about rape prevention.Whether or not there is a person willing to commit rape present is the determining factor of a sexual assault, not whether or not a girl is wearing a short skirt.By demanding accountability from their fellow fraternity members, these fraternities would lower the number of people willing to commit sexual assault, which would then lower the number of assaults happening on campus.Despite the positive change these pledges represent, we cannot pretend 21 statements will change the sexual assault pattern on this campus, if that is all they are.Not until these pledges are visibly upheld can we as a community feel comfortable about what is being done to end sexual assault. It is easy to pledge something. It is harder to condemn a friend.Hopefully these vows are taken seriously and will yield positive results.Hopefully they will inspire the remaining 15 fraternities to do the same.At the very least, it is a step in the right direction and 21 steps closer to taking our campus off the “dangerous” list.jordrile@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Yes means yes.These three words, small but mighty, are the backbone for the new sexual assault prevention program unveiled at the University of California-Berkeley.Berkeley is changing the way they frame conversations about sexual assault for new students at their freshman orientation.Conversations about sexual assualt are often framed around rejection-based ?encounters.Rejection-based encounters are when one party is interested in advancing the experience and the other rejects his or her advances.Berkeley staff members are seeking to change the conversation into one of mutual engagement that operates on a basic assumption of equality.“Yes means yes” describes a mentality in which both parties involved in intimacy of any sort do not continue to the next level until both express an explicit desire to proceed.What’s truly revolutionary about this approach is that it actually casts sex in a positive light.Everyone, from sexual assault awareness advocates, the media, Rihanna, you name it, either implies or explicitly states that sex is about domination.One person advances on another person until he or she either says “stop” or doesn’t.Rather than toeing that line, “yes means yes” encourages both people to agree to move forward.They mutally agree to proceed together for a healthy experience or cease the activities at whatever point that “yes” is absent.Of course, I am not asserting that sexual assaults occur simply because the couple failed to clearly communicate, and neither is Berkeley.In fact, California is on the brink of becoming the first state to make affirmative consent its law by passing a new piece of legislation entitled Senate Bill 967.SB 967 would write the definition of consent into the California state ?constitution.It will help condemn those who violate the rules of consent and further defend victims of assault.It would specifically require schools “whose students receive financial aid to uphold an affirmative consent standard in disciplinary hearings and to educate students about the standard,” according to CNN.California’s initiative is the prime example of actions speaking far more loudly than words when it comes to effecting meaningful and lasting change.Unlike President Obama’s new “It’s On Us” campaign, Berkeley’s affirmative consent policy changes the conversation to erase dominant-submissive gender dynamics and make intimacy about equality and ?communication.We cannot stop here.In order to fully reverse the nation’s psychology when it comes to sex and sexual assault, “yes means yes” and other consent awareness programs must be taught in schools’ sex education courses.Students cannot receive a comprehensive sex education if they are not taught how to protect themselves and others alongside reproductive anatomy and ?biology.Obama, take a page out of California’s book.It’s on us to understand that yes means yes.sbkissel@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The greek community is joining in on the national call to action to end hazing through campus initiatives and social campaigns.National Hazing Prevention Week is demonstrated during the last week of September every year. The week is spent spreading awareness in an effort to stop hazing in fraternities, sororities, sports teams and other communities.IU’s Interfraternity Council has started an anti-hazing initiative called Hoosiers Against Hazing, IFC Vice President of Membership Development Sean Ndebele said.“Unfortunately, hazing is part of the fraternity culture across the nation,” Ndebele said. “We want to make sure that’s not happening at our fraternities at IU.”Hoosiers Against Hazing’s ultimate goal is to eradicate hazing in all capacities, Ndebele said.The campaign is new this school year but it plans to follow a similiar model like those of the sexual assault awareness groups such as Safe Sisters and Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault (MARS).The IFC booklet defines hazing as any voluntary or involuntary act that may degrade, intimidate or harass an individual physically, mentally, emotionally or psychologically.The punishment for reported instances of hazing is chapter suspension. Hazing or other bias misconduct can be reported to the Office of Student Ethics or Student Life and Learning, according to the Culture of Care website.Greek members can also go to the IFC and Panhellenic Association membership development or risk management chairs as a resource.Both the IFC and Panhellenic Association chairs do not have jurisdiction, though, because hazing is viewed as a crime, Ndebele said.As part of the Hoosiers Against Hazing initiative, the IFC has given chapter presidents an anti-hazing oath to distribute among their members.The oath is based off the National Hazing Prevention pledge but has been edited to be greek specific, Ndebele said.The oath reads, “As a fraternity man and member of the community, I am vowing to prevent hazing before it occurs, stop hazing when I see it happening and help empower others to do the same in their organizations, schools and communities.”The Panhellenic Association addressed National Hazing Prevention Week with a social media campaign through their Twitter account, @IUBPHA.Abby Kloberdanz is a sophomore in Phi Mu sorority who participated in the twitter campaign.“We think sisterhood is so important, we can’t imagine doing anything to harm at all,” Kloberdanz said. “The sisterhood is top priority.”The account spread awareness through the hashtag “Be the Change”, urging sororities to take a pledge against hazing.Individual sorority Twitter accounts such as Gamma Phi Beta, Alpha Omioron Pi and Phi Mu posted pictures of sisters with signs that read, “pledges against hazing” as part of the campaign.“I don’t think joining a house should have anything to do with harming others,” Kloberdanz said. “You’re joining to be sisters or brothers.”The first Hoosiers Against Hazing seminar will be Oct. 6, with an expected 200 fraternity members present. Hoosiers Against Hazing plans to hold assemblies one to two times a semester, Ndebele said.“Hazing is something that’s been going on in America for decades,” Ndebele said. “I think as a society we’ve turned a blind eye to it for too long.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Interfraternity Council’s new group, Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault, is trying to redirect the conversation on sexual assault.MARS’ efforts are geared toward framing the issue of sexual assault as affecting more than just the victims, but an issue that affects the greek and campus communities as a whole.IFC Vice President of Membership Development Sean Ndebele said MARS has grown exponentially this year, with nearly 300 men now part of the group.This is compared to the initial 50 to 60 fraternity members who were interested in joining the group this past year when the group was started by IU alumnus Grant Ryan.Similar to the Panhellenic Association’s Safe Sisters program, MARS members will be trained by IU staff from Counseling and Psychological Services and Sexual Assault Crisis Services and will also comprise of representatives from all 33 fraternity chapters on ?campus.MARS will use discussion-based presentations during its larger meetings twice a semester with the hope that MARS men will bring this information back to their chapters, Ndebele said.Spreading awareness within the chapters will be the biggest challenge, ?Ndebele said.“Nobody really wants to talk about an issue like this,” Ndebele said. “But it has to be discussed if we’re going to do something about it. It’s tough to get into, but once you get guys’ heads straight, the conversation goes a little smoother. We’d rather talk about it now than have to talk about it because we have to because something has happened in a chapter.”MARS’ sexual assault awareness stresses bystander prevention and changing the culture within chapters. SACS Outreach Coordinator Mark Houlemarde addresses this by deconstructing masculinity and the language centered on sexual assault.Specifically, Houlemarde focuses on suggestive phrases and their undertones, as well as men assuming consent instead of asking their partner for it.“For me, there is more of an interest in talking to men,” Houlemarde said. “The conversation has really always been about women protecting themselves versus men thinking about how (they) can step in and even stop themselves from having non-consensual sex.”The idea of having a male-focused sexual assault prevention program is not new to IU, Houlemarde said.  In previous years the group was called FRAT, Fraternities Reducing Assault ?Together.Houlemarde said this group didn’t have a clear idea of what its goals were and, therefore, didn’t gain much traction.Former Director of Fraternity and Sorority Life Michael Goodman suggested that the issue of sexual assault in greek life be readdressed when Ryan founded MARS.While MARS does receive some support from organizations CAPS, SACS and Student Life and Learning, it is largely student run and could benefit from more institutional backing, Houlemarde said.“Now we’re reliant on student leaders to help carry MARS forward,” Houlemarde said. “Their ideas are what drives the ?future of MARS.”Right now, the 300 men that have shown an apparent interest in MARS don’t have a clear definition of membership or ?responsibility.MARS plans to reach out to and model itself after Safe Sisters.Safe Sisters is a program that assists sororities in creating a climate where it is safe to speak on sexual ?violence.Safe Sisters are trained by SACS counselors to suggest support choices for a victim, as well as other aspects of counseling for victims.Ndebele attended the Safe Sisters training to receive feedback from the ?sorority members.“As fraternities, we don’t want our women coming to our organizations and being in fear,” Ndebele said. “We want them to feel as safe as possible. My goal is to go there (Safe Sisters) and find out how we can do that.”Creating a safe environment translates into fraternity members stepping in when a student is too intoxicated or pushy.It also means avoiding party themes that might require suggestive clothing, Ndebele said.MARS also focuses on the stigma of sexual assault in the greek community.Statistically speaking, there are more instances of sexual violence reported within the greek community than outside of it, Houlemarde said.However, there is no way of knowing if this is a result of more sexual assault cases, better reporting or both, Houlemarde said.“A lot of people just assume that rape and sexual assault are just rampant throughout (greek life),” Ndebele said. “Really, I think we’re just like the general community. There’s always going to be those one or two rotten apples. When you have so many people, it’s hard to have a perfect community.”For fraternity members such as Grant Schultz, a junior in Sigma Alpha Epsilon, sexual assault awareness is a larger communal and ?societal issue.“It is the duty of every student at IU to help prevent it,” Schultz said in an email. “Sexual assault is a tragedy, regardless of where it occurs. Every student at IU must take a stand by making it a personal goal to prevent sexual assault.”MARS will bring its sexual assault prevention and education to the IU community through events and awareness programs.MARS will sponsor a table discussion Wednesday near the Woodburn clock tower in order to reach out to students and will be distributing T-shirts and information regarding prevention, Ndebele said.MARS is a step in the right direction to overcoming the stigmas often associated with the greek ?community, Ndebele said.\"(We want) to help people see that we’re not sitting back in the back burner looking at this issue,” he added. “We’re definitely trying to address it.”',\n",

Pepper was called out for sexual harassment.Fellow YouTubers took to social media to express their disappointment in their ?colleague.The hashtag “Report Sam Pepper” popped up on ?Twitter.A second video was released in which a female friend of Pepper uses the trick to pinch men’s butts.The two videos were ?removed from YouTube.On Sept. 23 Pepper released a video of him addressing the backlash concerning the videos, and it wasn’t what I was expecting.Pepper called the videos a “social experiment.”He claimed both videos were staged and scripted and, though I never saw the original videos on YouTube, the versions he uploaded on Facebook contained the same disclaimer at the end.Pepper made the videos looking for a certain reaction, and he got it. He was happy to see people upset by his blatant acts of sexual harassment.“I’m happy that I live in a society where the honor of a woman is protected at all costs,” Pepper said in the video.But it’s not only women who face harassment and abuse, and the true purpose of the series highlights that.People have different reactions to the harassment of women as opposed to the harassment of men.In the example of the videos, reactions to the women’s video were far more outraged than those to the men’s.As a society, we’ve created a misconception that men cannot be abused. Not because what happens to them isn’t, in fact, abuse, but that we shouldn’t call what happens to them abuse ?because they are men.They are supposed to be strong and macho. They should just suck it up and get past it. It’s not a big deal.They need to be men about it.The reality is that 835,000 men are abused annually in the United States, according to National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.They’ve also found that one in 33 men has been the victim of attempted or completed rape and one in six boys is abused by the age ?of 16.Pepper himself has been sexually harassed. In his video he spoke of his fans at several events pinching his butt and laughing it off when he expressed his discomfort.This also sheds light on the way people treat celebrities. We get the idea that just because we listen to their music or watch them on TV every week that we know them, and the truth is that we don’t.Most importantly, they do not know us. You are a stranger and have no right to touch them or anyone, famous or not, without their permission.Pepper brought up a number of great social points through this ?sequence of videos.He perhaps didn’t execute it in the best way, but his intentions were valid and important, and we needed to be made aware of them.lnbanks@indiana.edu',\n",

It also indicates the rankings are functionally meaningless.Because landing on U.S. News’ top 25 list can increase the number of applications to a school anywhere from 6 to 10 percent, some American colleges and universities are desperate to move up in rankings by any means ?necessary.These Machiavellian maneuverings range from simply lying — most of the statistics used to determine U.S. News’ rankings are self-reported — to awkwardly rearranging administrative practices to look more ?prestigious on paper.As early as 2000, highly ranked colleges have admitted to inflating freshman SAT scores, class rank and ?rejection rates.Capping classes at 19 instead of 20, making applying easier so rejection rates soar, keeping less-than-stellar students away from campus in the fall so they’re not included in ranking data — oh, and straight-up lobbying U.S. News — launched Northeastern University from 162nd in 1996 to 49th in 2013.Instead of actually trying, some schools just play the system.The rankings are even more meaningless when we consider what statistics aren’t included.The U.S. News and World Report rankings can’t tell you how many Title IX complaints have been filed against the university.It can’t tell you how safe students feel. It can’t even guarantee the safety data it does provide is accurate, telling students to figure it out themselves.Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., has pushed the ?publication to make sexual assault data more integral to rankings, but it is unlikely to make a difference. Universities are already lying.And yet we still hold our breath when the new ?rankings come out.Kids and parents still rely on these lists to make decisions about higher education. Current students delight in discovering where their school landed, especially on the list of party schools. Newspapers across the country report on them.Purdue beat IU overall (62 to 76), and both schools are good for veterans.The Atlantic’s John Tierney insists students just ignore rankings. Vox’s Libby Nelson suggests schools just stop providing data and go on their merry way.But students, especially those who can’t afford to go on college visits, need this kind of data aggregation to make an informed decision about their future. And as long as students need U.S. News’ rankings, colleges will attempt to manipulate them.The ideal solution would be an unbiased ranking system that collects its own data independent of universities.Students would still have access to a valuable resource. New measures could be ?easily included.Colleges couldn’t lie so easily.Manipulation might still occur, but could be limited if connected to disincentives, such as cuts in federal ?funding.The Obama administration is in the process of developing a system along these lines but is receiving pushback for considering job outcomes and threatening minority and low-income enrollment.With no viable ranking system to turn to, prospective students’ best bet might be to pin the names of their could-be colleges on a dart board, close their eyes and throw.casefarr@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Instances of violence against women have dominated the news media since Ray Rice’s horrible crimes came to light.From photoshopped Cover Girl advertisements to calls for various NFL officials’ resignations, this issue has nearly eclipsed all else of late.The popularity of this topic received presidential recognition Friday when the Obama administration unveiled its new campaign to end sexual violence on college campuses, titled “It’s On Us.”Although I naturally admire President Obama’s intentions, I resent his habitual strategy to talk big talk but walk zero walk when it comes to effectively addressing and preventing sexual violence.Obama has not declared a legislative campaign to more strictly define rape and assault or increased punishments for those who perpetrate these crimes.He has simply declared yet another social campaign, the substance of which is merely flashy new websites and earnest, celebrity-packed public service ?announcements.It’s great, but it’s not what’s really needed.ItsOnUs.org, a new website featuring tips for sexual assault prevention and a video of celebrities, declares that “it’s on us” to prevent sexual violence.Details surrounding the campaign’s launch, however, suggest otherwise.“It’s On Us” is the product of a task force that was called together in April to address four central goals: “identifying the problem on campuses, engaging men in prevention measures, effectively responding to assault where it’s reported, and increasing transparency in the federal government’s effort to enforce laws and respond to sexual assault cases.”Although this language appears as only the second priority on the above list, engaging men in prevention measures was heavily emphasized during the ?campaign’s unveiling.Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden alluded to the Ray Rice scandal when urging programs which foster role models for young boys — such as the athletic industry — to accept their responsibility to set a good example.Officials attempted to stress that the campaign was “inclusive,” but that sentiment quickly pales in light of Biden’s comment: “So the guys out there who are watching this on television: step up.”Domestic violence and sexual assault stem from sentiments of dramatic physical inequality: the strong feel compelled, even entitled, to dominate the weak for the strong’s own sake.It is infuriating, therefore, to see Obama attempt to remedy this enormously complex issue by endorsing the theme of inequality and assigning blame exclusively to men.It was clear this was the manner in which Obama intended to handle sexual assault when he made highly gendered comments in ?January.“We can do more to make sure that every young man out there, whether they’re in junior high or high school or college or beyond, understand what’s expected of them and what it means to be a man and to intervene if they see somebody else acting inappropriately,” he said.“It’s On Us” is a slogan meant to involve every citizen nationwide and compel them to realize their roles in preventing sexual assault.The campaign cannot be successful if Obama chooses to negate that sentiment by explicitly placing sole blame on the shoulders of young men.The industries, organizations, media outlets, movements, individuals and camps of thought that are to blame for rampant sexual assault and domestic violence across the nation are ?innumerable.All of the aforementioned cannot be assuaged if the federal government has decided it’s easier to blame an entire gender, make a succinct TV ad and hope that does the trick.It will take far more than a contradictory social campaign to turn society around.sbkissel@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'A new group is working to address sexual assault in the greek community.Safe Sisters is a Panhellenic group that will train representatives from each IU sorority chapter Sunday through the Sexual Assault Crisis service on campus in order to serve as a resource for sisters on the issue of sexual assault.Safe Sisters strives to be a resource for sexual assault victims as well as educators of prevention practices, said Olivia Koufos, vice president of personal development for the Panhellenic Association.The group is composed of representatives from each chapter who receive training from SACS and attend monthly meetings through Safe Sisters. These representatives are usually sophomores who demonstrate sensitivity, approachability and problem-solving skills, Koufos said.Interest in being a Safe Sisters representative has grown substantially within the past year, Director of Safe Sisters Margaret Hensley said. This year a limit of four members per chapter has been implemented because of the demand.Members of Safe Sisters will also bring a presentation back to their chapters after their initial training to further educate their sisters and make themselves available as a resource, Hensley said.The SACS training focuses on sexual assault specifically within the greek community, addressing ?issues such as pair parties, social standing and how to respond if a sexual assault is reported within the chapter, said Ann Skirvin, Sexual Assault Crisis Service ?counselor.“We’re wanting to teach them to see their own power in those situations and value themselves and their participation in events and understand that that is valued by the men, as well,” Skirvin said.The training lasts approximately three to four hours and specifies avoiding certain theme parties that may put sorority sisters at risk based on the theme attire recommended, Skirvin said.“We give them skills to be assertive and give them agency to ask questions and think through what’s best for the women in their sorority and value that as much or more than what they’re being asked to do by the men in the fraternities that are inviting them to attend parties,” Skirvin said.Safe Sisters also addresses public perceptions about sorority women, Koufos said.For example, they will look at the perception of sorority women on social media through Facebook groups such as “Slap a Bitch Sorority,” “I Hate Sluts” and “Sorostitutes, Give Them Beer.”In addition to online examples, SACS also discusses the conceptual spectrum of sexual harassment from street harassment to acts of sexual violence, Skirvin said. These situations often strike a chord with the participants, Koufos said.“I think in some sense it’s appalling (to them) that this stuff does happen and that we need to make a change,” Koufos said. “I feel like after they go through the training, it leaves the Safe Sisters feeling really empowered to go back to their chapters and help their members really fight through these situations and help defend them.”The implications of Title IX will also be addressed this semester, Skirvin said.“We’ll be asking them what their impressions are of the climate on campus,” Skirvin said. “What they think can be done in their own organizations and in the greek community at large to improve and make safer party practices for those who choose to attend parties. We’re always challenging them to be thinking, ‘How can things ?get better?’”This year, Safe Sisters plans to utilize campus resources and reach out to groups such as the Protective Order Project, Crimson Corps, Student Ethics and Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault, Koufos said.The group hopes not only to expand throughout all 22 Panhellenic chapters but to have a presence on campus, as well. During Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April, Safe Sisters hopes to host weekly events to educate students, Koufos said.“I would like to see Safe Sisters continue to go down the path that it has been to be supportive and strong and taken seriously, as well as all Panhellenic groups fight for training and education for the greek community as a whole,” Koufos said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Our University is finally updating its approach to sexual assault, but our state is stuck in the dark ages.Despite one-third of Americans having experienced some type of intimate partner violence in their lifetimes, the Indiana criminal justice system remains criminally unprepared for this type of case.Last week, a Brown County woman finally escaped her abusive husband, who forced her to sign a “sex slave” contract and brainwashed her into believing she was “his property and slave.” Several opportunities to stop the abuse were missed, according to court records cited in the Indianapolis Star.Once, responding to the battered woman’s screams, neighbors called the landlord to get their noisy neighbors to shut up.In another case, the police were called, but the officers failed to separate the terrified woman from her abuser when taking statements. It wasn’t until the police were called again that her abuser was finally taken into custody.The third time isn’t particularly charming when a person’s life and safety is at risk.The Indiana Law Enforcement Academy requires eight hours of domestic violence and sexual assault training for anyone interested in becoming an Indiana police officer.These officers must have missed that day. Their negligence cost this poor woman weeks of misery and abuse.Domestic violence often looks different from other types of violence.It can take years for abused partners to admit they have been abused and even longer to seek help. By then, it might be too late.And it’s not just a civilian problem. The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department lost one of its own to intimate partner violence earlier this year.Our court system has a similarly terrible record. In May, an Indianapolis man who drugged and raped his wife for three years was sentenced to absolutely no prison time, despite prosecutors demanding 40 years. He said he drugged her because “she was snippy.”If that weren’t appalling enough, Judge Kurt Eisgruber, who is running for re-election in November, asked the victim to forgive her rapist “because he’s obviously struggled with this.”Eisgruber failed to provide a reason as to why the convicted rapist received no jail time.It should be noted that marital rape has only been a crime in the United States since 1993, according to the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network.Indiana courts and police have to do better.Rookies shouldn’t be the only police officers subject to domestic violence and sexual assault training. Everyone on the force should be required to attend regular seminars about the best ways to help victims of intimate partner violence.The ILEA is already in a partnership with the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Indiana Coalition Against Sexual Assault.Find ways to make this partnership stronger, and ask these organizations what recommendations they have to make the force better-equipped to handle these cases.Judges should also be expected to understand the psychology behind intimate partner violence so they can make informed decisions about the cases they hear. Eisgruber should be voted out of office.The Indiana Daily Student Editorial Board shouldn’t understand intimate partner violence better than the Indiana criminal justice system.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Bloomington’s Middle Way House volunteers like Tempestt Walker aren’t allowed beyond the large set of double doors marked, “secured entrance only.”This sign is on the doors at the end of a long orange hallway – a hallway that secures the women and children who are victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Tempestt has never met any of the women, even though she has volunteered at the house since February 2013. She simply types their names into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and files their court documents.“We call them survivors,” she says.Tempestt is a sort of survivor herself. A senior first-generation college student, she plans to graduate in May with a degree in public health. Tempestt, along with nearly 2,200 other students at IU, is the first in her family to attend college. Neither her mother, father, nor three older siblings successfully completed higher education. She says a lot of students like her struggle to remain in school long enough to graduate. They often succumb to intense academic demands of college-level courses, financial strains, or social pressures.“At first, we’re scared to ask for help,” Tempestt says. “Everyone automatically assumes that you know what to do. You made it here, so you should have the work ethic and you know how to succeed in college. When actually you don’t. You’re going to struggle.”IU students across the state face an alarmingly low graduation rate – 57 percent – for those who enrolled in 2006 and received a degree in six years or less, according to graduation rates published by the University Institutional Research and Reporting office. From the same group, only 35 percent of bachelor’s degree-seeking students graduated in four years. Mary Tourner, director of Groups, an advising and financial aid support program for first-generation college students, says it is more difficult to keep students in school due to familial and financial burdens. The graduation rate of first-generation college students is even less than the University-wide statistic. Mary says it is somewhere around 40 percent.“These students come to campus with the odds against them,” she says.***Tempestt is from Indianapolis, a hotbed of recruitment for first-generation college students. She’s soft-spoken yet determined, and she knows what she wants. The 21-year-old blends into the mass of students studying at Herman B Wells Library with her blue checkered scarf and pink North Face jacket. She will graduate, and nothing will stop her, she says. Her mom always stressed the importance of education, yet her older siblings managed to avoid college. Her oldest brother left high school for the streets.“He felt like he was making enough money on the streets, so he never went back to school,” Tempestt says. Her older brother and sister both received GEDs but haven’t found the time to finish college while working full-time. Tempestt says negative influences like drugs and alcohol never got in the way of her pursuing a college degree.“I see a lot of people back home that struggle — family and friends. I saw college as an opportunity to not be like that. I’m here (in college) for a purpose – to get exactly where I want to go.”In fact, Tempestt has never let her academics fall short. Her determination was tested during her sophomore year when her 2003 Pontiac Grand Am broke down – limiting her transportation to and from class. She lived far enough away from campus to where it made it harder to balance classes and work. She thought for a moment about taking a semester off to save up for a new car.“Taking a semester off meant I may never come back,” she says.So she stayed.She stayed so she can graduate and become a lawyer to help victims of sexual assault like the ones at the Middle Way House.She stayed so she could support her family back home.***Juan Cano, codirector of multicultural outreach recruitment at the IU Admissions office, sits at a small desk in the corner of an upstairs room. This is only one of three jobs he uses to support himself while at school. Currently in his fifth year, Juan plans to graduate in May and attend graduate school for education. He says dealing with the social adjustment of college was the least of his problems as a first-generation college student.“Dealing with the life going on back home was hardest for me,” Juan says, sitting back in his plastic rolling chair. “I had to become the provider for my family.”Juan’s father started calling, asking for money when his bank account filled with thousands in scholarship funds from the 21st Century Scholars program and Groups. Then, Juan’s uncle, the same uncle who cried over the phone when he found out his nephew was going to college, asked for his help financing treatment for kidney cancer.“It really burdens you,” Juan says.But Juan is happy with his role as the provider. He wants to make sure more high school students have the opportunity to be the first in their families to get a college degree. He smiles as he talks about giving his SAT prep books to his younger brother, a junior in high school.Giving high school students access to a higher education hasn’t been the problem for IU. In Indianapolis, the majority of Ben Davis High School’s student body is composed of first-generation students. IU offer thousands of dollars in financial aid specifically for first-generation students. Yet, less than half of the first-generation class of 2014 will receive diplomas come May.Martin McCrory, vice provost for educational inclusion and diversity, has worked at the University for almost two decades, focusing the majority of his effort on improving the environment for first-generation college students. A first-generation student himself, he knows first-hand the obstacles they face.“They never unpack their suitcases because they’re always traveling back and forth from home on the weekends,” Martin says. “This isn’t home for them. This is a foreign land.”The “suitcase kids,” as Martin calls them, are alienated on campus. He and his staff at the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Multicultural Affairs are teaming up with leaders and offices around IU to help make students feel more at home, and more likely to stay and graduate. Martin leads regular focus groups that work to break the barrier between the administration and student body.“It’s my goal to make you believe that you are somebody – that this is your home and you deserve to be at IU,” Martin says.He says his job is what keeps him awake at night, thinking about ways to create more opportunities for students that need help.“I’ll create them,” Martin says. “Or I’ll die trying.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'I was browsing the news when I stumbled upon a three-month old article in the Washington Post about sexual assault on college campuses.The story, written by George F. Will, seemed critical of how colleges have become hypersensitive to the idea of “victims” and are branding people as victims too much.I read a column by Jeffrey Toobin called “Wife-beating is not a private matter.” Toobin gives two cases of domestic violence where the men who beat up their wives do not receive any significant legal punishments.My initial response to both was immediate repulsion.But the more I thought about the two together, the more unsettled I felt about their arguments, since they both seemed so eager to give the victims of each crime overt amounts of individual agency, ignoring the fact that most victims of violent crimes are not the ones to blame for said violence.Will gives an example of sexual assault taken from a Philadelphia Magazine report about Swarthmore College, where a woman reported she’d been raped six weeks after an unwanted sexual encounter in which her ex-boyfriend insisted she have sex with him until she relented.It was apparent Will was skeptical about such cases of reported rape.He argued that “academia is learning ... to create victim-free campuses — by making everyone hypersensitive, even delusional, about ?victimizations.”Toobin said he is dissatisfied with how the aggressors of domestic violence served such little legal consequences.He argues, “When husbands beat up their wives, that is not a matter that should be resolved within the family. It is a crime to be resolved by the legal system.”He said he firmly believes that “it’s not up to victims to decide whether their husbands should be prosecuted. Abusers damage the community, not just the women they assault.”Indeed, the rape case Will brought up is not what people imagine the actual crime to be.But if the victim perceived it as non-consensual there is no delusion or hypersensitivity here to the idea of victimization. The woman was clearly a victim.When Toobin said domestic violence damages the community, he is neglecting the real victim — the actual sufferers of the abuse.If it is really not up to the victim how his or her abuser is to be punished, especially when it is his or her spouse and family, then this seems unjust. By leaving matters completely up to the legal system, the victim has no say — no agency.Both men argue that in each situation, the victim has copious amounts of individual choice, that they choose to stay with their abusers or rapists, that they allow these things to happen.These ideas are wrong in more ways than I can count, and we need to stop these damaging conceptions of ?victimization.To blame them for wanting to bring their abusers to justice is simply not OK.Battered women are not byproducts of an abuser’s or rapist’s own personal problems. They are wholly individual, wholly separate people who need to be able to speak.In some cases, we cannot change what has already occurred. However, one is always entitled to autonomy.nywu@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'IU’s efforts to do more to protect the victims of sexual assault and ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice are praiseworthy. But in this effort, IU must be careful to not victimize innocent people.The Barack Obama regime has been pushing universities to embrace a clearly illegal “preponderance of the evidence” standard in university disciplinary procedures regarding sexual assault.The traditional standard abandoned by the Obama regime is that guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.See this statement from Cornell University’s law school on the importance of the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard.“The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, ’(protect) the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.’The reasonable doubt standard plays a vital role in the American scheme of criminal procedure.It is a prime instrument for reducing the risk of convictions resting on factual error.”Sexual assault is terrible, but the fact of the matter is that false reports do happen.The two most obvious examples are Tawana Brawley and Crystal Gail Mangum, but we saw this locally when a 19-year-old IU student fabricated a kidnapping and “rape” in March 2007. According to the March 30, 2007, Herald-Times, she recanted her story and admitted that she “engaged in consensual sex with a man at a local motel.”What if she had not recanted her story and an innocent man had been criminally prosecuted for a crime that never happened? What if the falsely accused man was another student subjected to university discipline for a crime that never happened?It does no good to anyone to abandon due process in the interest of protecting victims, and as a state institution, IU is not permitted to use the illegal “preponderance of the evidence” standard. IU has a moral and legal obligation to disobey the Obama regime’s clearly illegal mandate.The mark of a true patriot is to stand against the Obama regime’s efforts to take away students’ rights under the Constitution.Scott Tibbsscott@sstibbs.com',\n",

       "  'body': 'You know the statistic: one in five women are raped or are the victims of attempted rape while in college.But it’s still just a number. It can’t tell you what it’s like to be the one in five.But Emma Sulkowicz can.Sulkowicz said she was raped the first day of her sophomore year at ?Columbia University in New York City.She filed a complaint with the university, but her case was dismissed.Two years later, her alleged rapist is still on campus, and Sulkowicz, a visual arts major, has just started her senior thesis. It is a performance piece tentatively called either “Mattress Performance” or “Carry that Weight.”The piece is simple: Sulkowicz will carry around a twin mattress until she no longer attends the same school as her rapist. She is not allowed to ask for help carrying the mattress but can ?accept help if offered.It’s a compelling visual approximation of what being a college sexual ?assault survivor is like.When describing the aftermath of her own sexual assault in an interview with the Columbia Spectator, Sulkowicz said, “I feel like I’ve carried the weight of what happened there with me everywhere since then.”It’s a common feeling.Sexual assault survivors are much more likely to suffer from mental health problems such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.Survivors are also 26 times more likely to use drugs and four times more likely to be suicidal, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National ?Network.Beds are one of our most intimate spaces, but during her sexual assault investigation, Sulkowicz found herself repeatedly “telling people what happened in that most intimate and private space and bringing it out into the light.”Rape or sexual assault isn’t just one night — it’s hundreds of nights, shared over and over with friends, family, police, lawyers, academic misconduct panels, administrators, judges.And even after baring all, you feel isolated.One of the most poignant aspects of Sulkowicz’s piece is that she cannot ask for help, but she can accept it.Sexual assault is a burden on all, but we make survivors carry the heaviest load.IU is famous for its Culture of Care initiative, which encourages community members to listen and to support each other, to step in when help is needed.It is directly opposed rape culture, which claimes men can’t control their urges, that laughs at jokes about rape victims, that wonders if maybe she was asking for it, that has allowed 1 in 5 women to be victimized.Every person that helps Sulkowicz carry her mattress is another person who defies rape culture in favor of a culture of care.With support, it’s not so difficult to carry after all.The IU administration’s approach to sexual assault has improved substantially, but administrative changes alone won’t change the campus culture.It’s up to the rest of us to carry that weight.',\n",

       "  'body': 'IU is implementing system-wide changes to sexual violence policies, procedures and prevention efforts in response to recent federal guidance from the United States Department of Education.The new changes, including the removal of students from hearing panels for appealed sexual assault cases, are taking place amid an Office of Civil Rights investigation into the University’s compliance with Title IX sexual harassment and sexual violence policies.The review, which began in March, seeks to determine if the University has responded promptly and effectively to complaints of sexual violence, according to an DOE spokesman.For the last several months, the University has been providing the Office of Civil Rights with documents and information about its sexual assault reporting procedures, prevention efforts, and victim support resources.Representatives from the office will be on the Bloomington campus from Sept. 8 to Sept. 12 and are inviting students to attend focus groups gauging their awareness of IU’s Title IX-related policies, procedures and resources.“I’m actually really excited,” said Jason Casares, associate dean of students and director of the Office of Student Ethics. “I know some folks are fearful of it, but I think we’re doing great stuff here.”According to records obtained by the Indiana Daily Student, the Office of Student Ethics adjudicated 67 reports of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment from July 1, 2011, through Dec. 31, 2013. The spring 2014 data have not yet been released.Following new guidance suggested by the Office of Civil Rights in April, the University made the decision to alter the process for hearing appealed sexual assault cases on campus. Previously, when a student appealed a decision in the Office of Student Ethics, a review board would hear the appeal. The panel would have included an appointed faculty member, staff member and a student from the IU Student Association Supreme Court. But according to new guidance from the Office of Civil Rights, IU is discouraged from allowing students to serve on hearing boards in cases involving allegations of sexual violence.Going forward, appealed cases will be heard by the respective student affairs professional on each IU campus: Dean of Students Harold “Pete” Goldsmith at IU-Bloomington, for example.Title IX guidance also contributed to the University’s decision to rearrange its Deputy Title IX coordinator roles, said Emily Springston, IU’s Student Welfare Compliance coordinator.The IU Athletics department has never handled its own sexual assault cases, but Executive Associate Athletics Director Julie Cromer previously served as one of IU-Bloomington’s Deputy Title IX Coordinators, Springston said. The University has decided that Cromer will no longer carry the title in order to keep athletics separate from the sexual assault reporting process and clarify that all athletes must work through the Office of Student Ethics. The Office of Student Ethics has also increased the pool of professional staff available to sit on hearing panels for sexual assault cases from 19 people last year to 30 this year, boosting training hours to a total of almost 50 hours, Casares said.In all of its policy changes, the University has rewritten its procedures to encompass the IU system as a whole, Casares said. Previously, each campus had its own process and procedure for managing sexual violence cases.“Now we have one system, one procedure,” Casares said. “It’s really going to help us create the ability to be consistent across the system.”The leading effort in these system-wide changes has taken place through the newly founded Student Welfare Initiative, which aims to coordinate and boost sexual assault prevention and response efforts across the seven campuses.The initiative, comprised of several committees and councils, has begun a public awareness campaign, putting up sexual assault prevention posters in buildings across campus. It also launched a new website last month to provide a single access point for information about sexual assault and campus resources.On the new website, http://stopsexualviolence.iu.edu,We can put this information in a pull-out box the University has written an expanded definition of consent, clarifying “not just what consent is, but what consent is not,” Casares said.Springston said she feels IU is a leader nationally in the way it manages its sexual assault procedures, but she expects the Office of Civil Rights will make recommendations for further improvements.“No one wants to say we’ve got this and it’s perfect.” Springston said.Rachel Green, senior advisor for Culture of Care, is a student representative on the Executive Committee for the Student Welfare Initiative.Green said that although IU’s system compares very well to other universities, she would like to see changes within the judicial process to make it more “survivor-friendly.” She hopes conversations will take place about how to minimize the trauma for students reporting sexual assaults and improve hearing panel training to avoid victim blaming.“It’s overwhelming,” Green said about the judicial process. “It’s a really big decision for a survivor to report a sexual assault.”She thinks surveying students about their understanding of consent, response procedures and resources on campus is the first step in identifying gaps in awareness. Such insight may soon be possible through a campus climate survey planned for later this fall through the Student Welfare Initiative, Springston said.Any conversation among students and faculty about preventing sexual assault is a valuable one, Green said.“Until there’s no more sexual assaults on campus, there’s room for improvement,” Green said.OCR focus groups and office hours scheduleWeek of September 8-12Monday1 p.m. Hoosier Room in IMU: Male Graduate Student Group*1 p.m. Walnut Room in IMU: Female Graduate Student Group*5 p.m. Walnut Room in IMU: Female Undergraduate Group5 p.m. Hoosier Room in IMU: Male Undergraduate GroupOCR Open Office Hours: 10 a.m. to noon (Charter Room IMU), and2:30 to 6 p.m. (Charter Room IMU)*The Graduate Student focus groups are open to all graduate students, including doctoral students and students enrolled in professional degree programs such as IU Law and Kelley School of Business.Tuesday2 p.m., Hoosier Room in IMU: International Student Group*2 p.m., Distinguished Alumni Room in IMU: LGBTQ Student & Allies Group**4 p.m., Hoosier Room in IMU: Female Undergraduate Group4 p.m., Distinguished Alumni Room in IMU: Male Undergraduate GroupOCR Open Office Hours: 10 a.m. to noon (Charter Room IMU), and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.OCR Open Office Hours: 10 a.m. to noon (Charter Room IMU), and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. (Charter Room IMU)*International Student focus group is open to both graduate and undergraduate international students.**LGBTQ Student & Allies focus group is open to both graduate and undergraduate LGBTQ students.Wednesday12:30 p.m., IU Health Center, first floor Administrative Room 100: Female Survivor & Advocacy Group4 p.m., McNutt Residence Hall 208B: HoosierLink Student Group6:30 p.m., Shuel Academic Center, Room E009: Male Athlete Student Group6:30 p.m., Shuel Academic Center, Room E013: Female Athlete Student GroupOCR Open Office Hours: 10 a.m. to noon (Distinguished Alumni Room IMU)2 p.m. to 5 p.m. (Distinguished Alumni Room IMU)Thursday12:30 p.m., IU Health Center, first floor Admin.

This committee addresses financial conflicts of interest in research.In its first meeting of the school year, the council also took on discussion regarding sexual assault policies.The BFC responded to a recent routine investigation spearheaded by the Department of Education, which was announced earlier this year, and recent changes to Title IX.“(Title IX) does currently require changes in some of the policies and procedures that we use to investigate, first of all, any claims of sexual assault or harassment,” said Jacqueline Simmons , vice president and general counsel for IU.According to changes to Title IX, students seeking anonymity must be referred to a “confidential employee,” said Emily Springston, associate general counsel for IU. Confidential employees include employees from Counseling and Psychological Services , the Student Advocates Office and the IU Employee Assistance Program .Only confidential ?employees can promise students anonymity. Responsible employees, however, are legally required to report sexual misconduct and cannot promise students anonymity, Springston said.Responsible employees must report sexual misconduct to an IU Bloomington Title IX Coordinator, according to a handout regarding faculty response to sexual misconduct. IU-Bloomington Title IX coordinators include IUB Deputy Title IX Coordinators Carol McCord and Jason Casares and University Title IX Coordinator Julie Knost.“It becomes the university’s legal obligation to investigate and respond according to the language found in Title IX,” Simmons said.Also at the meeting, the COI committee added two new members, the associate dean for research spot from the School of Public Health as well as a spot for the School of Public and Environmental Affairs associate dean for ?research.The committee also reduced the number of BFC members from four to three and granted the committee the ability to revise its own bylaws.

The increase this year is a result of the addition of new student groups on campus. IU is now home to approximately 800 student-run organizations, Rose said.“I’m hoping it’s because more students are learning about the opportunities available through student organization and the student leadership opportunities,” Rose said.New groups on campus include women empowerment club, Smart Girls Group and political activists ?Students for Hillary.In addition to student organizations, the fair will include 50 local volunteer agencies, such as Middle Way House and the Bloomington center for domestic violence and sexual assault victims.The Bloomington Community Orchard, which donates fruit to local organizations, and New Leaf New Life, a program for recently released paroled residents, will also be in attendance, Rose said.Thirty-two IU departments , such as the IU Cinema , the Asian Cultural Center and IU Outdoor Adventures will also be present at the fair.“Whenever I’ve worked with student leaders, I’ve heard them say that their journey with involvement really did start at the Student Involvement Fair,” Rose said. “A lot of students find their niche at IU at the Student ?Involvement Fair.”Not only will there be informational booths set up for the organizations present, but student performances will take place in addition to WIUX DJ-ing.Other student booths will be handing out more than just pamphlets, as adoptable pets will be present from the Humane Society.This diverse event is expected to draw in 6,000 to 8,000 students, Rose said.With such a large group comes a lot of trash. The Student Life and Learning center has joined with the Office of Sustainability and IU Grounds to start an outdoor recycling initiative.The Office of Sustainability ordered half recycling and half trash stations for Dunn Meadow, said Miriam Zakem, Office of Sustainability summer intern and No Waste Program coordinator.The Student Involvement Fair has always provided ?recycling bins, but this year SLL hopes to use the fair as a kickstart for having recycling at all outdoor events, Rose said.Before this pilot program for recycling, student organizations renting space at Dunn Meadow automatically received trash services but would have to plan for recycling separately, Rose said.This new program will provide trash and recycling together.',\n",

The hacker has made a spectacle of these women and their intimate photos.The hacker has made these photographs something to be sought out and discussed in Internet forums in the same fashion that one would view and discuss the latest and greatest memes and Internet trends.Internet forums invite discussion and criticism or even praise for these photographs, but they are not meant for discussion.They are the private property of famous women who have been wrongfully stolen from their personal digital storage, and sharing them exploits the subject of the ?photographs.There are countless men and women who send nude pictures of themselves to other people.It doesn’t matter for what reason these intimate photos exist. It doesn’t really even matter that they do, indeed, exist.What matters is that the subject of these photos has an intended audience when they take these photos.Anyone who chooses to disregard the subject’s personal privacy and shares these photos with other people is also exploiting that person’s body and sexuality because others are being invited into the personal and intimate sphere without the subject’s permission.The argument of “if you don’t want your nude photos leaked on the Internet, you shouldn’t take them,” is a victim-blaming argument, similar to the argument of “her skirt was too short.”Jennifer Lawrence has handled the situation with decorum and class.She has not moved to apologize or take responsibility for the situation, nor should she, for she is the ?victim.It was her privacy and her body that have been compromised. It does not matter in the slightest what she does with her personal space or her body and sexuality.That is no one’s business but her own, and an apology or taking responsibility would only encourage the victim-blaming mentality that circulates within society.johnstra@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Sexual assault remains a problem on college campuses all across the country. The issue has inspired some to come up with creative means of ?prevention.A group of students at North Carolina State University is developing a nail polish that can detect the presence of date rape drugs.While it is obvious the idea comes from an intention to help lower the risk of sexual assault, the message the product sends could be harmful instead.Any idea or product that stops rape should be explored and, if it works, ?utilized.It is naïve to live as though things such as date rape drugs don’t exist, and doing so could get someone seriously hurt.In an effort to combat the sexually predatory situation that many girls find themselves in, many products such as coasters, and now nail polish, are trying to perfect the science of prediction.It remains to be seen whether or not this can be done, but in the meantime there are a few problems with this particular theoretical product that should be addressed before it hits the shelves.First of all, the product is directed at women, which completely ignores other demographics at risk for sexual assault.Generally, nail polish is considered to be a feminine staple, and men unwilling to cross that line are left unprotected by this product.Targeting the female demographic this way reinforces the idea that rape is a women’s problem, which silences men who might be ashamed to be victims and puts the burden of prevention on women.Not only are women expected to check their drinks for date rape drugs, they are also required to do it stealthily, as though not to offend their potential rapist.It is true that not every guy who hands you a drink is suspicious, but considering most rapes are committed by someone the victim knows, a person can’t always know just by looking.Women should not have to hide the fact they are protecting themselves, because if they don’t, they are blamed for being reckless, stupid or slutty.Projecting that you are testing your drink makes it less likely that someone will try to slip something into it.The real problem with this product, and with those like it, is they have the potential to perpetuate victim-blaming in cases of sexual assault.Instead of addressing the problem — that of some men don’t understanding consent or that the media continuously projects women as sex objects instead of people or that sick sexual predators on the loose because their sexual crimes have not been taken seriously — it is just another Band-Aid.It is another piece of advice that, while meant to work as armor during the uphill battle of eradicating the real problems, will inevitably serve as just another way to blame the woman for not taking yet another inconvenient and ultimately ineffective precaution.Women can’t walk alone at night, they can’t wear short skirts, and now they can’t even paint their nails the color of their choice.Until we can teach our society to not rape instead of to not get raped, these bandages are what we have to protect ourselves from predators. They are the definition of the lesser of two evils.The ultimate goal would be that people don’t have to worry about things such as this.Until that utopia is realized, products that help protect everyone from the creeps of the world are necessary, ?encouraged and welcome.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A crowd of people stood in the afternoon heat Tuesday to witness the rededication of a commemorative plaque to Susan B. Anthony for the nationally celebrated Women’s Equality Day.The plaque was originally dedicated in 2012 but was taken down three weeks ago for building remodeling.The City of Bloomington Commission on the Status of Women and the Monroe County Women’s Commission planned the event in conjunction with Women’s Equality Day because of Susan B. Anthony’s historic visit in 1887.That visit started the women’s rights movement in Bloomington, MCWC Chair Efrat Feferman said.“We have a proud tradition of being leaders in social justice here in Monroe County,” Feferman said.“This is a commemoration to the roots of a particular movement, so I think it’s neat to celebrate, honor and highlight.”The rededication took place outside the new Seaview Outfitters store on the downtown Square . The site used to be Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, where Anthony spoke during one of her two visits.“It was really exciting for me to learn that Susan B. Anthony had been here,” BCSW Chair Cathi Crabtree said.“She campaigned on a national level for women’s suffrage but thought small Bloomington was important enough to come to.”Aside from celebrating Anthony’s visits to Bloomington, Crabtree said she hoped the event would raise awareness for women’s ?issues.“My main goal for today is to highlight the importance of women voting and women getting the right to vote in 1920,” Crabtree said.“Women are voting in greater numbers than men, so I’m glad we’re not squandering that right.”Not only did the event identify various advances in women’s equality, but it also shed light on the improvements the group believes still need to be made.“I hope the event will raise awareness about how far we have come, but also how far we have yet to go,” Crabtree said.“Disparities still exist between women and men, and I hope this is an invitation to people to stay engaged and continue to make changes for the betterment of women.”Bloomington policies on women align almost directly with those of the state and nation, Crabtree said.“On boards and commissions, women still represent about 33 percent of ?statutory commissions but around 50 percent of non-statutory commissions,” Crabtree said.“This is important because statutory commissions are the ones made by law and that can implement policy.”Feferman said poverty, access to healthcare, violence and sexual assault are also challenges women face disproportionately.Bloomington resident Sarah Ryterband attended the rededication as well as the original dedication. She said this time around, there were only about one-third of the amount people than there were at the original event.However, she said the event still reminded her that “the job’s not done” when it comes to fighting for women’s rights. She said she hopes women will register to vote and stay informed about the upcoming election.Registering to vote, staying educated about women’s rights issues and getting involved were all things Feferman said help ensure women’s equality.“I know women in places of power doesn’t equate with better opportunities for other women,” Ryterband said. “But without women in power, it’s much too easy for it to be a boy’s club.”',\n",

The Lifeline Law has got your back.The Lifeline Law provides immunity (meaning you won’t get in trouble) to minors against the crimes of minor possession, consumption and transportation of alcohol “while seeking medical assistance for a person suffering from an alcohol-related health emergency,” according to the law.Here are the stipulations, though: you have to give your full name and any other information law enforcement needs, you have to remain on the scene until help arrives and you have to fully cooperate with the authorities. The Lifeline Law also only works with alcohol-related incidents, not other drugs. Don’t be afraid to call for help. You’re covered.Source indianalifeline.orgGet consent. A real, verbal “Yes.”Sex without consent is rape. Nineteen percent of college women will be sexually assaulted or will be the victim of attempted sexual assault during their four years in college, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Make sure verbal, conscious consent is given freely from all participants before engaging in any sexual activities. If you are assaulted or someone attempts to assault you, call 911 immediately.Don’t drink on an empty stomach.Don’t go to that cool party until after you’ve had a nice, big dinner. The age-old wisdom is very much true: alcohol is absorbed into the bloodstream more quickly when you have an empty stomach. Don’t end the night early because you have to go puke for an hour.Source mayoclinic.orgBe in charge of your own drinks.We’re in college — we like to drink cheaply. A lot of times, that means Gatorade and crappy vodka. But no matter your cocktail of choice, don’t let someone else mix it. You never know what someone might have slipped into it or how much they have served you. In that same vein, don’t leave your drink unattended at a party. Hold onto it.There are a million ways to get home. ?Don’t let drunk driving be one.Plan in advance exactly how you’re going to get home after a night of drinking — whether it be the Night Owl bus, a taxi, a designated driver or just walking with a friend. Worst-case scenario: just ask to spend the night with someone. Drunk driving kills 28 people a day, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A human life is far too high a price to pay for laziness.?Pace yourself.Don’t feel pressured into taking 10 shots in 10 minutes. That’s asking to get your stomach pumped. Drink casually and socially. Hold on to the same cup for an hour and sip it occasionally.Know your limits.Don’t drink more than you’re comfortable with just because it seems like that’s what others are doing. Early in the night, set a number of drinks you’re planning on having, and stick to it. When you’re done drinking, fill a solo cup with something non-alcoholic and rock that drink for the rest of the night.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The campaign “hashtag” “Why I Don’t Need Feminism” became popular at the end of summer when the Tumblr blog “We Don’t Need Feminism!,” and others like it, went viral.Young and slightly middle-aged women held up signs outlining the reasons they didn’t believe in the cause.The campaign is meant to protest the sometimes abrasive and demanding nature of feminism, which, given that it’s a human rights campaign, it’s a little understandable how it might make a demand here or there.In short, the campaign is dangerously selfish.The women who participate fail to understand there are serious women’s rights issues that are pervasive and insidious, that harm and kill women and girls.According to them, women don’t need feminism because they want to “respect all humans, not just one gender,” or because they “do not need a leg-up to succeed.”Each sign demonstrated an enormously fundamental misunderstanding of what feminism is, especially given that the vast majority of their points are, in fact, feminist doctrine.They painted feminism as a series of extremist groups that make extremist demands, who believe that women must defy gender norms and forsake make-up and dresses.They tried to address the idea that feminism, when enacted by a group who does not understand its principles, can do to women what it seeks to avoid: pigeon-hole them into groups and stereotypes.They addressed an idea of feminism that does not exist, or at least, is not taken seriously even among feminist circles and in feminist debate.It’s hard to take a protest seriously when the participants do not understand what they’re protesting.But even more pressing is the fact that the campaign and the blogs that have sprung from it have fostered a dangerous environment that discounts the urgent needs of women internationally, not just in the United States.It is important to note that the majority of the women participating in the “Why I Don’t Need Feminism” campaign seem to be Western and white, women who by default have been given privileges allowing them to see the world through rose-colored glasses.Each of their objections discussed only the needs of the original poster, and they protested only the most basic stereotypes of feminism itself — the idea it hates men, that it wants women to be dominant and that it allows women to become victims of society.And as college students, with many fantastic campaigns raising awareness about sexual assault on campuses and the issues of rape and abuse finally coming under serious scrutiny, it felt like taking one massive step backward.It also dangerously discounts and belittles the lack of women’s rights. Not ludicrous demands for dominance over men, but serious issues that damage and profoundly affect the lives of millions. Not once was the plight of the single mother considered or the need to have easy access to childcare.Or the need to have fair and unbiased court trials, job opportunities, the need to end the wage gap or the need to reconsider erroneous double standards for gender.Nor did these women discuss the need for peaceful race relations between women and the need to prevent environments that foster unhealthy competition for recognition or rights. Or the fact that women barely have any representation either in Congress or the media, women of color even less so.And that’s just in America.On top of that, the women who participate in this campaign fail to understand they are refusing a cause whose very existence has allowed them to post their pictures online, to read and write the signs they made.If we are going to get anywhere, if we are going to address women’s issues, and by default address men’s issues as well via the idea that essential human rights must be given to all, regardless of gender, race or age.Feminism wants to foster the idea that women deserve the same easy acces to basic human rights that men do, not that men all die a fiery death so that women can become the sole gender. We’re going to need to recognize that there are serious problems that have nothing to do with gender battles.Once we do that, we can start coming up with serious solutions.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A man was cycling around 11 p.m. July 24 on the B-Line trail when he felt something hard push against his back.He assumed it was a weapon, Bloomington Police Department Captain Joe Qualters said.He was then robbed of his wallet and reported the robbery to the police.A similar incident happened days later with a female cyclist on the trail around the same time of night.In response to this criminal activity, the Bloomington Police Department has increased patrols of the downtown trail. In a press release, the department announced it will be expanding police patrols to have a “noticeable increase in law enforcement presence.”A Bloomington staple, the trail was completed in late 2011 and runs from Adams Street on the north side of town to Country Club Drive on the south side. The 3.1-mile course features both human- and pet-friendly drinking fountains as well as art installations by local and national artists.“We recognize that this trail is very popular,” Qualters said. “We want to encourage people to use it.”These are not the first instances of crime occurring on or around the trail. Last year, a woman was reportedly sexually assaulted on the trail in the middle of the day, according to WTIU, sparking conversation about the safety of the trail.“We’ve always had officers that are assigned to the trail,” Qualters said.The trail is already a part of three patrol districts. Officers assigned to those districts are responsible for patrolling it along with the downtown resource officers that typically patrol the trail’s intersection with Kirkwood Avenue and other downtown locations.“What we’re doing with the increase in patrols is we’re supplementing those officers,” Qualters said.Although recent incidents have occurred at night, patrols will increase police presence throughout the day and night to assure the trail remians safe for all users.The police plan to patrol the trail on foot, bicycle and with the department’s all-terrain vehicle.IU senior Rachel Johansen said her favorite part of the B-Line trail is the area over by the train tracks, near the location of the Bloomington farmer’s market. Johansen is a member of IU Run Club, which meets every evening in the fall and spring.Although Johansen runs at night in other areas, she said she stays away from the B-Line trail at night.“I generally try not to run too late over there just for safety reasons,” she said.Even when running in other locations, Johansen tries to stay in the well-lit places and always runs with a buddy.The BPD also issued several tips for staying safe while running or walking on the B-Line, including carrying a cell phone for emergency use, using the “buddy system” when possible or staying reasonably close to others using the trail, avoiding use of the trail late at night and not visiting more remote locations on the trail with lower populations.The department also reminded those who frequent the B-Line that the trail’s light poles are numbered to aid runners and walkers in identifying their location in the event of an emergency.Ultimately, individuals using the B-Line trail are encouraged to report any suspicious activity or people to police immediately, according to the ?release.',\n",

       "  'body': 'June marked the start of New Student Orientation, a program session required of all first-time freshmen students. But the projected 6,500 incoming IU students this year can expect to have a different New Student Orientation experience than in previous years.Melanie Payne, New Student Orientation director and Office of First Year Experience senior associate director, said the biggest adjustments logistically were location-based because of the ongoing construction in Wright Residence Hall, the traditional housing location for all incoming students at IU for summer orientation.“We’re housing students in Union Street, and we’re doing check in there,” Payne said. “We’re also moving our operation offices to Union Street. We’re doing this to accommodate for a certain number of people in a location.”Construction has also relocated fall class registration from Wells Library to the computer lab near Gresham Food Court at Foster Residence Hall.“We run a shuttle on the second day of the program to help students get around easier,” Payne said. “When you’re a new student, it’s not as obvious as telling a student to get to the library. Thanks to IU RPS and UITS, we’ve been able to adjust.”Despite location changes, IU Orientation has kept many of the orientation programs that are considered tradition, such as the Campus Legends Tour, while also adding a few additional programs to help new students.“We spent this past year doing focus groups, re-looking over messages,” Payne said. “We restructured our program on giving students practical tools. We really spelled out the business of becoming a student: What is the Hoosier experience? What is it like? What’s the community like?”Payne said the two sides of being a student at IU are the business and the experience. IU New Student Orientation has put more emphasis on connecting career and academic advising, how to use OnCourse, as well as implementing new safety sessions for both parents and students.Safety sessions were created to help students learn and think about bystander intervention, consensual sex, the Indiana Lifeline Law, as well as the concept of the Culture of Care initiative, a student-based organization aimed at promoting safety and well-being on campus.Leslie Fasone, assistant dean of Students for Women’s and Gender Affairs, presented and helped assist in shaping the safety sessions along with the director of OASIS, a center aimed toward drug and alcohol prevention among students, Jackie Daniels.“Throughout the presentation we urge parents to talk to their students about situations that they may encounter in college and how they can respond to them to help create a caring environment at IU,” Fasone said. “We also encourage them to talk about consensual sex and issues of sexual assault with their incoming student.”By creating potential scenarios the incoming students might encounter, the safety sessions ask accompanying parents to discuss the scenarios with their incoming student and encourage them to be a positive influence on campus.“The message that we work to convey during the safety session is that we are working to create an environment where IU students have the courage to care,” Fasone said. “We emphasize that parents will often be the ones who students will talk to about problems and ask for help. We hope that students will embrace this concept as they enter IU to create a culture of care on campus.”Garrett Humphrey, an incoming freshman majoring in biology, went to one of the first week orientation sessions and said he believed orientation this year was very helpful.“Before orientation, I was excited but a bit nervous,” Humphrey said. “Now, I’m even more excited and a little less nervous. These programs cleared some things up for me that I was kind of worried about.”Although they were optional, he also chose to attend the safety sessions.“I believe those sessions are very important,” Humphrey said. “I already had prior knowledge of these topics, but I feel I’m the minority. Safety is a big deal, and I don’t want any of my friends to get hurt because others don’t know these laws.”Whether the location changes of orientation this year are permanent or will continue next summer is unclear, but Payne said he is excited for the future of the programmatic changes.“I am thrilled with the opportunity to do these things for new students,” Payne said. “The responses have been really good so far, and I’d love to give credit to the Orientation Team. They’re doing their best to help students.”',\n",

Remembering the acronym AWARE can be helpful.Arrange for ridesAssign a designated driver before heading out. If a car is not an option, services such as IU Safety Escort and the Night Owl bus route are.Another option would be to take a taxi. Keep in mind most drivers do not use meters, so cab fare could be pricey.Weigh the risksWe won’t talk you out of drinking on a Friday night. No one else will either. College is about making decision for yourself. We just want you to be safe, so here are a few things you should know.You probably think it would never happen to you, but drinking can be dangerous. People who are new to drinking typically have low tolerances for alcohol, so do not exceed it.People who have drunk enough to pass out are at risk of choking to death on their own vomit or suffering from alcohol poisoning. The end result could be the emergency room or, sometimes, death.Another issue that can come with college parties is sexual assaults. As many as one in four college women experience unwanted sexual intercourse in the United States, and many of these incidents happen at or after parties. The majority of sexual assaults involve alcohol.Assistance on CampusThroughout campus are emergency stations to assist students in need. Hit the red button on any of these stations, which will contact the IU Police Department, and a blue light will flash on the surrounding area.The button pad above it can also call IUPD, Safety Escort Services and the Motor Assistance program.ReactIt is important to know that if you see a friend who is showing signs of alcohol poisoning, do not hesitate to call 911. You will not get in trouble for saving someone’s life.Be careful of mixed punches, as their alcohol and/or drug content is often a mystery. Do not leave your drink unattended. Never leave a friend alone when he or she has had too much to drink.Know where you are and how to get home. Carry cash in case a cab is needed, and do not rely on someone you do not know to give you a ride home.If ever attacked by an aggressor, IUPD’s Leslie Slone, suggests staying mobile. It is more difficult to catch a moving target.Educate yourselfThe Indiana Lifeline Law provides immunity for the crimes of public intoxication, minor possession, minor consumption and minor transport for persons who reveal themselves to law enforcement while seeking medical assistance for a person suffering from an alcohol-related health emergency.Immunity will be received if the individual gives authorities all necessary information, if the individual stays on the scene and if the individual cooperates with authorities.The IU Health Center has a Sexual Assault Crisis Service that offers crisis intervention, individual and group counseling and educational programming.It is available for any member of the IU community free of charge. This service has a 24-hour telephone line, 812-855-8900, which will put you in touch with a specially trained counselor who can answer questions and further assist you.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Attorney General Eric Holder met with officials from eight universities in the Washington D.C. area to discuss how to address sexual assault on university campuses across the nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gathering was organized to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act and concluded an eight-day tour organized by the Office of Violence Against Women.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meeting, which took place May 14, came in the wake of the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights releasing a list of 55 colleges under investigation for possible sexual violence violations that includes Ivy League universities, public universities and local colleges. \\r\\n\\r\\nIU and Vincennes University are the only two Indiana institutions on the federal list.\\r\\nOfficials at the meeting exchanged ideas on the successes and shortcomings of their respective plans in confronting sexual assault on their campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nCatholic University of America was among the universities represented at the meeting that is also under investigation by the DOE.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some colleges’ placement on the list was a result of students filing a Title IX complaint, Mark Land, associate vice president of public affairs and government relations, said IU’s placement on the list was not a consequence of such a complaint.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The DOE is in the process of conducting what it calls a compliance review to take a look at how Bloomington campus handles sexual assault cases and to examine the programs and staffing we have in place to help educate students on the issue and create a safe environment,” Land said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in 2012, the University had the highest number of sexual assaults reported among universities in the state of Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the 2013 IU Annual Security report, 27 sexual assaults were reported on campus in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nVincennes University had three sexual assaults reported. Purdue University and Ball State University, Indiana’s other two major public universities, reported two and eight, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January, President Barack Obama signed a Presidential Memorandum establishing the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White House task force aims to accentuate and remedy the prevalence of sexual assault crimes at higher education institutions nationwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast month, the White House task force released its first report titled “Not Alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As the name of our new website NotAlone.gov indicates, we are here to tell sexual assault survivors that they are not alone,” the White House task force said in the report. “We’re also here to help schools live up to their obligation to protect students from sexual violence.” \\r\\n\\r\\nThe task force recommended four initial steps for schools to undertake: identify the scope of the problem on college campuses, help prevent campus sexual assault, help schools respond effectively when a student is assaulted, increase transparency and improve enforcement. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1999, the Office of Violence Against Women has spent more than $139 million in projects addressing violence and sexual assault on campuses across the nation.\\r\\nDebbie Melloan, a counselor at the University’s Sexual Assault Crisis Services, said she believes schools must also play a role in preventing sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have a responsibility under Title IX to respond to and prevent sexual violence,” Melloan said. “I think we have a good network of services and resources to respond to sexual assault on campus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sexual Assault Crisis Services administers several programs throughout the year directed at raising awareness and providing information about sexual assault, Melloan said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, it offers individual, couples and group counseling for sexual assault victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual Assault Services also provides a free 24/7 service line for assault victims or anyone who knows assault victims.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re here to address sexual assault on campus and advocate for not only women, but also men who have also been affected by this,” Melloan said. “I think we do a good job. The information and resources are available.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter becoming aware of the Department of Education’s compliance review in mid-March, the University provided the initial pieces of information requested, Land said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The campus has not yet received any feedback from the DOE and probably won’t for a few months,” he said\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, IU administration will continue to address sexual assault on campus.\\r\\n“This is a vitally important area, and campus takes nothing more seriously than the safety of its students,” Land said. “Campus leaders are continually looking at ways to strengthen its processes and practices regarding sexual assault to create the safest possible environment for our students and to nourish a culture of respect toward women on our campus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe administration also works closely with IUPD on sexual assault prevention strategies, Land said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLt. Craig Munroe, the IU Police Department public information officer, said IUPD has a meeting every quarter with all the agencies that might have a sexual assault reported to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a collaborative effort, and we try to get a reflection on what’s happening at IU,” Munroe said. “The IU Health Center, Student Advocates Office and IU administration get together, sit down and make sure everyone knows what’s going on.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIUPD participates in any committees or programs associated with sexual assault, Munroe said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is a cultural problem,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand said law enforcement offices outside of campus are a big help to IUPD in fixing that problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n“IUPD has a very close relationship with the Bloomington Police Department as well as the Monroe County prosecutor’s office to ensure that sexual assault complaints in and around campus are investigated promptly and thoroughly and, when appropriate, prosecuted vigorously,” Land said.\\r\\n\\r\\nIU appreciates the focus being placed on this issue by President Obama’s administration, Land said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are hopeful that this increased emphasis on sexual assault on college campus will help all universities address this issue more effectively,” he said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The state recently allocated $65,000 to fund a study this summer that will investigate why Indiana has such a high rate of teen sexual assault, but the study may also shed light on sexual assault crimes happening in Bloomington.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighty-five percent of rape victims are under the age of 30, and 44 percent of those are under the age of 18, said Cierra Olivia Thomas-Williams, prevention programs coordinator at the Bloomington Middle Way House.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indiana is second highest in the nation for rape among teenage girls, so we’re really suffering here,” Thomas-Williams said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe researchers at IUPUI’s Global Health Communication Center will focus on teenagers younger than 18 in the study. Thomas-Williams said preventing early sexual abuse might reduce the rate of future abuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A large percentage of the people who do come through our shelter have experienced child sexual abuse,” Thomas-Williams said. “Many of the crimes that happen get connected to other terrible outcomes later.” \\r\\n\\r\\nFor every rape, the percentage of revictimization goes up close to 9 percent and close to 50 percent after that because rapists target vulnerability, Thomas-Willams said. These numbers also have effects at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We see a lot more assaults here, both domestic and sexual violence, in the week prior to the semester starting,” Thomas-Williams said. “What we think is there’s a lot of partying, maybe for the first time, but also, a lot of people are away from their parents for the first time ever.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest-risk time for college students is their freshman year, especially for students 18 and younger, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepresentative Christina Hale, D-Indianapolis, said she will not stand for shocking numbers like these anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The national average is 10.5 percent,” Hale said. “In Indiana, it’s 17.2 percent, or one in six girls, and I find that to be outrageous and unacceptable. And nobody had done anything about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Hale, who proposed the study that IUPUI researchers will conduct, the biggest challenge is that these numbers are aggregate, meaning there isn’t just one type of rape happening in Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Those crimes are everything from date rape to incest to random acts of violence to child seduction,” Hale said. “Many young women and girls don’t even realize that they’re a victim of a crime because in their family incest is normal.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to be efficient and effective with tax dollars, Hale said Indiana needs more information about the nature of these crimes before the state can start to combat them with legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers will conduct two surveys. One will look at people who interact with teenagers, such as teachers, and the other will try to understand why victims don’t always report their child sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People in general don’t want to report because it doesn’t feel good,” Thomas-Williams said. “The questions that a law enforcement officer asks a victim of a crime are based on trying to find facts and that’s why it can feel very impersonal for survivors.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHale said her ultimate goal is twofold. She wants to aid victims in attaining the services they need so that they feel more comfortable reporting a sexual assault, and she wants to use the research to prevent sexual assaults in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother component of the study will focus on social media’s influence on sexual assault, trafficking and blackmail. One in five girls will be raped on a college campus, Hale said, and social media is becoming a part of the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These crimes are being iterated in ways that are unprecedented even five or 10 years ago,” Hale said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Thomas-Williams and Hale said they are hopeful the study will give the state some important insight into teen sexual assault and put Indiana on the right track toward recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that this is indicative that change is happening, that people are involved and that people want to work on it,” Thomas-Williams said. “To have federal support for that means something. It means something good.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'IU-Bloomington is undergoing a federal investigation for its handling of sexual harassment cases as part of a nationwide effort to improve how college campuses respond to sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to initial reports, this investigation is not random. Education department spokeswoman Dorie Nolt said information from parents and advocacy groups, statistical data and other forms of information sparked an investigation at IU “to remedy possible violations of students’ rights.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis type of investigation is exactly what IU and colleges around the country need.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am proud to go to a school that usually treats sexual assault seriously and a school that had Slutwalk and a surge of anti-sexual assault programs in anticipation of Little 500. Our freshman orientation features an anti-sexual assault segment, and we have a 24-hour Sexual Assault Crisis Service at the IU Health Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indiana Daily Student has made reporting instances of sexual assault and rape a priority. But despite the number of resources IU already has available, we have to keep talking about it. We have to keep working towards a solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe national statistics are pretty bad. For women, they’re worse, but college men are also victims of sexual violence. Ultimately, though, the exact statistics don’t even matter. For example, IU is only obligated to report rapes on IU-owned property and many go unreported. One sexual assault of an IU student is already too many.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good news is not only are college campuses becoming more accountable, the White House is also getting involved. Last week, it released a video featuring the president and a string of male celebrities speaking about preventing sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe way to prevent sexual assault is to stop it at the source, and the majority of sources are men. But this is not a men vs. women issue, a stance that simultaneously insults both sexes. It’s an issue of rape vs. not rape. We need to work through the stereotypes “boys will be boys” who can’t help themselves, women are either helpless victims or at fault for the way they dress and the idea it is always women who are raped. None of these are true.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White House video was an amazing step to defeat these stereotypes. Even James Bond himself, Daniel Craig, took part in the video, proving you can still be the height of masculinity and care about sexual assault. \\r\\n\\r\\nIU’s pre-Little 500 “Don’t Rape” program for men was another step in the right direction. It was a much more effective method than just telling girls to watch their backs and carry pepper spray. \\r\\n\\r\\nI hope the current investigation does not reveal IU mishandled any sexual assault cases, but I recognize the importance of such an investigation. As long as sexual assaults are still happening, there is a need for preventative programs, treatment for victims and overall awareness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s about time schools are accountable for incidents of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xadcjellert@indiana.edu\\r\\n@cjellert',\n",

       "  'body': 'Every semester, Opinion has plenty to talk about. The spring semester of the 2013-2014 academic school year saw the continuation of changes that have been in motion not only since the fall, but since the beginning of a decade that has continued to bring about changes both on campus and across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere at IU, we saw the continued inaction of a student government so out of touch and so oblivious to what actually matters to the average undergraduate that taking the IU Student Association to task has essentially amounted to one of the outstanding responsibilities of the Indiana Daily Student Editorial Board.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of substantive student input and student voice in the University took center stage this semester, including in what eventually amounted to another non-competitive IUSA election. Despite this, the incoming administration is positioned to push for IUSA to actually do what it’s supposed to be doing — represent students.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe push will be needed in the face of significant changes being pushed on the campus by the administration, as outlined by another highlight of this semester, the Campus Strategic Plan. The majority of it is little more than feel-good rhetoric and opaque wording.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the reason why it has come to matter and it will continue to do so is because, for better or worse, it presents the direction our University is heading.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome other primary semester highlights for the Editorial Board include the significant donation to Assembly Hall and the necessary revitalization of other more important parts of our campus, IU’s timely and necessary push for gender-blind housing in our dormitories, campus safety after the Purdue shooting, President Michael McRobbie’s unnecessary withdrawal of the University from the American Studies Association, IU’s misguided expansion of its smoking ban, the raising of the University’s minimum wage and the possible deportation of IU junior Qun Sunn for owning a business.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn keeping with national trends, this semester we tackled some of the more troubling parts of greek life both on and off IU’s campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dangerous cultures that exist in some chapters are issues that are increasingly receiving national attention. But likewise, greek chapters are also addressing these issues and leading the charge in how we talk about fraternities and sororities, which we hope will lead to more progressive greek systems that college students deserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault also finally became a national conversation during the course of this semester.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the White House to our campus, we’ve witnessed the transformation of rape from a hushed conversation in public discourse to a roaring national campaign demanding action. IU currently a faces a probe from the Department of Education in how it handles sexual assaults. Unwittingly or not, we’ve become part of that conversation, which we hope can lead our University to even better ways to address one of the most perverse issues on college campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nNationally, we continued to see and be part of the ongoing social change the country is undergoing. From the inevitability of marriage equality to the beginning of the end of marijuana prohibition to setbacks for affirmative action, 2014 is turning out to be quite the year for some of the biggest issues we care about.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis semester might be ending, but we’re bound to continue to see and feel the aftermath of what’s happened during its course.\\r\\n\\r\\nopinion@idsnews.com\\r\\n@ids_opinion',\n",

       "  'body': 'Last week, the men of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at Gettysburg College each donned a pair of tall high heels before going out. No, it wasn’t for a dare or a tasteless party — instead, it was part of an effort to raise awareness about sexual assault on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nClad in red and orange pumps and stilettos, the group of more than 100 men embarked on Walk a Mile, an event to spread vital information about the statistics concerning rape and harassment women face in college.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the student-led Walk a Mile reminds us, an average of one in five women across America will experience the terror and trauma of sexual assault by the time they have graduated. Even IU is not immune to this threat, as demonstrated by the frequent reports of rape printed by the Indiana Daily Student and the knowledge that many rapes go unreported.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the fact that a fraternity has taken an active stand against sexual assault in such a bold manner is fantastic news. Though it surely raised some eyebrows, we say, “Keep it up, boys.” The Editorial Board believes it is incredibly refreshing to see such a proactive, supportive stance taken by a fraternity. Our campus could definitely benefit from something similar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough many schools, including IU, support similar assault awareness events such as SlutWalk, their inclusion of more male-focused events like Walk a Mile would be especially important as they have the possibility to reach an even broader audience. By encouraging IU’s fraternities to participate in a hands-on learning experience rather than a “don’t rape” lecture, the message behind sexual\\r\\nassault awareness might garner less eyerolls and actually stick.\\r\\n\\r\\nMales encouraging sexual assault awareness in such a way is also beneficial because it highlights the dichotomous way in which we view it. In American culture, heterosexual rape is sometimes regarded merely as a “feminist” or a “woman’s” issue, while male-male rape is scoffed at or ridiculed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these issues are entirely problematic, as sexual assault is everyone’s problem, and it is never something to be taken lightly. The Editorial Board believes encouragement of male organization and participation in events such as Walk a Mile will dispel the harmful idea that rape is a predominantly female concern and that we must work together in order to make our communities aware and safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough watching grown men try to hold their composure while traveling in heels for the first time is admittedly hilarious, it serves as a sobering reminder of the realities many women face right here on our campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter SAE’s roaring success with the Walk a Mile march, maybe we’ll see some of our own fraternity brothers careening down the sidewalks of Third Street in a pair of strappy slingbacks next spring.\\r\\n\\r\\nopinion@idsnews.com\\r\\n@ids_opinion',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights took a bold step Wednesday — in keeping with the White House’s push for more transparency when it comes to sexual assaults on campus — by releasing a list of universities under investigation for possible Title IX violations because of the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints.\\r\\n\\r\\nIU currently finds itself on that list.\\r\\n\\r\\nVice President Joe Biden told men everywhere to step up Tuesday at the official unveiling of the report and recommendations by the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve got to change this vast middle of the male population to say, ‘You have an affirmative obligation to intervene,’” Biden said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we should continue to target men and emphasize the importance of bystander intervention, there’s another actor on campus whom the task force believes must make changes if we are to seriously tackle the issue of sexual assault — the universities.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long list of colleges have found themselves in the news for the mishandling of sexual assault cases or completely covering them up.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic colleges and universities are institutions we trust with our well-being, our futures and who we’ve come — or at least want — to believe are looking out for our best interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the fact that colleges are actively being investigated for breaching that trust is frightening.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat’s even more horrifying is the possibility that universities continue to fail survivors of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis semester, two courageous women shared their powerful stories on the pages of this section regarding their sexual assaults.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth were sobering reminders of the human toll of failing to prevent rape and the fact that sexual assault does, in fact, happen on our campus much more often than we would like to believe.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if IU’s place among the list of colleges being investigated is purely procedural, it doesn’t mean IU should be complacent in taking extra steps to address an issue that clearly exists on our campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat matters is whether the University chooses to move forward now that the White House task force has released its findings and its recommendations — many of which fall on the laps of administrators to put into place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most tangible of these recommendations, which IU could easily institute, are campus-wide anonymous surveys designed to give colleges a better picture of the number of sexual assaults that occur versus the few that are actually reported.\\r\\nThe other primary recommendation from the task force IU could implement is increasing transparency.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the ways for IU to do exactly that would be by moving forward with the Indiana Daily Student Editorial Board’s call for the Office of Student Ethics to disclose whether sexual assaults have occurred in greek houses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an online poll on the IDS website, 87 percent of respondents said they believe the student ethics office should do so, in comparison to 7 percent who would oppose the change.\\r\\n\\r\\nIU has the tools to make a change and join this renewed push against sexual assault. It’s only a matter of whether the administration is willing to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nedsalas@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'New wings. That’s the message inscribed on the gates of Middle Way House. That’s what the clients of the shelter for domestic and sexual violence victims strive for.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle Way House offers 24-hour crisis intervention, emergency shelter, personal advocacy, legal advocacy, support groups, preventive programs and affordable housing — all free to clients.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is this accessibility and prolonged care that make Middle Way House one of six nationally recognized programs for domestic violence. But its service comes at a price.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe recession hit nonprofit organizations hard financially. Nationally, 41 percent of nonprofits said their number-one issue was achieving long-term financial sustainability, according to the 2013 Nonprofit Finance Fund survey.\\r\\n\\r\\nStatewide, 34 percent of Indiana’s domestic violence programs experienced a decrease in government funding, according to the National Network to End Domestic Violence’s 2013 report.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle Way is no exception.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are experiencing decreases pretty much across the board,” said Toby Strout, executive director of Middle Way House.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese financial cut backs have resulted in a reduction of staff for Middle Way, Strout said. Due to unfunded mandates instated by state government, Middle Way had to remove its overnight volunteer staff despite having paid staff back up and approval from their insurance company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese state unfunded mandates regulate this, as well as personnel policies, insurance levels, what programs Middle Way offers and how they are run. However, they do not provide funds to pay full-time employees to fulfill these requirements. As a result, Middle Way relies heavily on their volunteers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Funds are short everywhere when you’re looking at nonprofits,” said Debra Morrow, Middle Way House community service coordinator. “There is no way that Middle Way House could do the work without the volunteers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Middle Way 2012 annual report, the organization trained 370 volunteers who donated 27,676 hours of their time to make the shelter’s programs successful. These volunteers produce not only notable results but also a large financial break for Middle Way. In 2012, $277,000 was saved in salaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoughly 60 to 70 percent of Middle Way volunteers are IU students through the University’s Service-Learning Program.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that as young leaders, we can go in with an optimistic attitude and change the perception of domestic violence and make a difference,” said Blair Heidenreich, a Middle Way volunteer and junior social services student.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the volunteer and community support, it’s difficult for domestic violence programs to balance the increasing demand for services and decreasing government funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, the National Network to End Domestic Violence reported that, nationally, 61 percent of nonprofits’ income came from government grants.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2011-12 annual report, government grants only covered 34 percent of nonprofits’ income.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Middle Way 2012 financial report shows that 33 percent of its income is supported by grants from the federal, state and local government. This leaves a difference of more than $1 million dollars for Middle Way to make up through private foundations, fundraising events and donor solicitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis decline in funding coincides with a rise in need.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoast-to-coast, the Nonprofit Finance Fund found that 80 percent of nonprofits noticed an increase in demand for services in 2013. Fifty six percent of these nonprofits also reported that they were unable to meet this increased demand.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle Way is no different. Its 2012 annual report shows that of the 55 women who requested emergency shelter, 24 were denied because of lack of availability.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re still at capacity in the majority of our programs statewide,” said Laura Berry, executive director of Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence. “We’re still struggling to meet the needs of the requests of our population.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence found that 601 requests for shelter statewide were not met because of capacity limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn just one day, 298 requests for services could not be met in Indiana because of a lack of resources.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe economic recession plays a role in both of these issues. Fiscal cutbacks resulted in less money coming into nonprofits from both the government and the\\r\\ncommunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis financial strain created extra stress at home, which caused increased assault rates, Berry said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“During those economic downturns a couple years ago we were seeing some of our highest numbers,” Berry said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe threat of unemployment or homelessness also resulted in victims staying longer in shelters. From 2009 to 2011, the length of shelter stays increased by 18,419 days statewide, according to the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal government only funds the first 30 days for victims in emergency shelters, according to the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longest stay in the Middle Way emergency shelter has been eight months.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike most programs, Middle Way doesn’t have a time limit on how long clients can stay, they said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle Way doesn’t believe in limiting its clients, it believes in empowering them, according to its mission statement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the woman who needs to understand what she needs,” said Dorothy Granger, head of Middle Way marketing and communications. “We don’t tell the women what to do. We will help them do what they know they need to do.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Middle Way’s rate of domestic violence victims returning to their violent relationships was 13 percent. This is compared to the national return rate of 55 to 70 percent, Granger said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the perfect world we would work ourselves out of jobs,” Morrow said. “We wouldn’t be needed anymore and that would be wonderful, but that’s a bigger societal issue.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault issued Monday its first report outlining a comprehensive plan to address sexual assault on college campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Barack Obama created the task force in January to “strengthen\\r\\nfederal enforcement efforts and provide schools with additional tools to help combat sexual assault,” according to the report.\\r\\n \\r\\nNationally, one in five college women have been sexually assaulted, with 75 to 80 percent of reported cases citing the perpetrator as someone they knew prior to the attack, according to the report.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 2010 and 2012, the IU Office of the Executive Vice President for\\r\\nUniversity Academic Affairs documented 54 cases of forcible sexual offenses on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan outlines a four-pronged approach that begins with identifying the extent of sexual assault across universities using campus climate surveys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal government has agreed to provide schools with toolkits to\\r\\nconduct the survey next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeslie Fasone, assistant dean for women’s and gender affairs, said the University is already working to create a survey that assesses sexual behavior among students.\\r\\n\\r\\nFasone has been collaborating with other faculty, including Justin Garcia, assistant research scientist at the Kinsey Institute.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve been, over the past year, doing our own research to find out what kinds of sexual misconduct surveys have other schools done, what resources out there exist,” Fasone said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal report also cites prevention and engaging men as part of the strategy to combat the issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublic service announcements and bystander intervention programs are recommended to empower men to prevent these incidents from occurring.\\r\\n\\r\\nFaculty members and student organizations at IU have already adopted these measures to educate students in what they can do to stop dangerous situations.\\r\\n\\r\\nGarcia’s expertise in the college “hook-up” culture has provided a key link to communicating with men in bystander prevention presentations.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The idea is talking about hooking up is more engaging and less threatening for men than the simple message of sexual assault,” Fasone said. “Something else that we’re working on is that we really need to figure out how we engage them to empower them to step in and prevent incidents from occurring.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFederal officials have also created a new website, notalone.gov, as a tool to support the report’s initiatives. Students are able to file a complaint online if their university is failing to adequately address sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nSurvivors of sexual assault can locate support services in their area using their zip code. The IU Board of Trustees has also created a Student Welfare webpage with\\r\\ncampus resources that can address sexual assault, Fasone  said. She said the webpage was created this semester.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their mission statement, the IU Board of Trustees said they wish to build a community that rejects sexual assault completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy improving access to resources and continuing collaboration among different organizations, Fasone believes the trend of sexual assault can be reversed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have all these pockets of resources and people who are doing great work on this campus,” Fasone said. “It’s a matter of helping students navigate those resources and collectively working together to create a campus culture that creates change.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCarmen Heredia Rodriguez',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Obama administration issued aggressive guidelines to combat sexual assault on college campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, reform of the way the military handles sexual assault among its own ranks continues to languish in Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measures include confidentiality for reporters of sexual assault, anonymous student surveys on sexual assault and other anti-assault measures universities have found successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey come mostly from a report on sexual assault issued by a task force formed by the administration earlier this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe administration also established Notalone.gov, a new government website tracking enforcement and offering information to victims of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are important actions for the safety of college campuses nationwide. To many, they seem like common sense ideas, but sometimes common sense ideas are the easiest to overlook.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assaults in the military, however, remain unaddressed by this administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nA bill seeking to expand options for individuals who are sexually assaulted in the military passed the Senate unanimously in March.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat bill has failed to move in the House of Representatives. The bill’s ability to unite the entire Senate is an indicator of its minor scope.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough it offers victims new options and strengthens the rules of evidence in sexual assault proceedings, it leaves the military justice system intact.\\r\\n\\r\\nCases of military sexual assault will still be tried in military tribunals, not civilian courts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the commander-in-chief can unilaterally issue new, more effective guidelines for U.S. universities, surely he can do so for the U.S. military.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault on a campus is no more or less heinous than sexual assault on a military base.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault on university campuses is endemic in this country. According to the White House task force, one in five women in college will be a victim of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistics on sexual assault in the military are unreliable in that they represent a culture unfriendly to reporting.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 12-month period beginning in June 2012, members of the U.S. Armed Forces were 15 times more likely to be sexually assaulted — and report it — than to be killed by an enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expansion of the options to victims is a start, but these cases need to be taken out of the military justice system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. military needs to be reminded that it serves at the will of the people and within the scope of their discipline, not beyond it.\\r\\n\\r\\nClearly, the U.S. military needs reform just as desperately as U.S. colleges.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we applaud the members of our armed forces for their sacrifices on our behalf, it should be for their willingness to fight for our country, not their assumption of the risk of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ndrlreed@indiana.edu\\r\\n@D_L_Reed',\n",

       "  'body': 'Lynette Anigbo showed up for her first class of junior year with a backpack, a diaper bag, a breast pump and her baby boy strapped to her chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnigbo got pregnant at the beginning of her sophomore year when she was 20 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I really didn’t like kids, and I didn’t want to get married,” Anigbo said. “I was just going to jet set and see the world. That was my plan.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer boyfriend at the time was two years older, and Anigbo said he took off for California shortly after finding out she was pregnant.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer parents live in Nigeria, and she had to call them from across the world with the news.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My mom said, ‘Call your dad,’” Anigbo said. “My dad was like, ‘Well, you’re not the first girl, and you won’t be the last girl. Make sure you finish school.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Anigbo is 26 and in her final year as a master’s student at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. She has her own apartment, a job and a 5-year-old son, Charles, an outgoing kindergartner who likes to play soccer and guitar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the past six years at IU, Anigbo had to learn how to raise a child in an environment better suited for the single and carefree.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents with children on campus, like Anigbo, can spend years on the waiting lists at the IU childcare centers. The lactation rooms are limited and difficult to find.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis past year’s closing of the Office of Women’s Affairs eliminated a safe and obvious place for pregnant students to go for help.\\r\\n\\r\\nIU houses five child care centers, which are reserved for the children of IU students and faculty. A third of the parents who use these facilities are students, according to Coordinator of Child Care Services Tim Dunnuck.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo hundred children are enrolled in the program, and 500 are on the waitlist.\\r\\nBecause only eight infants are allowed in a classroom at a time, many younger children put on the waitlist do not get a spot, Dunnuck said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe infants who do get into the program end up filling up the toddler classes as well, gridlocking the waitlist until the child is of preschool age or older.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Right now, if you don’t get your child in as an infant, your next opportunity might not be until it is three years old,” Dunnuck said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor parents who do not gain a spot in a day care, Dunnuck said, he recommends a list of alternate options in the community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Bloomington has childcare available, Dunnuck said the quality of care in the community varies significantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The IU centers have traditionally been the best centers in the community,” Dunnuck said.\\r\\nDunnuck said he recommends prospective parents start looking for child care when the mother is pregnant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnigbo said she put her son on the waitlist a week after she found out she was pregnant, gaining a spot for him. But children can’t enroll in the IU day care until they are 7 weeks old, so she brought her son to class with her until he was old enough to enroll.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe received support from her peers and professors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnigbo said all but one of her professors in undergraduate and graduate school said she could bring her son to class with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she went into the hallway to feed her son during one class, Anigbo said, her professor lectured from the open door so she could continue listening.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing a full-time student and a full-time mom is challenging, and without the help of her parents or a partner, Anigbo said she had to learn a lot about raising a child on her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter making it through her son’s first five months, she approached the women at the former Office of Women’s Affairs and offered to write a Parents’ Packet that would help guide young mothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the packet, she highlights some of the resources available in the community, including information on breast-feeding on campus, day cares to try and the best way to schedule classes with a child.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnigbo described the Office of Women’s Affairs as a safe place for women to talk about pregnancy, as well as self-esteem problems, rape, sexual assault and sexism on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dissolved last year, and its responsibilities were divided between Human Resources and the Office of Student Affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnigbo cited Associate Dean of Students Carol McCord, former assistant dean of the Office of Women’s Affairs, as one of the most helpful resources for pregnant women on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCord has assisted Anigbo throughout her son’s life, helping her organize her classes so she could remain in school and telling her what rights professors and students have in terms of bringing their children to the classroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnigbo said it was such a helpful office because women knew exactly where to go with these uncomfortable or taboo issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It gets lost,” Angibo said. “It’s not easy to be like, ‘Hey, I think this is a specifically a girl issue’ because most of the time you’re trying to blend in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty-year-old Darian Foster is a friend of Anigbo’s and another student mom on campus. She is a junior youth development student at the School of Public Health.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband is also a student at IU, and they have been married for two years. Their son is 11 months old.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoster said she surprised herself with her resilience and ability to get things done. She no longer has the luxury of wasting time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Many students complain about not having enough time to do homework or study, but you haven’t studied your hardest until you’ve had to study on a time crunch because your child may wake up at any moment,” Foster said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFoster said she has not turned to the University for many resources, using government aid and Bloomington resources such as the Crisis Pregnancy Center, which offers discounted products and support for mothers in need. She is only aware of one lactation room on campus, Foster said, which is located in the Indiana Memorial Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are seven lactation rooms on campus, Anigbo said, but they are hard to find without asking.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome require codes to get in. Others are merely bathrooms with a chair next to it, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s disgusting,” Anigbo said. “You’re pumping next to a toilet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IU Health Center does not offer pregnant students prenatal care IU health and sexuality educator Kathryn Brown said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Brown said pregnant college women can meet with IU reproductive providers to discuss their options and be referred to resource centers in the community.  \\r\\nAnigbo said she tells her son that when he gets older, he is going to go to college and graduate school.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen her son’s father is watching Charles, Anigbo said she walks around campus and watches the students laughing, playing music in the grass and sitting on the rooftops.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wonders what it would be like to feel carefree again, to not have anyone depending on her.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Anigbo said she does not regret her choice, even if it meant growing up a little earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I realized that no one is really doing anything more meaningful than what I’m doing when I’m taking care of my son,” Anigbo said. “I’m not really missing anything. When I’m out, I want to go back home and lay down with my child.”',\n",

IUSA should be a living, breathing organization that’s always adapting and requires always going to students.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBraden is majoring in policy analysis in SPEA and is involved in the five-year accelerated master’s program in public affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he is not working with IUSA, Braden said he is performing in the improv group Awkward Silence or hanging out with his brothers in his fraternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nSophomore Leah Steele said she has been best friends with Braden for more than 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteele said the two have gone through precalc in school, long bus rides, spring break and great times together in college. She said Braden is the best person she knows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He genuinely cares about everyone around him and is the most compassionate person I know,” Steele said. “He is always busy changing the world in one way or another, but will drop everything to be there for those closest to him. I can always count on him having my back. Friends like that don’t come around very often.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBraden first got involved with IUSA in the internship program.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he took on many leadership roles in high school, he said he was drawn to IUSA because he wanted to join an organization that had the potential to make positive changes on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, Braden served as one of the co-presidents of Culture of Care, a group within IUSA dedicated to raising awareness about sexual assault, mental health and drug and alcohol abuse on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I didn’t have a lot of student government experience, it would definitely be a lot more intimidating,” Braden said. “I definitely feel ready.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent Chief of Staff and junior Dia Sharma will be serving in the same position in next year’s administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nSharma said she is excited to see the new dynamic that comes with any turnover of administration, as a result of different members and leadership styles within the team.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s a great leader. He commands respect when he walks into the room,” Sharma said. “He focuses a lot on the team, which is really important. He’s really insistent that we make sure we get the best people for the job.”  \\r\\n\\r\\nSharma said IUSA will organize interviews this week for next year’s executive branch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have a lot of new people that want to get involved, and a lot of great people returning,” Sharma said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBraden said he encourages any student who is not satisfied with their college experience to approach IUSA.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m looking forward to being able to fight for a cause on behalf of students,” Braden said. “A lot of student organizations do wonderful things, but IUSA is one of the few where you can really fight for something you’re passionate about. I’m excited just to look at the experience IU is offering students and see how we can improve that.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The month of April has been designated Sexual Assault Awareness Month in the United States since it was proclaimed by President Obama in 2009.  The National Sexual Violence Resource Center’s website describes the goal of SAAM as “to raise public awareness about sexual violence and to educate communities and individuals on how to prevent sexual violence.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRAINN, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network and America’s largest anti-sexual violence organization, reports that 237,868 sexual assaults occur annually in the U.S., which translates to a rape about every two\\r\\nminutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly 40 percent of sexual assaults are reported to police, and a whopping 97 percent of rapists will never spend a day in jail.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that kind of national landscape, I was enraged but not surprised to hear of two criminally negligent sexual assault sentences that were handed down this week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first was in connection with the 2012 Steubenville case. CNN reported Matt Belardine, a volunteer coach at Steubenville High School, was sentenced to 10 days in jail Tuesday after being found guilty of two misdemeanors: serving alcohol to minors and making a false statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose charges typically carry six-month sentences each, but after almost two years, I suppose we should be grateful that he is being held responsible at all. Belardine was the only adult present at the party at which two of his players raped a severely intoxicated 16-year-old girl. He’s also the first adult to be charged with anything in connection to her assault.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEven more infuriating that the paltry 240 hours he’ll spend in jail is the statement Belardine made alongside his sentencing: “It’s very unfortunate the events that transpired that night, you know, with the girl and everything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah. With the girl and everything. We know.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Steubenville case has become an icon of the horrifically maligned priorities in innumerable American communities where sports and crime are concerned. In addition to the sexual assault, multiple adults — coaches, school administrators — lied to authorities about the situation to protect the school’s football program. Belardine was an accomplice in a hideous crime and should spend more than\\r\\nthe length of a Disney Cruise behind bars.  \\r\\n\\r\\nOutrageously, a similar theme has been echoed in Montana. Stacey Rambold, a former high school teacher who served one month for raping a 14-year-old girl, was released last Thursday. The judge is now the target of national outrage for handing down such a lenient sentence to a crime with a mandatory minimum sentence of two to 10 years.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the last 20 years, 4.2 million Americans have been victims of sexual assault. However, the rate is falling. According to RAINN, had the 1993 rate held steady, that number would be 9.7 million. Awareness, education and empowerment have spared 5.5 million Americans in the last two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nObserve what’s left of Sexual Assault Awareness Month by remaining diligently cognizant of high-risk situations and the presence of consent. A little awareness and responsibility can go a long way toward eliminating the silent epidemic of sexual violence in America.\\r\\n\\r\\nsbkissel@indiana.edu\\r\\n@QueSarahSarah_',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Don’t Rape Guy wanted them to understand. But first, he had to convince them to care.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked up into another crowd of fraternity brothers. Most were required to be there. Some were members of a fraternity being punished. This time, they piled into an auditorium in Woodburn Hall. But wherever he met them — in their meeting rooms and lecture halls and basements of their pillared houses — they always asked the same question.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe saw it appear on the screen behind his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“how many sexual assaults were there last year? PLEASE ANSWER THIS” it read.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe questions were texted in anonymously, so the guys would feel comfortable asking what they wanted. What they really wanted, the Don’t Rape Guy thought, was a reason to dismiss the issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have the stats,” he said. “I know some of them. But I don’t think that we should have a certain number, or meet a certain threshold for this to be important. Right?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis brow furrowed and his voice grew louder. Everyone knows the statistic, he said.\\r\\nOne in five women who graduate from college have been sexually assaulted. He knows the guys don’t believe it, because they just don’t know many women who have been raped. Should he tell them that just because they don’t know it happened, doesn’t mean it never did?\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m tired of talking about the statistics,” he said, even louder now. “I’ve never heard anyone say that it’s one in seven. It’s always one in four, one in five.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But if it were one in seven, wouldn’t that still be a problem? If it was one in 10? One in 100?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took a breath, and another text appeared on the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“okay fine there is a problem. Tell us how to fix it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault is a crime IU has tried to curb for decades. During Little 500, the rise in alcohol use only makes the problem worse. So they try crisis lines and counseling sessions. Blue lights and police. Student groups and intervention workshops. Musicals about consent and bookmarks that say, “Passivity is often seen as permission.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this year, a student came to campus with a new idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat if we could stop rape from happening in the first place, by talking to the people who might rape?\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Don’t Rape Guy’s name is Mark Houlemarde. He’s a 26-year-old Ph.D. student studying higher education and student affairs. He dresses simply and speaks thoughtfully. He says “partner” instead of girlfriend, “fraternity men” instead of frat bros. He punctuates every few sentences with, “Right?” In front of crowds as big as 80 guys, it’s his way of asking them to think.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because no one in this room considers themselves to be a rapist, right?” he says.\\r\\nSince October, Mark’s job has been to seek out groups of men at IU to talk about not assaulting women.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost every minute of his presentations are interactive. He makes them move around, act out scenarios in role-playing games and most importantly, talk out loud about rape. Sometimes he draws an invisible line down the middle of the room and tells them to walk to the side that represents their opinion. Over here for yes, over there for no.\\r\\n\\r\\nCross the line, he’ll say, if you think someone can give consent while intoxicated. Always, about half go to each side.\\r\\n\\r\\nCross the line if you believe it’s a woman’s responsibility to determine how far a hookup or an intimate relationship should go. More move to “no,” but many cluster in the middle.\\r\\n\\r\\nCross the line if you believe sexual assault is an issue on this campus. All but a few move to yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark works primarily with fraternities. He doesn’t believe fraternities are the problem. Men are the problem, he says, and through fraternities, he can talk to large groups of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut according to the Office of Student Ethics, 46 percent of all reported rapes last school year were committed by a fraternity brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s 10 percent of the population causing almost half of all sexual assaults, Mark tells the guys.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome brothers listen attentively. Some play on their phones. Some answer his questions with enthusiasm. Some toss their McDonald’s wrappers like basketballs into the trash.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of them are hearing about men’s roles in the issue of sexual assault for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Women are told not to get raped,” Mark says. “But I don’t know if any men have actually been told, ‘Don’t rape somebody.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if they are, he says, the message is easily undermined by the idea of what men are expected to do in college — meet a lot of girls, get drunk, have sex.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So then it’s easy to avoid thinking about all the things that go into having sex,” he says. “The communication. The relationship with the other person.” \\r\\n\\r\\nMost men believe rape is wrong, he says, but it happens anyway. If he can help them understand how and why, he might be able to stop it before it’s too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe key is to teach consent. Mark offers them prompts and gets them to say out loud what he knows they need to hear.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour partner stops or is unresponsive.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If in any way the girl stops communicating with you, then that’s absolutely a stop,” a brother says.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou feel like you are getting mixed signals.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There needs to be better communication before you just go ahead.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYou intend to have sex by any means necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, uh, that sounds a little outrageous.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what about the spirit of it? Mark asks the group.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What about, ‘We’re gonna go out tonight, and we’re gonna get some pussy?’”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey hesitate. Then they start laughing. Out of Mark’s earshot, one guy says, “Aye!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean, if it happens, it happens,” someone replies.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nIn front of the crowd in Woodburn Hall, Mark had just finished ranting about statistics. He leaned back in his seat and let the other panelists keep talking as the audience’s eyes shifted to the screen. Questions were still appearing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why are women not held accountable,” one read.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the small groups of women in the crowd, arms crossed. Men started whispering to each other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“women should not be held accountable for rape. is a victim of murder accountable for provoking their attacker? nope. violence is violence.” a message read.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No accountability on women? Did u know that every accident in cars you are held minimally 10% at fault no matter wat”\\r\\n\\r\\nA brown-haired woman in the middle aisle stood up and raised her hand for the microphone.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a sophomore named Sara Hutson, but now was not the time for introductions.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So, someone sent in stuff about accountability for women,” she said, turning to face the crowd. “So, hi, guys. I’m one of your victims. And the perpetrator is, was, a pledge class leader for one of your fraternities.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe tried to get out the words to make them understand — what it was like, when he grabbed her from behind in the McNutt hallway — how she was scared of his temper, the time he bit her breast as she pushed him away — why she screamed, when she found him hiding behind her bed, eating pistachios and watching her undress.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People don’t report sexual assault because we’re afraid,” she said. “Because we know you. Mine was my next-door neighbor. So if I report it and nothing happens, what happens to me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMark and Sara had never met, but he has heard too many stories like hers. People ask him why he doesn’t bring women like her into his presentations. He knows her experiences might help men understand sexual assault is real. It might help them learn not to blame the victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe also knows most men wouldn’t see themselves in her story. Sexual assault on college campuses rarely plays out like rapes on TV, a stranger attacking an unsuspecting woman in a dark alley at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nRape in college is acquaintances at parties and friends of friends at the bar. It’s alcohol and feeling comfortable in the college town you call home. It’s not understanding how far a hookup is supposed to go. It’s not asking.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked at Sara. He looked at the guys. He wondered what it would take.\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nMark has known many women who have confided in him about being sexually assaulted. One of them happens to be his girlfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I met Mark, this was already something he cared deeply about,” she says now. “Even without me, Mark would still be doing this kind of work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe started working in sexual assault prevention as an undergraduate in California, years before he met her. It wasn’t a certain person or story or experience that got him going.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was learning rape was an issue and realizing that, as a man, he could do something about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This isn’t rocket science,” he likes to say. If he believed he was special to think this way, he wouldn’t try so hard to get other men to realize that they can think this way, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe doesn’t want to be the Don’t Rape Guy. He wants to be one of many.\\r\\nBut for now, his Sexual Assault Crisis Services job — which has no real title and technically is an internship — makes Mark the only man at IU whose position is solely dedicated to rape prevention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere’s no clear line between his work life and his personal life. Mark can’t ignore the warning signs everywhere on a college campus — parties with themes like CEO Bros and Office Hoes, guys discussing a girl’s ass on their way to the gym out-of-towners who visit IU just to party.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe can’t relax at most bars, so he just doesn’t go. The friend he hangs out with most is a former coworker who Mark guesses is in his 50s. He has never thought to ask. Sometimes they go bird watching.\\r\\n\\r\\nMark’s girlfriend worries about the sacrifices he’s made for this job. All of this, for $12 an hour?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” he told her, “If I don’t, who will?”\\r\\n\\r\\n* * *\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing the Don’t Rape Guy during the “World’s Greatest College Weekend” is about letting go.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis semester, Mark has spoken at two movie screenings, a conference in Indianapolis, a training for sorority sisters, eight planning meetings and 10 fraternity events.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut during Little 500, that all stops. All around campus, there are few educational events and no campus tours.  Some professors even cancel class. Academic life pauses, and the party starts.\\r\\n\\r\\nFraternities will day drink and throw late-night ragers. Kilroy’s will add extra cover charges and still pack the patio to the brim.\\r\\n\\r\\nPorches across town will be cleared for beer pong tables and Solo cups. By Wednesday, the emergency room at Bloomington Hospital will begin one of its busiest times of year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Mark will be at home. He really needs to catch up on classwork, he says. He won’t be at Dunnkirk, the ScHoolboy Q concert or the “Risky Business”-themed party on Third Street. It’s not that he hasn’t thought about it — but what would he do? Talk to drunk 20-year-olds? Look for the guys he’s seen in his presentations?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe’s told them not to rape. He just hopes they listened.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Today, the Indiana Daily Student published a story regarding the work of Mark Houlemarde, a Ph.D. student whose work involves speaking to men on campus about preventing sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story brings attention to alarming statistic — 46 percent of rapes on campus last year were committed by members of a fraternity, according to the Office of Student Ethics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were at least 35  sexual assaults reported in 2012 that occurred on IU property. The problem is that any sexual assaults that don’t happen on IU property do not have to be publicly disclosed. This means we’re getting only a fraction of the entire picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though not all of these crimes are exclusive to the greek system, we cannot ignore its part in this problem. Each year, the Student Organization Ethics Board provides a list of campus organizations on probation, suspended or expelled. Every organization on the current list is a fraternity. Yet on that list, an important piece of information is missing — the reason for the disciplinary action.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving people unaware of what offenses certain fraternities have committed in order to find themselves on judicial watch not only does a disservice to our greek system, but also to our campus at large.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s important to note that when something as atrocious as a rape is committed, it is committed by individuals, not an organization. But we cannot ignore the existing culture in some chapters on our campus and the role it ultimately has on the actual perpetrating of sexual violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is why the Editorial Board — composed of both greek and independent students — believes the Student Organization Ethics Board should make this knowledge public.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a fraternity is on probation because its members were found responsible for a sexual assault, students should be able to access this information so they can make an informed decision whether to attend events where they are at risk of predators.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the Ethics Board thinks by not releasing the cause of the disciplinary actions, they are protecting victims. But the organizations, which would have the most motivation to antagonize victims that get them into trouble, already know why they have been chastised. They know what and who got them in trouble, so further secrecy in the name of the victim is moot.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe aren’t asking for names or dates. We aren’t asking for descriptions. A simple box labeled “sexual assault” with a check beside it would serve our campus well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdding some public accountability would work as a preventative method. Fraternities and individuals don’t want to be labeled as sexual predators. So if the simple moral obligation doesn’t prevent attacks, perhaps the public shame and threat to their image will.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany students are already aware of the different reputations different greek organizations have in regard to sexual assault and other illegal activities. But incoming freshmen, who some might argue are already the most vulnerable because of their unfamiliarity with the college lifestyle, aren’t in the loop. They are sometimes left to learn where not to go the hard way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to prevent these situations, everyone should be aware of the infractions made by fraternities that are severe enough to result in probation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Editorial Board absolutely acknowledges not all fraternities, and certainly not all fraternity brothers, are guilty of sexual assault. But it would be naïve to think it isn’t a problem on this campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Student Organization Ethics Board were to be more transparent in regards to the specific infractions of fraternities on probation, the student body would be better able to know which chapters to avoid, instead of casting a wide net of suspicion over our entire greek system.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xadopinion@idsnews.com\\r\\n@IDS_opinion',\n",

       "  'body': 'Junior Eric Curbow has never been a victim of sexual assault or rape, but it’s an issue close to his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn his 21st birthday, Curbow’s friend was raped in her apartment. Curbow didn’t find out about the rape until a couple of days later.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s horrible and something no one should ever have to face, especially when you’re at home,” Curbow said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most difficult part about his friend’s assault, Curbow said, was seeing the emotional and mental toll it took on her. It’s something he said he never wants to see happen to anyone. So on Monday night, he took a stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurbow was one of many men and women who marched through the drizzling rain Monday in the 2014 Slut Walk, sponsored by the IU Women’s Student Association.\\r\\nSlut Walk is an international movement that seeks to end rape culture and stigmatization against women as instigators of rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe catalyst for this movement was Toronto Police Constable Michael Sanguinetti, who gave a statement in 2011 about the force’s views of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized,” Sanguinetti said in the statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe movement began in Toronto and was designed to convince the police force to change its stance out of respect to women, but Slut Walk has since broken into an international call for the end of rape culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreshman Morgan Mohr, the director of activism for WSA, said the event seeks to raise awareness for sexual assault at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s such a critical issue, especially here at IU where we have a huge underreporting of rape,” Mohr said. “The problem hasn’t gone away, and we aren’t going away either.”\\r\\nFor the IU event, women were encouraged to come dressed however they wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To show that rapists, not the victims, are at fault for rape,” a representative posted on the event’s Facebook page.\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen came donning bustiers and fishnet stockings with words like “My Body” and “Still Not Asking For It” scrawled on their bodies. More extreme participants came wearing opened button-down shirts with tape covering their nipples.\\r\\n\\r\\nTables were set up offering marchers materials and brochures on sexual assault and how to receive help at IU, courtesy of Counseling and Psychological Services at IU.\\r\\nThere were also stations to make banners to carry during the march, along with suggestions for messages to write.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost marchers didn’t need the suggestions to create their banners. Emily Gall, a junior studio art and art history major, held up a sign reading “There are no Blurred Lines — FUCK Robin Thicke.” She said her sign was both a testament to her hatred of Thicke and a critique of pop culture’s role in rape culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“His song’s just terrible, and everyone just keeps playing it over and over again,” Gall said. “Culture always tells guys ‘You need to get laid’ and ‘You need to be masculine and assertive,’ and for women it’s always ‘Shut up and don’t complain. You’re lucky you got laid.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the walk began, marchers heard speeches from club officers Connie Lu and Hannah Milner, as well as Stacy Weida, a prevention coordinator at Middle Way House.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe women talked about what the event means to them, and Weida shared the severity of sexual assault within the state.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The national average for girls in grades nine through 12 is 10.5 percent for rape,” she said. “In Indiana, 17.3 percent of women will be raped before they finish high school.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIndiana has the second-worst rate in the nation for sexual assault, Weida said.\\r\\n\\r\\nParticipants were encouraged to share their personal connections or reasons behind participating in the march by writing them on slips of paper. WSA officers Mohr and Carmen Vernon read the “Slut Statements” aloud to boost morale before the march.\\r\\n\\r\\nStatements denouncing rape as a societal problem or a result of the Republican movement perceived as a war on women earned overall approval from the crowd.\\r\\nOne comment from a rape victim received overwhelming applause and cheers from marchers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am here because my rapist tried to stop my spirits, but they failed,” Mohr read. “They don’t get to win. I do. I win every damn day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the march began, participants were warned to refrain from interacting with any members of Trad Youth, who had set up a protest of the march at the corner of Kirkwood and Indiana avenues. Supporters of the Slut Walk attempted to cover the Trad Youth protesters and their sign with sheets.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatthew Heimbach, a co-founder of Trad Youth, said the issue the group had was with slut culture, not with rape culture and sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We stand against both the slut culture and the bro culture that promotes sexual promiscuity amongst IU students,” Heimbach said. “We came to be able to encourage people to live a modest and chaste lifestyle, but also to stand against the rape culture.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTrad Youth protesters set up at 6 p.m. with signs reading “Against Rape Culture, Against Slut Culture, Slut Culture Hurts Everyone,” among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nTensions were high among Trad Youth members and Slut Walk supporters attempting to hide their protest. One woman holding a sheet felt her breast grazed by a Trad Youth member and angrily called him out on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that rape culture?” the Trad Youth member asked. “Do you feel triggered? You don’t look triggered.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut overall, the event was driven by a desire to empower people of all genders and sexual orientations and to bring down the walls instilled by traditional gender definitions, something Mohr said she knows all too well.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In my junior year in high school, my AP English teacher told me that I was going to be successful not because I was the smartest, but because I was attractive enough,” Mohr explained. “For me personally, this event is a huge source of empowerment.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'One of five college women will be sexually assaulted, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. This means that, statistically, about 745 women in the IU Class of 2017 will be victims of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides being an absolutely abhorrent snapshot of college life in the United States, this raises an important question.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, statistically, about 745 women in each graduating class will be victims of sexual assault, why have only about 120 sexual assaults been reported at IU from 2010 to 2012? The fact is that many cases will go unreported to authorities because of victim blaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 24th, 2011, a Toronto police officer, in response to rapes in Toronto, stated, “Women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this statement sprung the Toronto “SlutWalk,” a parade meant to protest the victim-blaming and slut-shaming that plague victims of sexual assault. Since then, SlutWalks have sprung up across the world, with one even in Bloomington happening each year. Protestors march with signs saying things such as “I’m not asking for it” and “Society Teaches Don’t Get Raped Instead Of Don’t Rape.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd what really makes an event like the SlutWalk so important is that it brings attention to the issue of sexual assault and how victims are not to blame. Unfortunately, with any good cause comes those who feel the need to attack victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Bloomington SlutWalk event page, a supposed member of the Traditionalist Youth Network, IU’s favorite hate-mongering student group, attacked the idea of SlutWalks in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man stated multiple times that though he doesn’t support rape culture, he thinks slut culture is also a problem. A member of the event said the man encouraged members of the SlutWalk to “put some clothes on, go to church, find a chivalrous man, have a family and stop being sluts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made it clear that TradYouth thinks a return to traditional gender roles of women being subservient to men will end rape culture. And it should bring to light that some people just don’t understand sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictims of sexual assault have the autonomy of their bodies forcibly taken from them. These victims are assaulted, they lose their sense of dignity and then are often blamed for it. SlutWalks aren’t designed to glorify dressing or acting in a certain way.\\r\\nThey’re designed to show that rape shouldn’t occur under any circumstance, regardless of the dress or behavior of the victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nTradYouth plans on protesting the SlutWalk in Dunn Meadow, and I pray they find the true meaning behind SlutWalks and accept it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, we don’t blame pedophilia on the way little girls dress, so we shouldn’t blame rape on the way women dress. Period.\\r\\n\\r\\najguenth@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'After attending a Step Up! IU training session, freshman Dayanna Arichavala wanted to share her new knowledge with everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis drove her to be host to Step Up! at La Casa Latino Cultural Center Thursday, where she has a work-study position.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After I heard the talk, I found myself being more vigilant,” Arichavala said. “I felt like it helped me a lot in assessing what goes on every day as I walk around campus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStep Up! IU is the action piece of Culture of Care, meaning they go to student groups and give trainings on bystander intervention, Step Up! Coordinator Thea\\r\\nCola said.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent groups can ask Step Up! to come to their meetings or events to give\\r\\neither a bystander intervention presentation or a sexual assault prevention presentation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe group teaches students how to create a safe environment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We want to increase confidence levels in students intervening,” Cola said. “In 2011 we surveyed IU students, and 66 percent thought that a problematic situation could’ve been avoided if someone intervened.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCulture of Care began collecting data and developing the Step Up! program, originally developed by the University of Arizona, for IU in 2011 and implemented it in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe need for the group came after incidents on campus like Lauren Spierer’s disappearance, Cola said, as well as a national address in which President Barack Obama said sexual assault was an issue he’d like to address.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis school year, the initiative has served 1,167 students at IU, Cola said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Incidents like sexual assault and hazing still occur even this year,” he said.\\r\\n“Culture of Care put this in for a reason. People don’t believe they have control of the environment, but they can create that culture of care and that’s what Step Up! is for. For encouraging students to take control of their environment.”\\r\\n\\r\\nArichavala said she sees intervention as an area that could be improved on campus and in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everybody has this idea that we’re such a big campus that anybody will help,” Arichavala said. “But in reality everybody has that mindset, so no one actually ends up helping, not only on this campus, but everywhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStep Up! is important to IU students as they transition into college life, Cola said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“College is a transitional period that can be tough,” Cola said. “Having someone smile at you or ask you if you’re OK can really go a long way. Intervening can really help people in the long run. It’ll make for an easier transition for students and help them have a better college experience.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCola said she wanted to stress how Step Up! is not a group that promotes only sobriety or abstinence, but rather tries to encourage safer practices.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not trying to crush fun,” Cola said. “It’s just trying to make fun safe.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Little 500 approaches, Step Up! gets flooded with requests to speak and do intervention training. Between now and the end of the academic year they have 10 planned sessions, Cola said.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, Culture of Care commissioned the Student Media Bureau to make a video about bystander intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe video is called “Bystanders,” and it staged events to see how IU students would react and if any would intervene.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome examples of the staged events included public harassment of a gay couple, a man harassing a woman and students crying alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The beauty of it was no matter what, if people intervened or not, we could still use it,” video producer Carlos Guiterrez said. “If they didn’t react we could say, ‘Look at this problem,’ and if they do that’s great.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents did end up intervening in the video, but at first Guiterrez said he was concerned people wouldn’t do so.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the beginning I was worried on the state of the human condition because for a while no one stopped,” Guiterrez said. “I had to listen to this girl cry and watch it on camera.\\r\\nIt was discouraging, but after people stepped up I felt more confident.”\\r\\nGuiterrez said he wished they would’ve staged more uncommon events to see what bystanders would do, such as a gay couple harassing a straight couple or a woman harassing a man. He said he’s also afraid the video was too “feel good.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m afraid people will see it and think, ‘Everything’s good, people stood up, I don’t need to do anything,’” he said. “But then again people still walked by and the stage guy who was crying wasn’t helped at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Guiterrez said he is happy with how it created a community.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From the responses I’ve gotten, a lot of people really expressed their pride about IU are proud of the students for stepping up,” Guiterrez said. “People were for at least one reason bound together and agreed on something.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The week of Little 500 is known as a “reproducible mass disaster” at the IU Health Bloomington Hospital Emergency Department.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe department calls in its entire staff to tackle the large influx of patients that fill its waiting room during the latter part of the week, Emergency Department Director Dr. Drew Watters said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA room is reserved specifically for drunk students. The students often have to wait six to eight hours before treatment because they are too drunk to speak coherently to nurses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s only so many beds in the ER,” Watters said. “There’s just no place to put them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcohol and sexual assault\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh amounts of alcohol consumption often occur hand-in-hand with higher numbers of sexual assault, Watters said. A large portion of the sexual assault cases the hospital receives involve IU students.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey often don’t know how much they’re drinking or where they’re drinking, said Brandy Summers, sexual assault nurse examiner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lose control, and this puts students at much higher risk of sexual assault.\\r\\nRegardless of the location or circumstances, nurses urge patients to come to the hospital as soon as possible after the sexual assault.  \\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to the hospital if you have been sexually assaulted\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a patient arrives within 96 hours of a sexual assault, they can receive a sexual assault forensic examination, often called a “rape kit.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout forensic evidence, it is more difficult for prosecutors to press criminal charges following a sexual assault. Time is of the essence, Watters said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA victim who receives a forensic examination is not required to report the sexual assault to the police. Forensic exams not given to the police are stored for a year under a specific case number. If the DNA is collected and stored, a victim can later decide to report the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’d rather collect it and not regret it,” Watters said. “Reporting is a huge step in the process to regaining independence.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSunday evenings or Monday mornings are the most common times that sexual assault victims visit the hospital, Summers said. These times fit within the 96-hour requirement, but the sooner victims come in, the more evidence they might have for their cases. \\r\\n\\r\\nShe urges sexual assault victims not to shower after an assault and, when possible, not to change clothes. She realizes this a difficult and counter-intuitive request for victims who have just experienced the trauma of a sexual assault. But each time a victim showers, more and more DNA gets washed away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happens at the hospital\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nurse takes the patient to a specific room — room 19. It’s where the hospital keeps all items necessary for sexual assault forensic examinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe or she tells the patient she is sorry this happened, that it is not the patient’s fault and that the recovery process starts now. The patient is in control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nurse then asks the patient to tell them what happened. Where did it take place — in a bed, a car, the floor of an apartment? Were you physically coerced — were you restrained, shoved, abducted, choked? What were you wearing at the time, and what types of sexual acts did the perpetrator commit?\\r\\n\\r\\n“When we ask you, ‘Did they bite you?’ we’re not saying, ‘Did you bite back?’” Summers said. “We’re looking for where we can find DNA.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSummers realizes that when a victim describes sexual assault, it’s like he or she is being assaulted all over again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatters said he tries not to push patients to tell him what happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t care what happened sexually,” Watters said. “I will assume everything was done. My perspective is on the wellness of the body.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient is then asked whether or not they would like to report the sexual assault to the police. If a patient decides not to, Summers said she aims to find out why.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, it’s because they knew the perpetrator well. Other times it’s because they don’t trust the legal system.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery patient copes with the stress of a sexual assault differently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some just want to get it over with, some are hysterical, some are laughing,” Summers said. “The patient who is laughing and giggling is treated the same as the person who is crying hysterically.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient is offered the chance to work with Bloomington-based Middle Way House, a domestic violence program and rape crisis center, to receive support and legal advocacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, the nurse will begin the sexual assault forensic examination process, if the patient decides to proceed with it. She takes a blood sample from the patient and then begins collecting external DNA.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We start least invasive to most invasive,” Summer said. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf it’s been less than six hours since oral contact, the nurse flosses the patient’s teeth and collects swabs from the mouth. She takes finger nail scrapings, in case the patient was able to scratch the perpetrator.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient is asked to comb his or her own hair to look for hairs that don’t belong.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe patient is then asked to remove all clothing except undergarments, if they’re willing. The nurse asks to keep the patient’s underwear as evidence, providing a replacement pair.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looks for any visible injuries, and she uses a special black light to search for bodily fluids on the skin. She then performs the genital exam, gathering DNA from the patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next steps\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all evidence is documented, the nurse offers the patient medication for STD prevention. If it’s been within about three days, the nurse offers emergency contraception, also known as Plan B.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe then helps prepare the patient for recovery. If the patient is a student, the nurse helps arrange for a follow-up with the Sexual Assault Crisis Service through IU Health Center’s Counseling and Psychological Services.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If they call while they’re here, they’re more likely to go to SACS,” Summers said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IU Health Center also offers two trained nurses who can perform sexual assault forensic examinations, but they are only available during business hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost importantly, Summers urges students to be careful and responsible. She tells students never to leave friends by themselves at parties.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ve had some people say, ‘She was fine, so we just left her at the party,’” Summers said. “They’re leaving her in unknown territory.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe encourages students to seek blunt consent before having sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysical cues are not enough — both individuals must give verbal confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if a sexual assault does happen, Watters said the best thing a patient can do is respond as quickly as possible. \\r\\n\\r\\n“If something happens, it is not the end,” Watters said. “It is just the beginning.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Representatives from the IU Student Association and members of the Purdue student government met with all the Indiana senators and representatives Tuesday to discuss higher education issues in Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome hot-button issues included higher education affordability, immigration, student mental health and the prevention of sexual assault on campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a lot of open dialogue about these issues and getting our input on it,” said Christopher Kauffman, vice president of administration for IUSA. “It was an idea-sharing session.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIUSA executive members were given 30 to 40 minutes to speak with each representative or representatives’ staff members.\\r\\n\\r\\nKauffman said the legislators were receptive to what IUSA and Purdue student government members had to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Legislators believe in students and want to hear from students,” Kauffman said. “If you can bring student voice to the table in a respectful and effective manner, then a lot of people are willing to listen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIUSA President Jose Mitjavila said the most important issue they discussed was the need to renew the Higher Education Act to keep student loan interest rates at a manageable rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis would also ensure Pell Grants and Unsubsidized and Subsidized Stafford Loans are still options for students.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey discussed the need for more flexible and reasonable loan repayment programs, such as income-based repayment, which would mean that students could repay their loans based on a percentage of their income.\\r\\n\\r\\nKauffman said this would make it easier for poor students out of college to pay back their debt.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you leave IU with a lot of debt and you have to pay a flat 10-percent interest rate, that ends up being a sizeable portion of your income and makes it hard to live,” Kauffman said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMitjavila said IUSA members also lobbied for increased enforcement of the Cleary Act, which requires universities to report sexual assaults on campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ideally, we would like regulation that incentivizes increased reporting by universities so that the public can get a better grasp of the actual number of sexual assaults on campus,” Mitjavila said. “The Cleary Act is not strictly enforced, leaving less incentive for universities to do so and potentially creating a system for under-reporting.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKauffman said this event demonstrated college student governments have the power to make change by bringing issues directly to the legislators.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think, in the future, it’s making sure that we are ever-present in front of state and federal legislature to make sure that they know these are priorities to students,”\\r\\nKauffman said. “These are problems that need to be solved. It is about awareness, but it’s also about persistence in generating that awareness.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'When Beyoncé’s surprise album dropped a few months ago, the reviews were glimmering and golden.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that her music videos have come out on YouTube, that’s sort of stopped.\\r\\nAs Beyoncé leaned her cat-suit clad frame across tables and stair rails, many began questioning her media image and feminist philosophy, most notably figures like Fox News and Bill O’Reilly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe all know where that’s going to lead us, but it’s good to address this criticism regardless of however extreme the news outlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a track like “Flawless (feat. Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche),” it became easy to see Beyoncé’s message as hypocritical. People asked how she could fight for women’s rights and equality when she dresses up in diamond body suits and talks about having consensual, marital sex with her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, actually, she can.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyoncé represents, for me, a new wave of feminism. It is not about trying to gain the sexual freedom of a man, or express oneself the way a man would. It’s about celebrating the feminine genius.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyoncé also joined forces with Condoleezza Rice and Jane Lynch for Sheryl Sandberg’s “Ban Bossy” campaign, which addresses stereotypes and stigmas that hold women back — a campaign I am also totally behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe wants people to realize women do not have to lose their femininity or sex appeal to gain equality or positions of power. The new fight must be fighting for femininity.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if being a woman means others discriminate against her and prevents her from gaining human rights, women should not have to give up their womanhood. Oppressors must change their points of view. It’s this strange, wishy-washy middle ground of feminism that makes more sense to me than the extreme feminist views of the 60s and 70s, or the polarizing actions of radical groups like Femen.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, for one, don’t really feel the need to paint derogatory sayings across my stomach, run onto catwalks, assault and insult models and scream at the attending crowd that I need rights because I need them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t really think acting absolutely insane is going to do much for my movement. Beyoncé, however, is exactly the direction I want to be moving in.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of saying women must be equal in the way that men are equal, that women must be able to sleep with whoever they want and avoid marriage and children and become as ruthless as the nearest business magnate, she wants to turn the discussion to one that celebrates what women have done and will do.\\r\\n\\r\\nFemininity must be celebrated, not stigmatized. With more figures like Beyoncé in the media, that is what will, hopefully, happen.\\r\\n\\r\\newenning@indiana.edu\\r\\n@EmmaWenninger',\n",

       "  'body': 'Representatives from the IU Student Association and members of the Purdue student government met with all the Indiana senators and representatives Tuesday to discuss higher education issues in Indiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome hot-button issues included higher education affordability, immigration, student mental health and the prevention of sexual assault on campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a lot of open dialogue about these issues and getting our input on it,” said Christopher Kauffman, vice president of administration for IUSA. “It was an idea-sharing session.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIUSA executive members were given 30 to 40 minutes to speak with each representative or representatives’ staff members.\\r\\n\\r\\nKauffman said the legislators were receptive to what IUSA and Purdue student government members had to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Legislators believe in students and want to hear from students,” Kauffman said. “If you can bring student voice to the table in a respectful and effective manner, then a lot of people are willing to listen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIUSA President Jose Mitjavila said the most important issue they discussed was the need to renew the Higher Education Act so student loan interest rates are kept at a manageable rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis would also ensure Pell Grants and Unsubsidized and Subsidized Stafford Loans are still options for students.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey discussed the need for more flexible and reasonable loan repayment programs, such as income-based repayment, which would mean that students could repay their loans based on a percentage of their income.\\r\\n\\r\\nKauffman said this would make it easier for poor students out of college to pay back their debt.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you leave IU with a lot of debt and you have to pay a flat 10 percent interest rate, that ends up being a sizeable portion of your income and makes it hard to live,” Kauffman said.\\r\\n\\r\\nMitjavila said IUSA members also lobbied for increased enforcement of the Cleary Act, which requires universities to report sexual assaults on campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ideally, we would like regulation that incentivizes increased reporting by universities so that the public can get a better grasp of the actual number of sexual assaults on campus,” Mitjavila said. “The Cleary Act is not strictly enforced, leaving less incentive for universities to do so and potentially creating a system for under-reporting.”\\r\\n\\r\\nKauffman said this event demonstrated college student governments have the power to make change by bringing issues directly to the legislators.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think, in the future, it’s making sure that we are ever present in front of state and federal legislature to make sure that they know these are priorities to students,” Kauffman said. “These are problems that need to be solved. It is about awareness, but it’s also about persistence in generating that awareness.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'A column written by an anonymous source went live on the Harvard Crimson’s website March 31. And it’s changing how we talk about sexual assault on college campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear Harvard: You Win” is an extremely powerful first-person account of woman’s experience through the long and excessively difficult process after being sexually\\r\\nassaulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crux of the letter written to the university is the idea that, due to Harvard’s inefficiency, the student will be dropping out in order to save her life. She claims that the university’s inactivity has caused her to develop a mental illness.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went to the proper outlets and told her story, but nobody truly listened. All of the appropriate people were in place by the university — the house master, the administrative board, sexual assault and harassment tutors — yet the woman was still never really helped.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd something tells me that this case isn’t solely limited to Harvard University, although the idea of it happening at such a prestigious university does help level the playing field for the larger issue at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe suppress sex and are so overwhelmingly sex-negative that we end up always thinking about sex. Ever since philosopher Michel Foucault pointed it out, it seems that we can’t get away from the idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I feel that rape and sexual assault are the opposite. We spend so much time talking about sexual assault and generally knowing it’s out there that we don’t actually delve into the topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue, talking about the issue is better than not talking about it at all. But more and more, I’ve realized that we expose these sexual assault stories to no real avail.\\r\\nThis Monday, the Indiana Daily Student reported about a rape. As I walk past newsstands, I saw the article on the front cover, thought about how it was sad and moved on with my day.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue, part of this is my flaw. But we’re so inundated with these tales and half-followed reports that end up going nowhere that sexual assault seems to become nonchalant, a topic brought up in a recent column by Jordan Riley.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone’s talking, but no one is really saying anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s hard to see who we are actually helping. We need to be more thorough with sexual assault training at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don’t actively seek out information about rape and sexual assault. What I see around campus is nothing more than blanket statements about consensual sex, but I already learned that during the Welcome to College musical at orientation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe could all do more to start real conversations about sexual assault. Let’s stop creating after-school specials and delve into meaningful, nuanced conversation more often.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fear that we, like Harvard, have all the cards in place, but we won’t know what to do when we actually need to play them.\\r\\n\\r\\nsjostrow@indiana.edu\\r\\n@ostrowski_s_j',\n",

       "  'body': 'As Kaelyn Siversky walked along a beach on what she called a first date, her date said he forgot his wallet and needed to go back to his boat to get it, inviting her to accompany him.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was 15 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When we got there, he went from being a very gentle, kind person, to being very overpowering,” Siversky said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she tried to leave, her attacker began to hit and kick her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He undressed me. He tied my hands behind my back and he assaulted me,” she said. “I felt very worthless after that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSiversky is now the executive director of Project Unbreakable, an organization that raises awareness of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and Grace Brown, founder of Project Unbreakable, brought photographs from Project Unbreakable to IU to have a discussion about sexual assault and kick off Culture of Care Week.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown began Project Unbreakable in October 2011 as a way for sexual assault survivors to take back the words of their attackers and help the healing\\r\\nprocess.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I started this project as a way of bringing awareness to this issue,” Brown said. “There wasn’t a lot in the media.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea came to her in photography school, while she was speaking with a friend who was assaulted at 14 years old, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could see her eyes and I could see her crumbling,” Brown said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said when she brought the idea to her friend and she agreed, she decided to begin Project Unbreakable. If her friend did not agree, there would be no project.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown and her friend posted a photo of her friend holding a poster with a quote from her attacker.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the first photo was placed on the Internet, Brown said people started asking to participate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I realized it was creating awareness, but it was also part of the healing process,” she\\r\\nsaid. “It was a way to take back the words that were said to them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSiversky heard about the project from a friend and was scheduled to be photographed, but said she never went. Instead, she applied to be a part of the Project Unbreakable team.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said the people at Project Unbreakable were the first to fully accept her story as true immediately, instead of questioning her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is nothing in this world like that feeling of support,” Siversky said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown said survivors of sexual assault are often not believed by their peers or family.\\r\\nOne of the reasons she began Project Unbreakable was because she fully believed her\\r\\nfriend who was assaulted at 14 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrown and Siversky broke the silence that resonated through the room with shocking statistics about sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly 3 percent of attackers will spend a day in jail, Brown said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSiversky said more than one-third of minors who were assaulted will be assaulted again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 25 percent of male survivors were assaulted by the age of 10, Brown said.\\r\\nThe project, Brown said, is not just about statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It puts a person behind a statistic and it makes the concept of sexual assault not this floating object,” Brown said. “It puts a face behind the numbers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nConsent was another subject discussed through the photographs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One of the things I find most interesting in discussing ways to end sexual assault is the discussion of consent,” Siversky said. “It is a really difficult thing to ask for, and it’s also a really difficult thing to give.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said through the photos, she notices a common theme about consent.\\r\\n“Just because you’ve agreed to something at one point, does not mean you’ve agreed\\r\\nto it at any other point,” Siversky said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with consent and other themes, she said society still has archaic ideas of gender roles.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is still this pressing idea that (there has to be a) submissive partner in any\\r\\nrelationship,” Siversky said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea of the submissive and the dominant is often seen in sexual assault and in the photographs, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, Siversky said, there is corrective rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrective rape is sexual assault in which the attacker rapes the victim in order to “correct” their sexuality or gender identity, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It happens very often and it is considered a hate crime as well as sexual assault,” Siversky said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe silence reigned in the room during the entire presentation. Brown said she understands how difficult it can be to look at the photographs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know that sitting in this audience can make you want to lose your faith in humanity,” Brown said. “But you can’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said people are becoming advocates for sexual assault survivors instead of bystanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe project often brings about questions of hope for sexual assault survivors and how Brown and Siversky find hope in the photographs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s made of hope, it’s made of healing, it’s these people taking these words back,” Brown said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSiversky said giving a voice to the survivors instead of silencing the stories is hope.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These survivors, they are hope,” Siversky said. “These people telling their stories, that’s what hope is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Allison Wagner on Twitter @allmwagn.',\n",

       "  'body': 'It is amazing how nonchalant some people are when it comes to addressing the horrible act of rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne in five high school aged girls in Indiana have been sexually assaulted, and yet there continues to be an attitude of victim distrust and predator coddling.\\r\\nThe Indiana Supreme Court just decided upon a case that, while unfathomable to me, perfectly embodies this attitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a 16-year-old student came to her principal minutes after being sexually assaulted on school grounds, he neglected to call the police because he was didn’t believe her. According to a March 31 IDS article, he found time to look at hours of security footage, search both students’ lockers and demand a written statement from the victim before someone else had to insist that she be taken to the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though protocol and human decency insist the principal call the police immediately, he refused to do so. He later claimed he was unaware he had to contact the police directly. Perhaps he was hoping to rely on the police force’s psychic powers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn top of his blatant disregard for the wellbeing of the victim in his care, he also handled the predator with a lax and sympathetic hand, even though the victim was certain and clear that he was her attacker. The school’s athletic director was even invited to sit in, showing the lack of serious intent.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen students are in school, they are under the guardianship of the principal and the authority structure of that school. How can students be expected to feel safe when their wellbeing is so clearly disregarded by those authorities? How can female students be expected to feel protected when their schools don’t take their claims or safety seriously?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis nonchalance toward high school sexual assault must be addressed because it puts students at risk. It not only teaches young people that if they are attacked the authorities may be unwilling to help or sympathize with them, but that also being a sexual predator is not a big deal and will not be treated harshly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’m sure everyone remembers the Stuebenville case. News reporters were much more concerned with the injustice against the young rapists then those against the actual victim. This is exactly the kind of attitude that breeds predators. No other crime of this caliber would have the perpetrators being painted as victims. No other situation would have high school principles treating the victims as the untrustworthy party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis state, and American society as a whole, needs to reassess its attitude towards rape and its victims, especially as it affects minors.\\r\\nSexual assault is not typical teenage behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s time administrators wake up to the fact that it is happening and the harm it does.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s time they stop treating victims like liars and rapists like naughty children. We need to put the blame where it belongs, and help the victims where we can. Maybe this change in attitude can change the statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\njordile@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Three and a half years ago, a 16-year-old girl at Muncie Central High School was dragged into a school bathroom and raped by another student during her lunch period. Her attacker then returned to finish lunch with his friends. The girl, crying and bleeding, went to the front office to report the assault to the principal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happened next led to a legal debate that went all the way to the Indiana Supreme Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday, the Court issued a stinging rebuke to the principal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuncie Central High School’s principal, Christopher Smith, never called the police that day. Though several police officers were on campus, Smith didn’t tell any of them, either.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe principal wasn’t sure whether he believed the girl’s account. Even after someone else drove the girl to the hospital, he ignored repeated suggestions that the case was a police matter. He never blocked off the bathroom where the rape occurred, resulting in a contaminated crime scene. He questioned the rapist briefly, but then allowed him to go home.\\r\\n\\r\\nProsecutors charged Smith with failing to immediately report an instance of child abuse to authorities. A trial judge found him guilty and sentenced him to 120 days probation and 100 hours community service. A year later, the verdict was overturned on appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday, the Indiana Supreme Court reinstated the principal’s conviction and reprimanded him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When time was of the essence, Smith dawdled, delayed and did seemingly everything he could to not contact DCS or the police,” Justice Steven David wrote for the majority. “Whether this failure was out of ignorance, a desire to protect the reputation of the perpetrator or perhaps a wish to keep his school from receiving negative publicity on his watch is not clear.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapist, then-16-year-old Steven Moore, admitted to the rape six days after the investigation started. He was sentenced to five years with four years executed and one year probation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith’s court decision came barely a week after a girl at Lawrence Central High School reported being raped in a gymnasium during school hours.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen parents send their children to school, most assume their children are safe under the guardianship of teachers and administrators. That assumption of safety could be misplaced.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor two years, the Center for Disease Control found Indiana has the second-highest percentage of high school girls reporting they’ve been sexually assaulted. While 10.5 percent of high school girls throughout the nation report they’ve been sexually assualted, that number is closer to 18 percent in Indiana — nearly one in five.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis does not include the fact that up to half of sexual assaults likely go unreported, said Anita Carpenter, CEO of the Indiana Coalition Against Sexual Assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are probably sexual assaults that are happening in high school campuses that we don’t know about and would be totally shocked to know about, because we’re shocked about the ones we do know about,” Carpenter said. “When we have perpetrators sexually assaulting another student in the middle of the school day, that’s a problem.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the days and weeks following the rape at Muncie Central, detectives interviewed all people involved to piece together what happened before, during and after the rape was reported. Based on police reports, testimonies and more than 600 pages of court documents, here is what happened Nov. 9, 2010:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl who was raped was already considered by the school to be at-risk. She was under the guardianship of a youth home, and school officials knew she needed more attention than the average student.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat day, assistant principal Kathy McCord and three school security officers were patrolling the lunchroom. McCord saw Moore and the girl together in the hallway and asked them where they were going. Moore replied he was going to the library, while the girl answered, “the gym locker room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, the girl said in her statement Moore then followed her to her locker.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come here,” he said to her, in the hallway near the locker room.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did, and he pulled her into the boys’ restroom and raped her. After he left, the girl moved to the girls’ restroom and discovered she was bleeding.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in the cafeteria, McCord saw Moore return just in time for the bell to ring. The cafeteria was so crowded, she didn’t stop him as he followed the crowd toward his next class.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl eventually left the restroom and saw her friend. She asked the friend if she had any extra clothes, and the friend saw the girl was crying. With some prodding, the girl told her friend she had been raped. The friend insisted they tell someone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCord had just returned to the main office when the girl came in with a friend, at 12:20 p.m. She was visibly upset, and the friend had an arm around her. McCord took both girls into her office and listened to the story as the girl cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCord told the principal. He asked the girl who had done it. Without hesitation, she said, “Steven Moore.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, within five to 10 minutes of the report, Smith and others questioned the girl’s claim, given she had allegedly faked a seizure earlier in the year and lied about an attendance issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith radioed the school nurse to come to the office, not to examine the girl, but because Smith said he wasn’t sure what the girl needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sent McCord to review video evidence of the hallway where the girl said the rape occurred, which took more than an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith asked the girl for a written statement. She wrote hers without uncertainty, describing how Moore had put his hand over her face during the attack and ignored her pleas.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was like, ‘Stop Steven,’” she wrote, “but I didn’t want to be loud because I didn’t want to draw attention.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 2 p.m., a representative from the girl’s group home took the girl to a hospital for a sexual assault exam. Smith tried to call the school system superintendent to see if a security officer should be involved, but Smith could not reach him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfterward, Smith called Moore to the office, and he invited the athletic director to sit in on his conversation. Moore said he hadn’t had sex with the girl, but they had exchanged sexually explicit notes. Smith allowed Moore to go back to class.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Moore’s and the girl’s lockers were searched. Graphic notes were found, but none were signed. At the end of the day, Moore went home.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce both students were out of the main office, Smith and others resumed their interviews for an open administrator position.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasn’t until 4:30 p.m that Sloan called the Child Abuse Hotline for Smith to report the incident. The operator advised him to call law enforcement. Neither Sloan nor Smith ever did.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour later, Smith went to the hospital to check on the girl, but left after 40 minutes to attend a school board meeting where he recognized several coaches and the volleyball team.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this time, more than 10 adults knew a student had reported a rape, and not one of them reported it to the Muncie Police Department to report it. Three different people had suggested to Smith personally that he contact police.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmith said he did not know that he had to contact the police directly, or that under Indiana state law sexual contact between minors is usually considered child abuse, which must be reported “immediately.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis defense said he thought “immediately” meant within 24 hours of the report.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to this, Judge Thomas Cannon read to him from the Webster dictionary in court, defining “immediately” as, “in an immediate manner; specifically, a) without intervening agency or cause; directly; b) without delay; at once; instantly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Under the facts of this case,” Justice David wrote in the Supreme Court ruling, “no reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would have difficulty determining whether or not Smith acted with a sense of urgency or primacy of purpose.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Smith still works for the Muncie School Corporation as an adult education teacher at Muncie-Work One. During an interview with detectives 10 days after the incident in 2010, once details of the events began to become clear, detectives asked Smith if he would have called police sooner, if he had the chance to go back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I had to do it over again,” he told them, “I probably would.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Hannah Smith on Twitter @hannsmit.',\n",

       "  'body': 'President Barack Obama announced in January that one in five women — 20 percent — are sexually assaulted during their time at college. Leslie Fasone wants to lower that percentage at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nFasone accepted the position as the new assistant dean three weeks ago for Women’s and Gender Affairs, within the division of student affairs. She will continue to advise the Culture of Care initiative, while fulfilling her new role in the Dean of Students Office.\\r\\n\\r\\nFasone will work in the area of women’s affairs and will develop programming that relates to improving the conditions on campus for women, as well as addressing the issue of sexual assault on campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said her passion for women’s affairs became an important part of her life when she went to college at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I was an undergrad, I had a number of friends who were sexually assaulted,” Fasone said. “I remember some distinct experiences where they would talk to me and they didn’t realize what had happened to them until they were talking to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a member of the women’s fraternity, Kappa Alpha Theta, Fasone said she became involved with the Panhellenic Association and sexual assault prevention in the sorority community at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter college, she traveled to different Theta chapters to work with women’s groups on developing leadership skills and risk management skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, she returned to IU and worked in the greek community for the next six years.\\r\\nWhile she was there, she received her master’s degree in mental health counseling and worked with students at the Alcohol and Drug Office.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Those skills are very transferable to what I am doing now, especially when I work with any student who may have mental health issues or are victims of sexual assault,” Fasone said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen issues of substance abuse or sexual assault would arise, she said she noticed a pattern that may have allowed peers to intervene and help. This idea is what fueled the development of the bystander intervention program at IU.\\r\\n\\r\\nFasone said bystander intervention is one of the four most effective strategies suggested to prevent sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have two programs now for bystander intervention,” Fasone said. “One is general focus to teach students ways to intervene in different situations in terms of alcohol and drug use, mental health, respect, sexual assault and hazing. Then we also have the sexual assault focused program.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin her new role, Fasone will create programming to combat issues regarding sexual assault and make students aware of resources to help them in a dangerous situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think one of the aspects when it comes to women’s issues and sexual assault — and bystander intervention, even — is that so many of these behaviors among college students are intertwined,” Fasone said. “Women who have been sexually assaulted are more likely to use greater substances, alcohol use, and they are also likely to experience PTSD — Post Traumatic Stress Disorder — and have other mental health issues.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said student issues are all intertwined since students who are stressed may abuse alcohol in order to cope.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The way I like to approach programming for students is to be very strategic and figure out what the students need,” Fasone said. “I’m very hands on because I think students have a lot of insight into their culture, and I think that their culture isn’t going to change unless students take the lead in changing that.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFasone said while she believes the University is good at responding to sexual assault, IU could improve on proactive programming.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said that makes sexual assault prevention programming a top priority.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Another aspect of this is really bringing the students together to be able to address this cultural issue,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFasone said she wants to help students, staff and faculty to navigate services offered at IU, such as the Sexual Assault Crisis Service. The counseling the crisis center offers is free and has room for more utilization, she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I strongly believe in counseling as an avenue for students and people to process and heal,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy identifying what the students think are issues, she said she can better develop priorities for programming and initiatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssociate Dean Carol McCord said the programming offered will address the needs and issues of women on campus, but students need to reach out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are very willing to hear from people, and Leslie will respond to anyone who reaches out to her,” McCord said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Fasone is just in the initial stage of research and development for her new programs, McCord said Fasone is great at program development and evaluation and is\\r\\nlooking for suggestions from students.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My goal is to figure out how to prevent sexual assaults from happening,” Fasone said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe services and programs offered by the Office of the Dean of Students are available to graduate students as well, which is something graduate students don’t always realize, McCord said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Dean of Students Office supports all students, but this gives us an opportunity to provide more than just responsive support, and to put more attention into looking for programming that might offset problems women students might have,” McCord Said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Allison Wagner on Twitter @allmwagn.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Representation Project, the team behind the award-winning “Miss Representation” documentary, is gearing up for another project.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film in question is an in-depth analysis of the mental health of young men in America. This documentary is one of the first real attempts I’ve seen in a long time to understand and appreciate the development of the young adult male in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film, “The Mask You Live In,” argues the three most destructive words you can say to a young boy are, “Be a man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis phrase implies that young men must constantly prove themselves. Showing they are a “man,” according to what we have defined men to be — big, strong, not prone to emotion or sensitivity, willing to fight and unable to form attachments — is what the phrase embodies in our society.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a boy is not given the approval he needs, if he cannot fulfill his role or if he seems in any way emotional, sensitive or anything else we have made inherently “effeminate,” he has failed in his role.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis vicious cycle can lead to health problems, violence and death.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wrote a column a few weeks ago about the benefits of the Men Against Rape program, which teaches members of the greek community about sexual assault and\\r\\nviolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think this film is another excellent way in which we can create a dialogue about men’s mental health. It allows us to explore the underlying causes of violence perpetrated by young men, and it helps us understand how to help and better the\\r\\nproblem.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, the issue is very much a lack of real education and discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of the focus is on young women — and for good reason. But boys, it seems, are not the priority. When there is a lack of education, there is a lack of problem-solving.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer then becomes jail, community service or juvenile detention.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese programs and institutions, while beneficial, are easy ways out. Programs do not do the hard work right at the start, which could include mental health programs, a renewed focus on men’s health and teaching boys about how to avoid violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe wait until they explode and commit a crime, and then we punish them.\\r\\nI hope this film begins to create an equal discussion around of both men’s and women’s health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two issues are equally important.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we can begin looking at them without gender bias and sexism, we can start to tackle and hopefully change some important issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll be keeping my eye on the Representation Project.\\r\\n\\r\\newenning@indiana.edu\\r\\n@EmmaWenninger',\n",

       "  'body': 'Same-sex marriage, guns in schools, expanding protections of the Lifeline Law — the topics handled by the Indiana General Assembly this session ran the gamut.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legislative session ended just before IU’s spring break. During the course of two and a half months, state legislators considered divisive questions like constitutional amendments and the kinds of decisions that are made unanimously in both the Senate and House of Representatives.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The work we have done has built on the success of the last legislative session and, I believe, will lead to a more prosperous future for Indiana,” Republican Gov. Mike Pence told the members of the General Assembly in an end-of-session address March 13. “And Hoosiers will be glad to know that most of what we accomplished was passed with broad and bipartisan support.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPence detailed successes in pre-kindergarten and the economy, but he didn’t speak about controversial same-sex marriage measures or other, more divisive questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are the four biggest things that happened — or didn’t happen — in the 2014 session.\\r\\n\\r\\nSame-sex marriage\\r\\nOne of the session’s most controversial issues was a measure to put language in the state constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a similar measure was passed by the last General Assembly, this session’s votes were the last hurdle before the amendment would be sent to voters for final approval. Interest groups throughout the state lined up on either side of the issue, including IU, which opposed the amendment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a significant language change in the House, which eliminated provisions banning “a legal status substantially similar to marriage,” means the amendment won’t be presented to voters in November, even though it passed both houses. The earliest voters could see it is 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporters argued the amendment, which would solidify existing state law, is important to prevent judges making legal changes as other states have done, including, most recently, Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpponents said adding roadblocks for same-sex marriage would be bad for the state’s economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, few legislators really got what they wanted. The measure passed, but it was significantly weakened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m a big fan of one-man-one-woman marriage, and I’m a big fan of the language we voted on in 2011,” Sen. Scott Schneider, R-Indianapolis, said before voting yes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sometimes you have to learn to take half a loaf instead of the whole loaf.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLifeline Law expansion\\r\\nThe Lifeline Law, which grants immunity for underage individuals who call 911 under the influence of alcohol, was expanded to protect people in more situations.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It expands your protections if you’ve been using alcohol or drugs and you’re reporting a medical emergency, or you’re the victim of a sexual assault or you’ve witnessed a crime and you’re reporting that crime,” Sen. Mark Stoops, D-Bloomington, said when the law passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore, Lifeline only applied to medical emergencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, steps have been taken to allow police and prosecutors some wiggle room when considering individuals who call 911 under the influence of illegal drugs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the creation in 2011 and expansion this year of the Lifeline Law, university student governments, including the IU Student Association, have been involved by testifying before the General Assembly and working with legislators on developing language.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuns at school\\r\\nIn the final days of the session, legislators approved a law that allows guns in school parking lots.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder existing state law, having a gun anywhere on school grounds is a felony, but the new law allows employees and high school students who are members of gun clubs to possess firearms in their locked cars in the parking lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill passed the Senate 38-10 after conference committee and then the House 75-24.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacked by the National Rifle Association and gun-rights advocates, supporters said the bill is necessary to protect teachers’ and students’ Second Amendment rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpponents, meanwhile, argued that guns should not be on school grounds or that school districts ought to be given the power to decide whether their parking lots would be gun-free.\\r\\n\\r\\nPre-kindergarten vouchers\\r\\nIndiana approved a program that would use state funds to help low-income families pay for pre-kindergarten education from private schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s part of a nation-wide consideration of if and how to fund preschool. President Obama discussed it in his State of the Union address this year, and Gov. Mike Pence put the measure forward as one of his primary goals for the session.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program is a pilot that could be expanded if successful. It would give as much as $10 million per year to needy families, a range of $2,500 to $6,800 per child.\\r\\n\\r\\nPence and the state’s Republicans have been advancing a large-scale school voucher program that uses state funds to help pay tuition at private schools in the state, which the pre-K pilot falls into.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Last year, we expanded opportunities for low-income kids to attend the school of their choice,” Pence said. “This year, for the first time ever, Indiana has funded pre-K education so low-income kids can start school ready to learn.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'On Thursday, the United States Senate debated a bill that would take sexual assault cases and other major civilian crimes out of the military chain of command by allowing military trial lawyers to decide whether or not to bring those cases to the courts-martial.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill, sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., was fiercely debated in the Senate before it was defeated in a 55-45 vote, falling short of the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIndiana’s Senators were split on the issue at hand. Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., voted in favor of the bill. Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., voted against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, 26,000 men and women in the military were sexually assaulted. “The Invisible War,” a documentary about military sexual assault, explains how many of these sexual assaults are perpetrated by ranking officers in the military.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current system places these same ranking officers in charge of deciding whether or not to bring a sexual assault case to trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nGillibrand argued the bill was designed to protect men and women in the military from sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany female senators, most of who voted for the bill, questioned whether or not the male-dominated military leadership understands how to deal with sexual assault\\r\\neffectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side of the debate, senators argued removing commanding officers from the chain of command would damage morale and military effectiveness and\\r\\ncohesiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Editorial Board categorically condemnns the defeat of this bill. In particular, the fact that one of our own senators voted against it should bring shame to our state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis defeat underscores the underlying issues surrounding our male-dominated military and government. And while the armed forces ought to be respected, the safety of our women and men in uniform shouldn’t come second to the cult of worship of our military.\\r\\n\\r\\nSexual assault is a major problem in the military. Our elected officials, on both sides of the aisle, seem too willing to turn a blind eye in favor of pretending our citizens in uniform are infallible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe argument that the bill by Gillibrand would damage the morale of the military is absurd. We don’t buy into the argument that allowing military lawyers to control military conduct cases is damaging to morale.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat damages military morale is fearing that your commanding officer could rape you and never face trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur lawmakers need to shed this “boys will be boys” attitude when it comes to sexual assault. It isn’t a male\\r\\n\\r\\ntendency to rape people. That’s a savage, destructive, inhumane tendency.\\r\\nLawmakers across the country, such as Coats, are perpetuating and advancing the existing rape culture in the U.S. Lawmakers like Coats are more than willing to forego the safety of women in exchange for pandering under the guise of being patriotic.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatriotism is not turning a blind eye to the problems that we face as a nation. Patriotism is standing up and working to fix those problems.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoats and his 44 friends in the Senate are not patriots. They bring shame upon the Senate, military and U.S. as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen women and men are sexually assaulted by commanding officers and infantrymen alike, we need a change. We applaud Gillibrand’s truly patriotic efforts to try and make the military safer.\\r\\n\\r\\nGod knows they shouldn’t fear their fellow soldiers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xadopinion@idsnews.com\\r\\n@ids_opinion.',\n",

       "  'body': 'An expanded Lifeline Law will soon grant Hoosiers increased immunities when they call 911 under the influence of alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legislation, which passed the Indiana Senate and House of Representatives without opposition, builds on existing protections to grant immunity from prosecution for underage individuals who report medical emergencies or crimes they witness. The current Lifeline Law only applies to medical emergencies caused by alcohol consumption.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It expands your protections if you’ve been using alcohol or drugs and you’re reporting a medical emergency, or you’re the victim of a sexual assault or you’ve witnessed a crime and you’re reporting that crime,” Sen. Mark Stoops, D-Bloomington, said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the process of creating the Lifeline Law in 2012 and expanding it this legislative session, student representatives from universities around the state have been heavily involved. Members of the IU Student Association helped draft the original language and testified at the Statehouse about the expansion.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the ideas in the expansion came from IUSA and other student government organizations in the state, said Sen. Jim Merritt, R-Indianapolis, the bill’s author.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They painted a picture, accurately so, about sexual assault going unreported because an individual was drunk,” Merritt said. “Expanding it so that if you’re a victim of a crime or you witness a crime that you’re given immunity as well, and that’s primarily from the students themselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to introducing new situations in which underage drinkers will be immune from prosecution, the Lifeline Law expansion establishes a “mitigating circumstance” for individuals who call 911 for medical emergencies while under the influence of illegal drugs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mitigating circumstance would give police and prosecutors the option not to arrest or file charges if the 911 call were the only reason a person using drugs was caught.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s not full-blown immunity, but it allows police or prosecutors to waive any charge related to that,” Stoops said. “That’s important.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said there is a problem of sexual assaults and some other crimes going unreported in Monroe County, and he hopes this expansion will help the county prosecutor.\\r\\n\\r\\nStoops filed a bill this session that would have granted immunity to 911 callers under the influence of drugs and controlled substances. It was absorbed into Merritt’s bill during the session.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My original language proposed immunity,” Stoops said. “As far as I’m concerned, we don’t want any barriers for somebody reporting an emergency situation. It’s certainly more important that we’re finding out if somebody’s overdosed or somebody’s the victim of a crime than having to place more importance on the fact that somebody might be abusing drugs.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Merritt said his goal is to ensure people, and especially students, understand the immunities and mitigating circumstances granted by the Lifeline Law. He will visit college campuses with Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller and speak at freshman orientation programs.\\r\\n\\r\\nMerritt and other legislators have collaborated with retailers around the state, including Big Red Liquors, to better communicate about the Lifeline Law’s provisions when people purchase handles of hard liquor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s my responsibility to continue to educate the masses of kids who go to Indiana colleges,” Merritt said. “A lot of times that’s where our problems lie — is kids who have newfound freedom.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Lifeline Law expansion does not include the full immunity accounted for in Stoops’s bill, he said he was pleased with the bipartisan nature of the law. Not only was the expansion unanimous in both the Indiana House and Senate, but the passage of the original law was, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We do have bipartisan efforts on a lot of bills that both Democrats and Republicans feel strongly about,” he said. “The Lifeline bill really reflects shared concerns.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Michael Auslen on Twitter @MichaelAuslen.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A program called “the Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault” came to IU to talk to fraternity brothers about sexual assault prevention.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that’s the bee’s knees.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore programs like this need to happen at IU, especially when it seems that every other week there’s a new report of sexual assault or rape in Bloomington. Moreover, what I really appreciated was the program seems geared specifically toward men and what men need to know and hear about rape and assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat’s an area that’s severely lacking in assault discourses.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of the discussion about rape culture centers around the victims — usually\\r\\nwomen. This is not to say these discourses and discussions are not important. Clearly the victim’s struggle must be appreciated and fully understood — and to a certain extent the victim is more relatable.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a lot, however, is said about a man’s part to play in all this.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say “man” here because the program was based on teaching men about what they can do to prevent assault. Men, it seems, are given a blasé and vague set of guidelines about how maybe they can maybe not rape people. Not many are fully versed at all in the different forms sexual assault can take. In fact, not many people in general can clearly recognize a rape, or know how to deal with assault — yours truly included.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt’s from this basic ignorance that rape culture stems, and it means this program, and others like it, are extremely important.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt allows men to voice their opinions, to ask questions without fear of judgment or prejudice and to learn in an environment that will not automatically condemn them for their lack of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was also discussed how quickly fraternities gain a “rape frat” reputation, and what that means for the brothers who have pledged there.There is the insecurity of a job, the social stigma and, bluntly, the idea that the brother himself could be a rapist.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program directors also said when a rape is reported, 70 percent of the time the woman was drunk and 80 percent of the time the man was drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot under the influence of any other drugs, but purely alcohol. They warned the drinking culture at IU practically lends itself to dangerous situations, which should make us stop and think.\\r\\n \\r\\nBut it’s through programs like this that we can really enact change.

Seventy percent of women and 80 percent of men had been drinking when a sexual assault occurred.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men reminded the attendees of the negative consequences that result from rape accusations, like social probation, questions from potential employers and media\\r\\nattention.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t want to wear those letters on your chest and have people look at you and say you’re part of the ‘rape frat,’” Weber said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe program included an activity in which Houlemarde asked the men to stand when he mentioned something they agreed with or had experienced.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf of the room stood when asked if they know a victim of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one person stood when asked if they had heard one of their brothers suggesting using alcohol as a means of hooking up with a girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nHoulemarde said it was likely not everyone in the room was telling the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Men are not going to feel comfortable talking about that stuff in a room with people they don’t know,” he said. “In smaller groups the conversations are a little different. I can understand why there might be some hesitance, but it’s really positive to get so much representation from the different houses.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHoulemarde also discussed the difficulty of measuring progress made by spreading awareness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When it comes to issues of sexual assault the more awareness we raise, we won’t necessarily see a decrease in numbers,” he said. “If we get more awareness out there more people feel comfortable reporting incidents of sexual assaults so it’s hard to perceive progress. We want people to feel more comfortable reporting this but we also want people to stop committing these crimes in the first place.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWeber ended the presentation by reminding brothers of the importance of simply talking about sexual assault issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re not saying you’re going to go home tonight and totally eliminate sexual assault tomorrow,” Weber said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re trying to get you guys started talking about these difficult topics.

       "  'body': 'Hold down the fort. Batten down the hatches. Prepare the cannons, because moms in America have declared war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe targets are an unlikely bunch — Girl Scouts. The young, green-vested cookie peddlers have recently come under fire for their alleged support of abortion activists and sex education. Though representatives from Girl Scouts of America have apologized and maintained a staunchly apolitical position, several pro-life groups are continuing to call for a nationwide boycott of buying Girl Scout cookies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this grudge isn’t new. Nay, the wound runs deep. A battle against Girl Scouts has waged for nearly ten years, ever since one fateful day in 2004 when a local branch in Waco, Texas, began supporting a summer sex-ed seminar, Nobody’s Fool.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeemed “pornographic” and an “assault on Christian morality,” the program ignited a hostile reaction from mothers in the area who, in turn, banded together with local politician and pro-life activist John Pisciotta. Together, they formed a group that sought to bring Girl Scouts’ alleged morality crimes into the public spotlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second strike occurred when the same branch decided to honor a Planned Parenthood manager as a “Woman of Distinction” for her outstanding service to the\\r\\ncommunity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final and most recent straw, oddly enough, was neither a problematic accolade nor a questionable sponsorship, but two seemingly innocuous posts on social media. The\\r\\nofficial Girl Scouts of America Twitter merely retweeted a link from the Huffington Post listing the top influential women of the year, which happened to contain an image of women’s health activist Sen. Wendy Davis.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day later, they made a similarly fateful mistake on Facebook — another prefabricated list of influential women containing United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius sparked outrage within a small community of pro-lifers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the Editorial Board recognizes the importance of maintaining a “family friendly” environment in groups focused toward young people, we believe CookieCott 2014 and those behind it are deeply misguided in their decision to push their agenda onto an organization that has already publicly apologized and denied involvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough one could argue that Girl Scouts’ most recent moves were calculated choices that convey some degree of support for hot topics, we believe their refusal to wholly and publicly embrace conservatism is the most distressing issue for these fringe groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nGirl Scouts is based on the premise of creating an atmosphere in which girls can feel confident and exhibit strength in whatever path they choose.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy pandering to a small fraction of dissatisfied extremists, this honorable institution would be going against all the values it instills.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese boycotters are focused solely on a non-issue, while ignoring the incredible things Girl Scouts does for communities and young women. They are one of the main advocates of women in STEM careers, creating after-school programs with FIRST Robotics to get girls interested in the sciences.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, they have a long history of partnership with NASA, which has introduced many young women to the male-dominated field of astrophysics.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, and most ironically, this boycott succeeds in doing what it is actively trying to prevent — bringing “adult issues” into a kid-oriented environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy taking something as inoffensive as the annual Girl Scout cookie sale and politicizing it to fit an anti-abortion, abstinence-only agenda, these mothers and their politician mouthpieces have unwittingly brought the discourse of sexuality and women’s health into their own homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children they are fighting so valiantly to shelter are now faced with tough questions with equally tough answers, possibly at ages not conducive to total understanding.\\r\\nTo those boycotting, we implore you to put down your torches and pitchforks, and pick up a delicious box of Thin Mints.

Or so we’d like to think.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently the IU Student Association seemed to finally do something right.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast week this publication reported that IUSA proposed amendments to the Indiana Lifeline Law on Jan. 22 that expand the language to apply to victims of sexual assault and other crimes, as well as situations involving underage drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Editorial Board genuinely welcomes this legislative push to afford more protection to students, especially those that might be victims of sexual assault while under the influence of alcohol.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, this new push also raises several questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring last year’s election, the other major executive ticket — Hoosiers 4 Solutions — had this very same proposed amendment to the Lifeline Law as one of its central promises in its campaign platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile YOUniversity, the ticket in office now, dismissed efforts to lobby the legislature for this amendment, instead opting for action at the University level, with such pressing issues as bringing handles back to tailgates and the proposed “pub” in the Union — both of which have failed to materialize.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong after the election, Sen. Jim Merritt independently proposed expanding the Lifeline Law to cover medical emergencies around October 2013. Missing, however, was any mention of coverage for victims of sexual assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time the original architect of the Hoosiers 4 Solutions platform contacted Merritt’s office to suggest the inclusion of the amendment in his proposed legislation, which the senator seemingly acted upon and had included by Jan. 12. \\r\\n\\r\\nIUSA contacted Merritt about the issue back in March despite deeming it a waste of the time during the election season. IUSA, however, did not officially introduce the amendments to the Lifeline Law until Jan. 22, after the amendment was already included in the proposed legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough we celebrate the additions to the Lifeline as a significant and overdue step in increasing student safety on our campus, the Editorial Board cannot overlook this last minute change of heart by IUSA at a time when it has accomplished so little and its time in office rapidly continues to dwindle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs tuition payers, we must keep our student government accountable and demand results. We currently pay IUSA’s top executives $3,000 each in salaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost importantly, if we’re paying student leaders such a substantial amount of Student Fee funds, we should expect ideas and proposals from those elected — not from the defeated ticket that offered to enact those same proposals at no cost to the student body.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— opinion@idsnews.com\\r\\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter @ids_opinion.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Dylan Farrow, Mia Farrow’s daughter, has recently released an open letter in The New York Times that confirms old accusations that Woody Allen sexually assaulted her as a child. Her letter is brave, heartbreaking and completely correct in her condemnation, not only of Woody Allen for his abuse but also of the society that would willing turn a blind eye to protect a favorite.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people’s first response to this discovery could be to doubt what she is saying. Woody Allen is a beloved film director and cemented pop culture icon. When you hear about such awful acts coming from such an admired person, the first response is often backlash.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is, of course, insulting to rape and abuse victims everywhere. Our society has always been overly eager to assume that the victim is lying or that it is somehow his or her fault, and this is one of the biggest reasons that so many acts of sexual violence go unreported. Our first response to news like this should always be support and understanding toward the victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe added complication of this particular case is the emotional connection Allen’s fans feel not only to his movies but also to him.\\r\\nI struggled with my own attachment to his work when I heard the news. After all, it isn’t as if his movies are suddenly bad. Once you have accepted art into your life and into your heart, there is a certain ownership that is hard to let go.\\r\\nI felt conflicted as to whether it was right for me to still appreciate his movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is until I actually read Dylan Farrow’s open letter. Her story was pointed and heartbreaking. When I finished reading it, I actually felt nauseated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at this point that I realized how selfish my reaction to her confession had been. The fact that Annie Hall is forever tainted now is hardly the biggest tragedy of this story. A young girl was sexually and emotionally abused, and she was made to feel, by an entire industry and fan base, that her struggle was less important than a slew of popular movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only excuse I can see for this is that people don’t want to condemn stories they love. This philosophy, however, is making a tragedy about you, the viewer, when it could not be less about you.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real victim here is a 7-year-old girl who was abused by a trusted father figure and pressured to keep silent for 21 years as the rest of the world worshiped her abuser.\\r\\nWe were wrong to ignore it in the past — not just with Woody Allen but also with every public figure guilty of crimes that have other men rotting in prison without a thought of forgiveness. We would be even worse to ignore it again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing the public can do now is to do as Farrow asks: acknowledge her struggle, adjust our idols and be more receptive in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— jordile@indiana.edu\\r\\nFollow columnist\\r\\nJordan Riley on Twitter\\r\\n@RiledUpIDS.',\n",

While we may never have answers for the tragedies that cause\\r\\nimmense grief for families and communities, we do know that barriers to reporting still exist.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMitjavila said this law would particularly benefit IU because of its prominent underage drinking culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have a large population of students who are under the age of 21 and partake in drinking at parties,” Mitjavila said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Lifeline Law, which passed during the 2012 Indiana General Assembly legislative session, provides immunity for public intoxication, minor possession, minor consumption and minor transport to people who sought medical assistance for a person suffering from an alcohol-related health emergency.  \\r\\n“The goal is not to condone underage drinking but to acknowledge that mistakes are made — mistakes which should not cost the life of a young Hoosier,” Kauffman and Mitjavila wrote in a letter to the executives of other student governments in the state, urging them to support this motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter its approval, a clause was added to make it effective immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill will go to the full Senate to be voted on in late February or early March. If approved, it will immediately take effect, Mitjavila said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“With more encompassing language and added protection to both the caller and victim, we hope to see increases in reporting,” Mitjavila said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Dani Castonzo on Twitter @Dani_Castonzo.',\n",

We expect them, additionally, to legislate effectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, our representatives and senators in Indianapolis aren’t being effective. Nor do they even seem to be in touch with what Indiana residents need from their government.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur legislature is instead so lethargic and so self-involved that they’ve seemingly decided that their job doesn’t affect those of us who put them into office in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndiana and her residents face a myriad of problems and challenges every single day.\\r\\n\\r\\nProblems such as how Indiana education has been continually falling in national rankings since 2010. We’re continually one of the least healthy states, with some of the highest rates of obesity, smoking, diabetes and lack of child immunizations.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the state legislature would be interested to know that, according to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Assault Committee, one in five women in Indiana have been raped. Maybe the fiscal conservatives would like to know that Indiana is one of the worst states for entrepreneurs, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery two years, the Indiana Legislature is in session for only 91 scheduled days, with 61 of those days being dedicated to the state budget and the remaining 30 in short session years.\\r\\n\\r\\nLogically, and perhaps a bit naively, we’d like to think our government would, in this short amount of time, be passing meaningful education reform, effective health programs, sexual assault prevention strategies or fiscal stimulus for small business owners.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd of course, we’d be wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, the Indiana Statehouse has been busy tackling issues they feel are much more important then educating our children or preventing rape.\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse Joint Resolution 3, the constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in Indiana, has taken up a large amount of time in the statehouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSen. Jean Leising R-Oldenburg has decided that cursive is so important to Indiana education that she’s proposed the same law — which mandates cursive be taught in all Indiana schools — for the third year in a row.\\r\\n\\r\\nState Rep.

The bill died in committee within a few days of proposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sick of our Indiana Legislature mirroring the U.S. Congress. Our legislature has a only short amount of time to make a positive change in the lives of Hoosiers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd regardless of your opinion on gay marriage, cursive or guns on college campuses, they won’t solve our problems. The news is always reporting on big bills meant to solve issues about energy, education, healthcare or drug-reform in other states.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Indiana only gets in the news for moving backwards and wasting time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe deserve better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— ajguenth@indiana.edu\\r\\nFollow columnist\\r\\nAndrew Guenther on Twitter @GuentherAndrew.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Greek life at IU generally draws two opinions from the student population — you love it, or you hate it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith men’s spring recruitment kicking off today, those viewpoints are likely to be cemented once the process concludes for greek hopefuls.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 5,000 students are involved in 65 different greek-related organizations. It’s pretty unavoidable around campus.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost students form an opinion on the system one way or another, and usually the viewpoints are pretty black and white. If you’re in it, you support it. If you’re not, well, you don’t.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe non-greek population on campus has less than positive things to say about fraternities in particular.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there are many instances in which judgments are made off of cold hard facts and personal experiences, many of the stories spread about the greek system can be pinned to a small percentage of fraternities and sororities, making the criticism a blanket judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, fraternities get a bad rap for supporting an “eat, sleep, drink” lifestyle. But it’s also important to keep in mind IU’s greek system presents more than that.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents involved in a fraternity or sorority consistently earn higher GPAs than non-greek undergraduate students. In 2011, the average sorority and fraternity GPA was a 3.2, compared to a non-greek undergraduate average GPA of a 3.1.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to scholarship, the greek system at IU focuses on involvement in philanthropy and volunteer work. Thousands of dollars are raised annually by the sororities and fraternities on IU’s campus to support charitable causes. Zeta Tau Alpha in particular raises almost $200,000 each year for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis isn’t a sales pitch. It’s an honest evaluation of what is commonly overlooked when analyzing fraternities.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, while fraternities do plenty of good, some also display severe issues in their culture that can’t be overlooked by how much money is raised at IU’s Dance Marathon.\\r\\n\\r\\nHazing, cultural insensitivity, increased risk of sexual assault, sexism, a tacit belligerence toward progressive ideology, homophobia and a childish contempt for the larger non-greek population are all reasons many have a negative view of fraternities, even if it’s just a small pool that actually has a hand in this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough some may say it is questionable to use any sort of all-encompassing criticism of greek life — since so much varies from chapter to chapter — the fact is that these things do happen in at least one chapter on our campus. And one chapter is one too much.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the greek system itself can’t or won’t keep them accountable, we will.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecoming a part of greek life is a personal choice, and deciding either way isn’t right or wrong. But being greek is a privilege, not a right. Any group that hampers progress on our campus will continue to hear from the Editorial Board.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, we must keep in mind that even though there are unpleasant frat boys and rude sorority girls, there are also unpleasant and rude people across campus who don’t wear greek letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost importantly, there are fraternities and sororities that are actively leading the way in making the greek system a safer and more inclusive space. And they should know they have the Editorial Board’s unilateral and continuing support in doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— opinion@idsnews.com\\r\\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter @ids_opinion.',\n",

The office will draw from interviews, police reports, medical evidence, social media and more to investigate a particular case, which will be heard within 60 days.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Office of Student Ethics selects its hearing panels for sexual assault cases from a pool of about 20 people who have received more than 40 hours of training, Casares said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Department of Education released its Dear Colleague letter in spring 2011, the Office of Student Ethics began making sexual assault hearing decisions on a preponderance of evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means the plaintiff in a civil case must provide just enough evidence to prove a claim, as opposed to the previous standard of clear and convincing evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was a huge game changer, and we immediately adjusted,” Casaras said. “It’s literally 50.0001 percent more likely than not.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is much more difficult to prove guilt in a criminal case.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike student ethics cases, complainants in criminal cases must prove their standard of evidence beyond reasonable doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nDebbie Melloan, a sexual assault counselor at SACS, said she often helps inform victims of their options when dealing with sexual assault cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would let that person decide which body they want to report to,” Melloan said. “One of my roles is to empower that person and let them make their own choices.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Office of Student Ethics receives all cases from the IU Police Department. It does not receive all reports from off-campus agencies, such as the Middle Way House, the Monroe County Prosecutor’s Office, the IU Health Bloomington hospital and the Bloomington Police Department, unless those students report the event directly to the University. \\r\\n\\r\\n“We are trying to improve that,” Casares said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasares said his office meets every two months with a Sexual Assault Service Providers Network to share sexual assault information and statistics with its off-campus partners in order to collect accurate data for the annual Clery Report.\\r\\n\\r\\nMelloan said she feels IU and the nation should improve sexual assault prevention by encouraging victims to report cases as they occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Historically, there’s been a lot of myths associated with sexual assault and biases that make it hard for victims to come forward,” Melloan said. “Anything we can do to keep it at the forefront of national attention is going to be at the benefit of everybody.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCasares said the White House Task Force is a step in the right direction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It immediately places an issue like sexual assault at the top of everybody’s radar,” Casares said. “But it’s already been on our radar.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFollow reporter Samantha Schimdt on Twitter @schmidtsam7.',\n",

       "  'body': 'President Barack Obama announced he has shifted his sexual assault-preventative attention from the U.S. military to our college campuses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the wake of a White House council report that revealed about 22 million women in the United States, or about 20 percent, have been raped in their lifetimes, Obama gave a task force three months to develop a plan of action to both reduce the number of sexual assaults on college campuses and increase awareness about the growing problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I applaud the president for seeking a solution, I found it ironic that presumptuous sexism underlined his charge to combat a crime widely viewed as solely a women’s issue:\\r\\n\\r\\n“We can do more to make sure that every young man out there, whether they’re in junior high or high school or college or beyond, understand what’s expected of them and what it means to be a man and to intervene if they see somebody else acting inappropriately,” Obama said.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps before we communicate those expectations to “every young man out there,” it would be helpful for the president to delineate exactly what those expectations are, and what precisely he thinks it means to “be a man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRather than fighting an erroneously gendered issue with an erroneously gendered mindset, President Obama needs to task officials with raising awareness about the ramifications of rape throughout all of society, not just among women.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study done by the Center for Disease Control found that one in 21 men, or 4.8 percent, reported that they had been forced to engage in intercourse.  This study did not include men in prison.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, Human Rights Watch estimated that at least 140,000 inmates had been raped while incarcerated. Although that statistic includes male, female and transgender prisoners, the perpetrator and victim are almost always the same sex due to the gender-segregated nature of incarceration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expectation Obama implied — that “every young man” should “intervene if they see somebody else acting inappropriately” — is frankly ridiculous and offensive in its assumption that every assaulter is a young man and it is therefore their duty to prevent assaults.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a global issue. Sexual violence is one of the most prevalent and least-reported crimes in our society today, and a monster of this magnitude finds both blame and resolution in everyone, not just college boys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not a question of “being a man,” but being a human. Rape affects everyone, and by accrediting a massive problem to a small slice of the community, Obama and those who employ similar rhetoric are perpetuating the power-dynamic psychology that leads to most forms of violence and victimization in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nI appreciate the president’s intentions, but the ends do not justify the means. Declaring to young men that they are failing to fulfill society’s “expectations” and must “be men” is precisely the wrong way to end violence between genders, among genders and throughout the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmpowerment is indeed the name of the game, Obama, so empower everyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xad— sbkissel@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'By Taylor Telfordttelford@indiana.edu | @ttelford1883INDIANAPOLIS — The former head of the Jared Fogle Foundation was sentenced to 27 years in prison Thursday.Russell Taylor, 44, pleaded guilty to 12 counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and one count of creation and distribution of child pornography.Judge Tanya Walton Pratt gave him a moderate sentence — more than the 15 to 23 years suggested by the defense, but substantially lower than the 35 years recommended by the prosecution.“The departure (from the recommended sentence) is based on his assistance of authorities in providing information about Jared Fogle and his lack of a criminal history,” Pratt said when delivering the sentence.Taylor must serve at least 85 percent of the sentence. At minimum, he will be 65 years old when he is released. He will then have a lifetime of supervision to ensure he does not repeat his crimes.Taylor placed cameras throughout his home to capture footage of children bathing, changing and masturbating. Many of the children — as young as 9 and as old as 16 — were Taylor’s relatives. None were aware of the recordings.Taylor asserted the cameras were for security purposes, yet they were placed in bedrooms and bathrooms: near places that were likely to catch people in various states of undress. Taylor does not appear in any of the videos, except brief footage that shows him setting up the cameras.Two of the victims said they had oral sex with Taylor when they were younger than 16 and that afterward Taylor drove them to a truck stop and withdrew money from an ATM to pay them. A search of Taylor’s home revealed commercial pornography of 6-year-olds, both boys and girls.Despite this, Taylor claimed he has no sexual attraction to children. He said he was motivated by Fogle, who encouraged him to make the recordings. Fogle denies this.“I’ve always been an outcast,” Taylor said, as he stood before the judge. “I met someone who was rich and famous and wanted to be my friend, and as a result I made terrible mistakes.”In a November evaluation, Dr. Robin Kohli, the witness for the defense, said Taylor had a traumatic childhood that contributed to his crimes. Taylor suffered physical abuse at the hands of his mother. When Taylor was young, he was sodomized by a neighbor and the neighbor’s son — his only friend.“These interactions taught him to associate friendship with negative sexual activity, with abuse,” Kohli said. “It’s evident that this played out with Fogle as well.”Fogle and Taylor’s relationship was far from what’s appropriate between employer and employee, said defense attorney Brad Banks. Fogle took Taylor on various trips overseas, to Colts games and commercial shoots in Los Angeles. He owned Taylor’s home and paid his salary. After Taylor’s arrest, when it became clear Taylor was cooperating with authorities, Fogle filed a motion to foreclose Taylor’s home.Still, several signs pointed to Taylor continuing his crimes outside of Fogle’s influence. Although Taylor was in possession of pornography of 12 children, footage of only eight were shared with Fogle.Text messages from January of this year between Taylor and the 17-year-old boyfriend of one victim showed that Taylor tried to “groom” some children for sexual activity — inviting them to parties and often providing them with marijuana, alcohol and ecstasy. In the texts, Taylor tried to convince the boy to bring the victim, who was 14 at the time, to a sex party at his house.“We normally never party with people under 16,” Taylor said in one message, “But sometimes people end up naked and playing games and you never know what’s gonna happen.”The sheer number and duration of Taylor’s offenses are most telling of his character, despite his claims of childhood trauma and Fogle’s influence, said senior litigation counsel Steven DeBrota.“It’s a sobering thing. There are 12 victims, 12 individualized decisions to collect child porn,” DeBrota said. “These all required him to be calculating, patient, manipulative and motivated.”Taylor attempted to hang himself while being held in Marion County Jail in May, after he suffered physical assaults at the hands of other prisoners. Since then, he has been held in a facility in Kentucky. Now, he will be taken to a prison in Marianna, Florida. The defense requested that Taylor go there to be treated for his sexual and mental disorders and also be closer to his father, who lives in the state and wishes to visit him.Taylor — handcuffed and unshaven in a green prison jumpsuit — wept as he addressed the courtroom. He spoke of how haunted he has been by his actions and said he has gone to sleep in “a puddle of tears” every night since his arrest.“I promise you’ve never had a person more remorseful than I am,” Taylor told the judge.Pratt acknowledged Taylor’s remorse, his vital role in Fogle’s incarceration, his mental instability and his traumatic childhood. However, she said the latter should have been the greatest deterrent from his actions.“Taylor knew first-hand the scars of such abuse, yet the harm to his victims is immense,” Pratt said. “The awful reality is that he knew right from wrong, and he preyed upon those he should have loved and cared about.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The cultural stigma surrounding rape and conversations about rape are widespread.But what about rape that occurs in the porn industry?When well-known porn star Stoya accused fellow porn performer and former boyfriend James Deen of rape on Twitter, fans, reporters and critics were sent reeling.That thing where you log in to the internet for a second and see people idolizing the guy who raped you as a feminist. That thing sucks.I want to assure my friends, fans and colleagues that these allegations are both false and defamatoryJames Deen is a high-profile porn star who has been lauded for his relatable hipster appearance and his attention to the pleasure of his female co-stars.Deen has also been described by the Guardian as “the porn star even a feminist could like” by female critics.We would like to point out describing Deen as “a porn star feminists could like” or labeling Deen as a feminist is problematic. The porn industry as a whole is notorious for misogynistic practices.Deen’s acclaim seems to mostly come from his previous reputation of being attentive to his female co-stars.Being unselfish during sex hardly qualifies someone as a feminist.However, the title is especially inappropriate considering Deen has insisted he is not a feminist, according to the Guardian.The Editorial Board condemns any act of violence and believes consent is mandatory for all sexual acts, especially sexual acts that are done professionally.Being a participant of the porn industry, or a sex worker of any kind, is not an open invitation for unwanted sexual advances.Stoya claims the rape she suffered took place outside a professional porn setting and occurred while she and Deen were dating.Since coming out with allegations against Deen, eight other female porn performers have corroborated Stoya’s story with other stories of abuse by Deen in a professional setting.Many female performers have Deen on their “no” list of people they do not want to do scenes with because of his reputation in the industry as liking “to break women,” as performer Leathers told the Guardian.Many critics and anti-porn advocates argue the outpouring of rape accusations from other performers leads them to believe these subsequent accusations are false.Well, identifying your rapist on a public platform, especially when you are famous, is incredibly difficult and puts your career at risk. If one person speaks about a rape, it is easier for others to speak out as well.The rape allegations against Deen bring up important issues about how the porn industry and its performers are viewed by society.Porn performers are often viewed as not being subject to sexual assault with the distinction between porn and rape being hard to define.The Editorial Board believes the distinction between porn and rape should be consent.There is no reason for any person to fear being raped or sexually assaulted by co-workers while they are at work or at home with a romantic partner.The idea that a person working as a sex performer automatically consents to all sexual acts is a myth. Just because a person participates in sex acts as a profession does not mean he or she desires to be sexual with all people at all times.Porn stars deserve the same rights to autonomy and protection just as any other human being does.Rape is rape, no matter what.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Department of Defense, usually the last one to hop on the train of progress, has finally made a much needed step toward equality for women in the armed forces by finally opening combat roles to women.From now on, any role in the military is open to any person, regardless of gender, who qualifies.This decision, announced by Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter on Dec. 3, puts to rest outdated and misogynistic ideas that women (who pass the same physical and mental requirements as their male counterparts, according the Carter) are inferior in combat.Women have already been serving in combat zones under fire, but without official combat titles and positions, according to the New York Times.This restriction didn’t keep women out of combat, but it did keep them from advancing in the military due to lack of official combat experience on their records.While this is a huge step for the equality and recognition of women in the armed forces, we here on the Editorial Board have to recognize the legitimate concerns of encouraging even more women to join the armed forces.According to the U.S. Department of Labor, a range of 20 percent to 48 percent of women in the military are reported as experiencing military sexual assault, which is a startling number, even when compared to the national average of one in six women being sexually assaulted in their lifetime. Eighty percent of women in the military reported experiencing sexual harassment.On top of these reported figures, CNN reported in 2013 that “victims are often pressured to remain quiet or endure having their reputations and careers tarnished for coming forward.”This culture of coerced silence is just starting to be addressed, with the addition of special victims units within the military and specialized training to identify and eradicate sexual misconduct, according to CNN.However, these measures are only successful if the people running them aren’t also misled by the conqueror/conquest mindset of some in the military that so easily lends itself to rape. Even with these new departments in place, it’s unclear how much safer victims of sexual assault, both male and female, really are.Due to the nature of the work in the military, victims are often stuck in the same physical space as their attacker, whether it be a submarine or the front lines.What is the protocol for reporting an attack that takes place during an operation?The real solution would be to change the culture of the military away from encouraging aggression, regardless of whether it’s toward your own comrades, and away from victim blaming.Opening combat roles to women in the military is a fantastic step — it’s the best news we’ve heard since the armed forces officially allowed gay men and women to enroll in 2011.But we can’t pretend that it was just the bogus restrictions that hold women back. For a long time, the armed forces has paraded itself as a boys club and it’s going to take a while before that belief and mentality among those in it dissipates.The military offers a lot of good opportunities and it’s only fair that women have an equal shot to better themselves through the education and training that the military provides.We don’t want to cut anyone short here.However, it’s not fair that in order to accept these opportunities, recruits put themselves at great risk of sexual assault and harassment from the men in their units.Women in the military have won this battle for equality, but the war isn’t over yet.',\n",

       "  'body': 'At 5:10 p.m., a gunman with a mini-14 rifle in hand and a hunting knife on his person entered a classroom at École Polytechnique in Montréal that was occupied by about 60 engineering students.He ordered the women to the back of the room and for the men to leave.When the students didn’t comply with his orders, he fired warning shots into the ceiling. The men left, fearing for their lives and leaving the women with the gunman.The gunman asked the nine women in front of him if they knew why he was cornering them. One woman, Nathalie Provost, responded, “no.”“I am fighting feminism,” he said in French.”We are not feminists,” Provost said. “I have never fought against men.” But it was too late. The gunman began to open fire on the women.“You’re all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.”With the most recent mass shootings and the rise of men who feel exposed by the feminist movement, this account might sound like something you’d hear about on the evening news. But this shooting is more than a quarter of a century old.Sunday marked the 25th anniversary of the École Polytechnique massacre, a shooting that left 14 women dead, a majority of them engineering students, because — according to the gunman — they were feminists and feminism had ruined his life.Twitter welcomed the hashtag #Rememberthe14 Sunday to honor the young women who’d lost their lives and those like Provost, who had survived, inside an institute of learning where most of them were pursuing a career in a field dominated by men.But as we remember these women, we forget how similar their fate is for women today.This brutal killing is parallel to several gendered mass shootings we’ve seen recently.The shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a few weeks ago seems to be an intentional attack on reproductive rights after the gunman muttered “no more baby parts” to law enforcement.A gunman killed six people last year in Isla Vista, California, because “girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to (him),” according to his own manifesto he posted on YouTube moments before the shooting.Women have enough reasons to fear men, such as high rates of sexual assault, stalking and violence from an intimate partner, but we’ve been lying to ourselves if we believe this is an issue of individual safety. Gendered violence and misogyny can even be the motivation of a mass shooting.But this never seems to be the topic of discussion when a shooting like the École Polytechnique massacre occurs.News outlets bring up theories about mental illness and “beta-male mentality” that eventually create a vicious argument about restricting guns or managing those who are mentally ill better.We never strictly address how often men kill women — as individuals and in groups — because they are women.If you think this problem is a theory conducted by a femi-nazi who is using “rare” incidents to punish men, I ask you this: When is the last time you can remember a female shooter gunning down men specifically or citing men as the reason for their mass killing?According to the FBI, of the 160 active shooter incidents between 2001 and 2013 in the U.S., only 6 involved female shooters.The most recent female shooter of the San Bernardino terrorist attack was a jihadist, and it seems her targets weren’t specified by gender.Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group against gun violence that gained traction after the Sandy Hook shootings, conducted an analysis of mass shootings from January 2009 to July 2015 and found while “15 percent of total gun homicide victims in the U.S. between 2008-12 were female, 50 percent of the victims of mass shootings in this analysis were female.”Men, not just women, should be concerned about these numbers, not only because we all should be fighting gendered violence but because men are not always spared in these attacks, and men are usually the shooters.Feminism isn’t ruining men’s lives — the patriarchy ruins lives, and those who feel threatened by the dismantling of it probably benefit from the power scheme.Feminism isn’t causing the deaths of women in these mass shootings, and feminism isn’t the reason for gendered violence — men are.maehogan@indiana.edu@madisonhogan',\n",

       "  'body': 'The alleged Nov. 17 assault in which a man forced his way into a young woman’s apartment and sexually assaulted her at gunpoint did not, as it turns out, actually happen, according to the Indiana Daily Student.During the course of the Bloomington Police Department’s investigation of the alleged incident, the woman admitted she had known the man and that he had not, in fact, assaulted her. The man in question claimed there had been a monetary dispute between the two of them and said he believes the woman’s allegations were an attempt to retaliate against him.While it is still unclear exactly what happened that night, this Editorial Board unanimously decries false accusations of sexual assault, which is what this young woman’s original account seems to be.Keeping in mind it is not at all uncommon for rape victims to be pressured into recanting allegations of sexual assault that actually did occur, we do not want to claim to know what really happened. We don’t know if a rape took place or not.But we think it is important to begin to have a conversation about false rape accusations and how they hurt literally everyone.The most obvious victim is of course the falsely accused. While legal punishment for rape remains astonishingly rare — an analysis by the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network found that only 2 percent of rapists ever spend a day in jail — being accused of rape is no small matter and can have profound and real consequences for the accused.Another group that suffers when false accusations of rape are made is the not-insignificant number of survivors of rape and sexual assault, many of whom never reported the attacks. These survivors often experience victim-blaming or are even accused of lying when they do come forward. Claiming to have been assaulted when you were not is a huge slap in the face to all survivors.Not only is it enormously disrespectful, claiming rape when there was none can add to the already tremendous amount of skepticism with which survivors’ stories are often approached. Particularly when the accused rapist is popular, powerful or well liked, a survivor might see people flock to her or his rapist’s defense.Even women who have never been sexually assaulted lose when false allegations of rape are made. Many so-called “men’s rights advocates” insist that the phenomenon of false accusations is much more prevalent than is commonly believed. Blogs like “Community of the Wrongly Accused,” suggest that rape is a “handy excuse” women can use to escape the consequences of their illicit sexual encounters. Each and every actual case of false allegations of rape plays into this dangerous narrative of women as vindictive liars hell-bent on destroying men’s lives.Anyone who falsely accuses another person of rape — and this Editorial Board does not claim to know whether the woman who reported the Nov. 17 incident is or is not engaging in this — clearly does not understand the full weight of their actions.Whether what occurred that night was rape or just a dispute over money, the fear that many women feel at IU and in Bloomington — not to mention everywhere else — is well founded and very real. Women really do get raped, and the fear of rape and sexual assault leads women to engage in a variety of defensive and pre-emptive tactics to try to protect themselves.We say that rape is a serious crime that should be taken seriously, and part of taking it seriously is to not claim that a rape occurred unless it actually did.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Members of the Graduate and Professional Student Government passed five bills at their final meeting of the semester Friday, Dec. 4.The first bill passed at the meeting addressed liability and sanctions with regard to sexual misconduct.The resolution asks that IU have mandatory orientation for graduate students functioning as teaching assistants, associate instructors or in other “responsible employee” roles.“Responsible employees” are required to report incidents that fall under Title IX.The orientation would be intended to help these students understand resources for victims of sexual misconduct and the mandatory reporting policies.“Many graduate students, particularly those who teach classes, are obligated to report any incidence of sexual assault they’re aware of to the University,” said Skyler Hutto, vice president of GPSG and chair of the health and wellness committee. “They’re not always aware of those duties, and even if they are, graduate students may not know how best to follow through on those.”The bill also asks for IU to publish its policy on intervention regarding intradepartmental sexual misconduct and to target graduate students with bystander intervention training.Another resolution resolved for improved alerts about crime relevant to campus, with more details. Because some GPSG members feel current safety tips place the impetus of preventing crime on potential victims, the resolution also asks for the provision of different tips.“From here on out, we’re hoping that the safety tips are not so much victim-blaming,” Brittany Witherspoon, diversity officer, said.GPSG also drafted a suggested format for the crime alerts, and asked for consistent inclusion of a suspect’s height, weight, race and other criteria as well as the specific denotation.“This is helpful for us in making sure we’re getting all the information we can, and we don’t end up seeing race in some crime alerts, and then race not discussed in another,” said Shadia Siliman, representative of the gender studies department and contributor to the bill. “That will be really helpful for us in making these more universal, more similar to each other.”This resolution also requests students have more accessibility to the results of campus surveys about sexual misconduct and proposes that IU adopt a “Healthy Sexuality” campaign.Witherspoon said she hopes the actualization of such a campaign would include some kind of task force at the university level.“Healthy sexuality campaigns deal with attacking sexual assault and awareness from a preventative standpoint, and not only from a preventative standpoint, but from a healthy, positive standpoint,” Witherspoon said.A healthy sexuality campaign would promote discussion of consent and discussion of sexuality from an informed, positive point of view, Witherspoon said.Three bills passed Friday came from the health and wellness committee.One resolution asked for the University to investigate increasing on-campus dining options in places frequented by graduate students, such as Ballantine Hall or the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.The resolution also asks that nutritional information for on-campus dining options be more accessible, and that common allergens and main ingredients become more easily identifiable.Another resolution from the health and wellness committee resolved that the University should provide more ergonomic awareness and services to students, as well as more programming related to optometric health.“Eye health commonly deteriorates over the course of one’s graduate school years,” Hutto said.The third and final resolution from the health and wellness committee requested that campus fitness centers somehow be made more accessible to graduate students, and representatives discussed different ways to do this during the meeting.The resolution also asks that fitness facilities be integrated into any new constructions on campus.“What I heard through my committee is that it is not easy to utilize some of the fitness facilities particularly at the hours graduate students would usually keep,” Hutto said.One idea discussed at the meeting was to reserve a specific time for graduate students at campus fitness areas or to allow graduate students access to faculty-only time at the gyms on campus.However, representatives brought up that graduate students pay the student rate for access to fitness facilities through the student activity fee and asking for more privileges for graduate students could cost them more.Hutto said his committee does not seek any specific change, but rather wants the University to find a way to better serve graduates in its fitness facilities.“We want to make sure that graduate students who are paying into (the student activity fee) actually have time to take advantage of something they’re already paying for,” President Benjamin Verdi said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A Bloomington Police Department investigation of an armed sexual assault that allegedly occurred Nov. 17 has concluded the event did not happen as originally reported, according to a BPD press release.The female accuser, 22, reported she heard someone knock on her front door.She told officers that when she opened the door a light-skinned black male unknown to her pushed his way into her apartment and forced her into her bedroom armed with a gun.She reported the suspect sexually assaulted her in the bedroom and then fled the residence.At approximately 3:08 a.m. Nov. 17, BPD officers responded to Brownstone Terrace Apartments located in the 200 block of East 14th Street regarding reports of an armed sexual assault that had just taken place.In a later interview with detectives, a more detailed description was provided, which was used to produce a composite of the suspect.The composite was released to the public through the media in an effort to generate tips.Within a couple of days, a male made contact with the investigating detective and indicated that he might be the individual described in the initial report, according to the release.He informed the detective that he knew the woman and had been with her the night of the reported event, having been invited by her to the residence.He said there had been a dispute about money and was able to provide evidence of text messages before and after his visit that substantiated his claim.The male’s belief was the reported rape was made in retaliation of the monetary dispute and other issues between the two, according to the release.A follow-up interview with the complainant to resolve inconsistencies in her report resulted in an admission that the original version of the story was inaccurate.She admitted to knowing the male who came forward to investigators and that he did not force his way into her residence as reported in the initial report.Overall, the complainant has provided three different accounts of how the incident allegedly occurred.The complainant is also somewhat evasive regarding the reported monetary dispute, according to the release.“Based on the seriousness of the alleged incident, we dedicated extensive resources to fully investigate it,” BPD spokesperson Capt. Joe Qualters said in the release.“The investigation revealed that the incident did not happen as reported, and it is important for us to let the community know in an effort to alleviate the fear and anxiety it caused.”Alyson Malinger',\n",

       "  'body': 'The IU Board of Trustees met Thursday in Alumni Hall at the Indiana Memorial Union.Its agenda included project and design proposals, updates from the Student Welfare Initiative and the Media and Digitization and Preservation Initiative, and a student report.The University Relations Committee’s agenda included mainly reports and updates.Emily Springston, chief of student welfare and Title IX officer, gave an update on the Student Welfare Initiative, an initiative that works to prevent and respond to sexual assault and all forms of sexual misconduct and violence.Springston gave statistics of cases reported last year at each campus. At IU-Bloomington, 252 accounts of sexual misconduct were reported, including 120 sexual assault/contact cases.These reports have increased since last year. This raised questions about why there are more cases even though the initiative was created. Springston said she thinks there is an increased awareness about where and how to report it, not an increase in incidents.“We increase the trust that students have in us,” Springston added.Anne Tinder, president of the IU Student Association, and Ben Verdi, president of the IU Graduate and Professional Student Government, gave a student report that also focused mainly on campus safety.“Students generally don’t feel safe on campus,” Tinder said.Tinder told the trustees some of IUSA’s ideas for increasing campus safety.They included increasing lighting on campus, which is something Tom Morrison, vice president of capital planning and facilities, said his team is working on.“Lighting has been a main priority of ours for many years,” Morrison said.Morrison said they have been changing older lights to LED lights to make them brighter.He said they are working in Dunn’s Woods to improve lighting and safety in that area.Tinder also described programs IUSA is planning on piloting in the spring.These included a partnership with IU Safety Escort and Uber, and a 24-hour call service center that students can call as they are walking home alone.After their reports, the trustees asked questions and discussed ways they can make campus safer.“I think we’re all committed to creating that safe environment,” Michael Mirro, IU trustee, said.Before the University Relations Committee meeting, the Facilities and Auxiliaries Committee met. The committee discussed project and design approvals.Approval was requested for the construction of a facility for the IU Marching Hundred Band. The facility will be 30,000 square feet and located at the corner of Woodlawn Avenue and 17th Street.This location is convenient for the band because it is near the athletic complex and also offers a nice piece of architecture on that corner, Morrison said.“This is definitely something that has been in fundraising for a long time ... definitely a need for a long time,” Morrison said.It will house a 6,000-square-foot rehearsal space, two 2,600-square-foot rehearsal spaces, locker rooms, spaces for instrument storage and repair, a music library and uniform storage.The project is expected to be completed in September 2017 and is estimated to cost $10 million. It will be funded entirely by gifts through the IU Foundation.Morrison and University landscape architect Mia Williams also presented a request for approval for the design of a gateway at Third Street and Indiana Avenue.This will be the fourth of 11 gateways that will be created on the IU-Bloomington campus.Other design approvals included a renovation and addition of the Sigma Nu fraternity house and an addition to the Kelley School of Business for career services.',\n",

Part of discussion centered on possible solutions to changing the culture of campus, as well as practices which could be put in place to make students feel safer.One point made during the meeting was that the information presented in MyStudentBody, an online drug, alcohol and sexual well-being educational program required for freshmen, is not continually emphasized throughout students’ time at IU.Attendees were interested in extending such education throughout the four years most undergraduates are on campus as well as distributing information on drugs, alcohol and sexual well-being that is more specific to IU.The issues of poor lighting off campus and ways to make students walking home feel safer were also discussed. Another idea mentioned was the creation of a hotline for students to call when walking late at night, since many students already call family or friends while walking home as a way to feel safer, IUSA Chief of Staff Sara Zaheer said.The idea for the forum came out of a conversation about a month ago between Zaheer and Sarah Kissel, a junior who worked on the current IUSA administration’s campaign last year. Kissel is a former columnist for the Indiana Daily Student.Zaheer said one day she and Kissel, as well as IUSA Chief of Outreach Rebecca Yeakey, talked about how unsafe they feel in Dunn’s Woods',\n",

David Rhodes, an expert in martial arts, will conduct the seminar from 7:30 to 9 p.m. tonight in the Wildermuth Intramural Center’s gym 169.Rhodes leads similar seminars year-round for both staff and students, teaching both safety and confidence when facing an attacker.Geary said students and faculty have an obligation to look out for each other. She said in this seminar students will be encouraged to try the different defense mechanisms in small groups so they are prepared if they ever face an attack.In a hands-on approach, Rhodes will demonstrate simple techniques, such as how to escape a hold or how to find pressure points to subdue attackers without heavy lifting.“The hardest part about this particular training, this particular seminar, is going to it,” Rhodes said. “Once you get there, you’ll learn, possibly even learn something that you haven’t even had before, and I do try to make them fun.”Rhodes said he tries to keep his seminars simple by teaching tactics that can be modified to each person’s individual comfort zone.“I will just present some options for you to use and hopefully you will never ever have to use them,” Rhodes said. “They’re easy enough that hopefully in a stressful situation, once you get over the ‘oh my gosh, this is actually happening’ moment, that this will jump out at you, then everybody’s surprised, bad guy and you.”Geary is encouraging anyone attending the seminar to wear normal, everyday clothes, rather than workout attire, to get an accurate sense of what it would be like to respond to an attacker in what one might wear to class or an evening out with friends.Geary said she also hopes people do not feel intimidated by the physical defense practice.“I don’t want someone to not come because they’re worried about the physical part of it,” Geary said. “Because there’s going to be plenty of information giving and you can watch.”In addition to physical defense, Rhodes will incorporate general safety information as well, discussing what he calls the two types of strength: strength of body and strength of mind.“There’s strength of body, which most guys are stronger than most women,” Rhodes said. “But there’s strength of mind, which evens the playing field because knowledge is power, and if you have the knowledge of what to do in a situation and you’ve practiced and you actually know what to do, then you’ll be surprised at what you can do.”',\n",

Though the structure and form of the committee have not been fully laid out yet, the large amount of initial interest is encouraging, Shu said.The plan for now is to model the committee after PHA’s Safe Sisters, which focuses on sexual assault, or the Body Project, which focuses on body image, by creating a training program for new members and bringing in educational speakers to talk about different aspects of mental health, Shu said.“All of these programs are clearly separate entities, but serve similar purposes,” said Mackenzie Clinger, a junior in Alpha Omicron Pi who is a member of the new committee. “So while we don’t want to take away from what Safe Sisters and the Body Project are doing, it makes sense to partner with them and come together to create different events with them.”Another goal is for members of the committee to be everyday points of contact for sorority chapter members, said Rose Lowery, a member of the committee from Kappa Delta. It is easier to create a wider dialogue about mental health issues by starting small with friends and classmates, she said.“Mental health problems are something that affect a much wider group of people than a lot of students realize,” Lowery said. “I wish it was a conversation that started even before students got to college. Our goal is to make sure that nobody feels like they have to struggle alone.”More long-term goals for the committee include the creation of subcommittees for specific aspects of mental health and potential collaboration with the Interfraternity Council and the rest of campus, said Sara Dobbins, who will be taking over as the PHA’s vice president of personal development in the spring.The first year of the mental health committee will be considered a learning year as its members figure out what types of events and campaigns work best, Dobbins said. She said she wants the process of developing the committee to be as collaborative as possible.The Interfraternity Council has also put measures addressing mental health into place.Trevor Wolf is the IFC’s first director of mental health. In the new position, he has taken the approach of improving proactive education on mental health so fraternity brothers know how to help each other before a bigger problem arises, he said.“There are so many times when the only way we can get people to talk about mental health is after something horrible happens, and it shouldn’t just be something to talk about after the fact,” Lowery said. “That proactivity is how it should be talked about, and that’s what we’re trying to encourage as a community.”While the committee sees the need for further mental health conversation and hopes to see continuing involvement, the real hope behind its creation is that it will someday no longer be needed, Dobbins said.“Our end goal is actually that the mental health committee will be dissolved because that would mean that we wouldn’t have such drastic mental health issues to address,” Dobbins said. “It would be great to no longer have the problem, to see students feel safe and healthy. But because there’s a need for it now, I’m excited to be able to help.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'More cases of sexual assault have been reported this semester than in recent years — more than twice as many as the department’s semester average, Lt. Andy Stephenson of the IU Police Department said.Stephenson said the department typically investigates three or four incidents of reported sexual assault per semester. In the fall 2015 semester IUPD has investigated at least 10 reports.Despite the increase of sexual assaults reported, Stephenson said he does not believe there is an increase in the crime occurring.“I’ve been with the IU Police Department for a long time,” Stephenson said. “I believe that it’s a result of us getting out there meeting with students and talking about this and encouraging people to report this crime.”IUPD Sgt. Rebecca Schmuhl said she believes more reports are coming in directly after assaults rather than being reported after time has passed. She said this is likely because victims are coming forward with friends.“I think that is the main reason we are seeing more reports,” Schmuhl said. “More victims are finding support networks almost immediately after the incident so that they feel that they can report it and have somebody help them do it.”However, by Stephenson’s estimates, only between 40 and 50 percent of these cases reported have resulted in arrest.In investigations that commonly span weeks or even months, it can often be difficult to prove guilt.Stephenson said victims and suspects are often acquaintances, each side with his or her own story.“A vast majority of these cases are not violent stranger attacks,” Stephenson said. “It’s very, very, very rarely an attack by a stranger.”Investigators start by interviewing the victim and examining the crime scene, if one can be identified. Officers take statements from any potential friends or witnesses who may have seen the victim in the time leading up to the alleged assault.Schmuhl said arranging interviews with witnesses can take anywhere between a few days to months, depending on the case.In some reports where partying has been involved, Schmuhl said she may interview dozens of witnesses to build a better case to send to the prosecutor’s office. Schmuhl said she aims to determine if alcohol had been a factor and if the victim was legally allowed to give consent at the time of the alleged assault.“We are attempting to provide a report to the prosecutors office that can eliminate the possible defenses that the assailant may come up with,” Schmuhl said. “Usually those are going to fall into the claim that it was a consensual encounter or that they were not involved at all or that no crime took place.”Stephenson said it can be difficult to prosecute or make arrests because these cases rely on conflicting testimonies between the suspect and victim.Bed sheets, pillowcases and underwear are among items commonly sent to a state police crime lab to be processed for DNA evidence, Stephenson said. However, this process takes time.“It’s not like television where you submit evidence to the crime lab and wait by the telephone for five minutes before they give me a result,” Stephenson said. “It takes weeks, sometimes months.”In addition to DNA evidence results, Stephenson said it takes time for paperwork to go through the court system and for medical records to come through.After results have come in, all evidence has been collected and a potential suspect has been interviewed, officers can submit a report to the prosecutor’s office, where they can then decide whether or not to press charges.Stephenson said arrests are made more frequently in cases involving random assaults because guilt is easier to prove.However, identifying a suspect can be more difficult if the victim does not know his or her attacker. Investigators process the crime scene and its evidence, interview potential witnesses and try to develop potential suspects while they await DNA evidence results, so when this evidence has been processed, they can compare it to DNA already existing in their system or to a suspect from a court order.Stephenson said frequent complications in investigations include students leaving or graduating from the University and students have friends visiting from out of town. Schmuhl has traveled as far as St. Louis to interview suspects, conduct phone interviews and work with local police departments outside of Bloomington to investigate such cases.The best thing someone can do to assist an investigation if they believe they are a victim of sexual assault is to immediately go to the IU Health Bloomington Hospital to complete a sexual assault kit, Stephenson said.The examination kits are conducted by nurses who are specially trained. Victims have the option of completing kits anonymously, a practice that began three to four years ago.The evidence kits are then given to the police without releasing names for evidence storage for a year.Stephenson said victims should take this step even if they do not plan to report their assault, because evidence of a sexual assault can be destroyed within a matter of hours.Schmuhl said each victim reacts differently to reporting a very personal crime.She said it’s something victims do not always want to talk about, but some feel it helps to talk to someone who is taking their complaint seriously.“If the process allows the victim to at least have a say in that final judgment, then it will assist them hopefully over the long run in finding some sort of peace about what happened to them,” Schmuhl said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'During a recent checkup at the IU Health Center, I was filling out a health questionnaire when I realized there were several questions I could not answer.When was my last Pap smear? Had I even gotten one before?Yes, I sound foolish. But I was unsure. The nurse practitioner recommended that I should, since I was 21.And in light of tragic events at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs last Friday, I’d like to remind everyone of the numerous health services Planned Parenthood provides that have absolutely nothing to do with “baby parts.”So here’s a quick breakdown of some reproductive services us college-aged ladies might need.A Pap test screens for cancers or precancers in the cervix, according to womenshealth.gov. It checks the cervix for abnormal cell changes, which, if not treated, might lead to cervical cancer.Women need a Pap smear to detect potentially cancerous cells to prevent cervical cancer. The Office on Women’s Health, a section of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, states “women ages 21 to 65 should get Pap tests as part of routine health care — even if you are not sexually active.”Though some women might need more frequent Pap tests, you should get one every three years.The Affordable Care Act also covers Pap tests, so most insurance plans will pay for them. Thanks a lot, Obama.Human papillomavirus, or HPV, tests are done as a follow-up to a Pap test that finds abnormal cells or unclear results. For women 30 or older, HPV tests can be done at the same time as Pap tests, according to Planned Parenthood.To prevent cervical cancer, Planned Parenthood recommends getting regular screenings, using condoms and talking with your doctor about whether you should get the HPV vaccine.The most common feminine problem us ladies face is a yeast infection, or vaginitis.According to Mayo Clinic, vaginal yeast infections affect up to three out of four women in their lifetimes. Some women suffer from recurring infections — four or more within a year.I’ll refrain from listing the symptoms here, but you’ll know when something down there is off.Though opinions certainly diverge, I believe women 18 or older should be on some form of birth control, whether they are sexually active or not.The IU Health Center Women’s Health clinic provides all the services I mentioned, and plenty more I could not cover here.The clinic provides STI testing, routine exam and Pap testing, education for birth control options, evaluation of problems like vaginal infections and irregular periods and counseling for abnormal pap results.It also provides testing for infections related to sexual assault through Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner. If you need help, get help.Get checked out. Your vagina will thank you later.nrowthor@indiana.edu@nrowthornIU',\n",

       "  'body': 'Nearly a year after the Campus Community Coalition decided to start meeting monthly, Sara Ivey Lucas, assistant dean of students for parents and off-campus student affairs, said she still feels somewhat surprised the group always has more to discuss than fits into the group’s hour-long meetings.The Campus Community Coalition, or C3, brings together people from the IU administration, IU Police Department, Bloomington Police Department, Housing and Neighborhood Development department for Bloomington and other city and campus representatives to discuss issues pertinent to IU and Bloomington. IU Student Association Chief of Staff Sara Zaheer sits in on the coalition.The organization’s most recent meeting occurred Nov. 11, where they spent some time considering the results of a student safety survey.Lucas said the survey conveyed students feel safest on campus followed by the downtown area near Kirkwood Avenue and feel least safe in off-campus areas.“We spent a lot of time talking in the Dean of Students office about why that is, and what that means and how we can help students feel safer in those areas that are just off campus but aren’t officially on campus,” Lucas said. “We shared with our partners that work in the city that’s largely an area that is under their control.”Zaheer said the survey also pointed out students felt unsafe because of inadequate lighting and poor sidewalks off campus.It was discussed during the meeting how those issues should be brought up to landlords and students could ask for improvements in those areas before signing a lease, Zaheer said.Zaheer said the law requires landlords maintain sidewalks and, potentially, part of the law could be extended to include adequate lighting. That may be something an organization like IUSA could pursue.“I got encouraging ideas from them, but I can’t pursue every single one,” Zaheer said. “A lot of those ideas get passed on to other people, but it’s good that I’m there to write down everything they say.”Lucas said the coalition also discussed the relationship between alcohol and issues of consent and specifically how restaurants and bars in town could help support and promote safety and student responsibility.Regarding issues of sexual assault, Zaheer said Lucas intends to meet with landlords of apartment complexes in the city next semester to discuss these landlords taking part in bystander-intervention training.The idea originated when a student approached Zaheer asking for assistance with bringing bystander-intervention training to her apartment complex, Zaheer said.“It would become a selling point for apartment complexes to say, ‘We offer this, too, so you’ll feel more safe,” Zaheer said.Lisa Abbott, director of the Housing and Neighborhood Development department for Bloomington said being a part of C3 helps with the educational process for the department, so it can distribute information about campus happenings to other parties.This year, HAND cooperated with IU to distribute materials about Culture of Care to landlords in Bloomington, in addition to other outreach and marketing events, Abbott said.“The more partnerships that you build, the more the coalition spreads its influence and works with other partners, the better the environment becomes for everybody,” Abbott said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'After a Toronto police officer’s advice to women for staying safe on campus was to dress less like “sluts in order not be victimized,” the first SlutWalk was born, according to thinkprogress.org. That was four years ago.As you might guess, the officer’s remarks sparked outrage in women across the globe. The first SlutWalk was conducted to take back the degrading term “slut” and the idea women are responsible for the sexual violence enacted upon them.This past October, a new spokesperson and activist for the cause, Amber Rose, has brought a attention to the term “slut” and these SlutWalks. She has experienced slut-shaming for being a stripper as well as for her sexual history with Kanye West and her son’s father, Wiz Khalifa.With Rose’s large social media platform and celebrity status, she was the host of one of the largest SlutWalks. Hundreds of walkers —men and women — joined Rose in Los Angeles’ Pershing Square.Walkers were encouraged to wear whatever they wanted, and they did, wearing everything from lingerie to being topless. Rose discussed her first experience of being slut-shamed at 14. She also noted West’s comment saying he “needed ‘30 showers’ after being with her” and Khalifa’s saying she was nothing but a stripper, according to CNN.Rose’s goal in the SlutWalk was not only to reduce the derogatory degree of the term “slut” but to be inclusive of all groups of people who are marginalized and shamed.On her SlutWalk Los Angeles website’s homepage it reads, “...we recognize that shaming, oppression, assault and violence have disproportionately impacted marginalized groups, including women of color, transgender people and sex workers, and thus we are actively working to center these groups in this event.”I find these SlutWalks to be amazing because not only are they asking for victims of sexual assault to not be slut-shamed but they’re inclusive in asking sex workers, transgender people and women of color not be as well.Rose hasn’t stopped her feminist activism at the SlutWalk either. At this year’s MTV Video Music Awards, she and Blac Chyna wore clothing with derogatory terms written all over them, such as “gold digger,” “whore” and “stripper.”Rose also participated in a Funny or Die video, “Walk of No Shame.” The video shows Rose walking out of a house in what looks to be the clothes she was wearing the night prior. One of my favorite parts is when a mailman walks up to Rose after she tells him she did, indeed, have sex last night and says, “Sounds like you’re living your best life.”As I am someone who hates the word “slut,” I support Rose’s activism to end slut-shaming not only for victims of sexual assault and rape but women who are sex workers and women who are sexual beings.By the way, all women are sexual beings. Just as all men are. Just because we are women doesn’t change our sexuality, nor does the clothing we wear determine our consent.I never understood the reason behind being called a slut. Who gets to determine who is a slut based on their sexuality, gender or field of work? More importantly, why aren’t men ever called sluts?As for me, I’m going to follow Rose’s direction. Rather than shaming women with the word “slut,” instead I’m going to use it to empower myself and other women.prhurst@indiana.edu@IDSPeyton',\n",

       "  'body': 'My biggest fear in life is being assaulted.It is a fear that frequently bombards my thoughts, especially as I walk alone at night.Waking up at 2:22 a.m. last Friday morning to an IU Alert that a woman was assaulted in Dunn Woods by two men, possibly armed with a knife, only heightens this fear.The attack happened on campus near the Sample Gates in a well-lit area. I walked home alone just an hour before she did.This easily could have happened to me.And the odds are not so slim. One out of five undergraduate women at IU reported being the victim of an attempted or an actual rape in the campus-wide survey released this fall.If this doesn’t shake you, there is something horribly wrong.I am growing tired of reading about reported rapes in the dorms. We call it breaking news, but when is the news no longer breaking if sexual assault, rape and battery become so commonplace on this campus?I am growing tired of receiving alerts on my phone in the middle of the night.I am tired of being afraid when I walk home from class late at night and reprimanding myself for listening to music in case someone comes up behind me. Because it’s my fault if I didn’t hear my attacker approaching, right?I am tired of wondering what might happen if I risk walking home alone from the bars at night. Whether I am perfectly sober or not, I have a right to feel and be safe.An app on my cell phone, like the Companion App, is not going to stop an assault. Instead, it slaps a used band-aid on the problem along with the responsibility, falling once again, on the woman to protect herself.I am sick of this backward rhetoric.If I call my friend while I’m walking alone, maybe no one will approach me. If I clutch my can of pepper spray as I walk, maybe I can fight off an attacker. If I promise to text my friends that I got home safely, they’ll know if something bad happened.Whether I take these useless precautions or not, being assaulted is something which I have no control of.I can’t really say I care that nearly 95 percent of IU undergraduates have “participated in some sort of program, event, training or class” dealing with sexual assault, President Michael McRobbie.We are breeding a culture of fear, not a culture of care.Education programs must begin at an earlier stage, and the responsibility should be on the University administration to end this culture of rape.If IU handled sexual assault cases as strictly and as seriously as it handles underage drinking cases, maybe some progress could be made.It’s on all of us, IU.nrowthor@indiana.edu@nrowthornIU',\n",

       "  'body': 'Film director and IU alumnus David Burkman tries to make movies about profound experiences in his own life. One of those experiences inspired a movie that brought him back to IU on Sunday night.A screening of Burkman’s film “HAZE” was presented Sunday night in the Whittenberger Auditorium.The four IU greek councils, the Interfraternity Council, the Panhellenic Association, the Multicultural Greek Council and the National Panhellenic Council, sponsored the film viewing and following discussion.“HAZE” follows the story of a college freshman intending to join a fraternity in the aftermath of a hazing death on campus.Though the film is not a documentary, the inspiration for the story was drawn from Burkman’s own experiences and observations as a member of a fraternity.“I had noted that Hollywood is obsessed with depictions of greek life but always in a sort of comedic way, and there hadn’t really been a film that dealt with it in a truthful, honest way in all its facets,” Burkman said. “This film asks us what the nature of friendship is and how we bond as brothers, and whether it’s necessary to go through conflict or hardship to do that.”“HAZE” has been shown at the Birmingham, Alabama, Sidewalk Film Festival and the Orlando Film Festival.The screening at IU was the first showing of the movie on a college campus, although the target audience of the film had always been college-aged individuals, Burkman said.“People always said that this would be a great thing to show at different colleges,” said Jayme Aronberg, the film’s producer. “But we never really thought about that in the beginning until we realized what a great platform it could be to get to the audience that needs to see it the most.”Screening the movie at IU seemed like a natural fit, Burkman said, since he was once a student here.The four greek councils reached out to the makers of the film after an open discussion with the Office of Student Life and Learning about the message the film screening would send, said Margaret Hensley, president of the IU Panhellenic Association.The showing of “HAZE” was open to all IU students. It was followed by a question and answer session with Burkman and Aronberg, as well as small group discussions about the themes of the movie.“With the screening of this film, we want students to understand that we take the issue of hazing very seriously as a greek organization,” Hensley said. “Engaging students on a large scale with events like this is the best and most effective method we can use to get students involved in conversations about tough issues.”The showing was part of a heightened effort by IU’s greek organizations throughout the semester to address issues that are common on college campuses, said Jesse Scheinman, overseer of the Interfraternity Council’s Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault program.Other movie showings, open lectures or discussions and an emphasis on educational and leadership programs have also been part of this effort.“We all hope that this movie, and all the other things we do, allow people to reflect on our purpose, our values and the reasons our greek organizations exist in the first place,” Scheinman said. “There is always something that can be done to drive the conversation forward on creating a safer environment.”The makers of the film are in talks with film distributors about the possibility of a wider release of the movie.They also hope to use the IU screening of “HAZE” as a starting point for future screenings at universities around the country, Aronberg said.“This is a film that is meant to provoke because it’s about a sensitive issue, and the hope is that it gets people talking and thinking a little more about what they’re doing,” Burkman said. “After the film is finished and presented, it’s the creator’s responsibility to let go of it a little. After that, it falls into the hands of the students who see it whether or not to take action and create positive change.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'When Cecilia Peck was approached by Linor Abargil, 1998 Miss World pageant winner, to create a documentary about the story of her sexual assault, she thought it would be a one-year documentary. It eventually became a five-year project, and even after its release, Peck said it continues to influence the work that she does.Peck, director and producer of “Brave Miss World,” visited IU to speak to students at a screening of the documentary Tuesday evening. The film screening and discussion led by Peck were sponsored by the Helene G. Simon Hillel Center as well as several campus greek organizations, including Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Zeta Beta Tau, Sigma Alpha Mu, Sigma Delta Tau and Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault, an initiative of the Interfraternity Council.The documentary tells the story of the aftermath of Abargil’s assault and winning of the pageant, which drove her to advocate for victims of sexual assault throughout the world. The film follows the story of Abargil’s journey toward recovery as well as stories of other survivors of sexual assault.“Once I found in Linor such a compelling character, I was committed to seeing the project through no matter how long it took,” Peck said. “She was so unafraid to speak out about rape, and I knew she could take the audience on that journey even though it’s such an unpopular subject and it’s so hard to talk about.”“Brave Miss World,” which was nominated for an Emmy award in 2014, has now been shown at more than 200 college campuses through the “I Am Brave Educational Speaking Series.” The documentary’s website, bravemissworld.com, has more than 2 million visitors and is a resource for survivors of sexual assault. Peck, as well as Abargil and other producers of the film, continue to travel to many of the campus showings to speak.“Screening the film on college campuses was always a big goal even when we were making it,” Peck said. “It’s a very vulnerable age, and it’s a group we wanted to reach out to.”The idea to bring the film to IU’s campus and turn it into a larger event was put forth by members of a class for Jewish greek leadership at the Hillel Center, Rabbi Sue Laikin Silberberg, executive director of Hillel, said.“We talk about a number of different issues, one of them being rape and sexual assault, and after that the event really took on a life of its own,” Silberberg said. “The students took it over and ran with it, which is really great, because the only way to make a difference with things like this is if it comes from the students themselves and they care about it.”Before the screening and discussion, the Hillel Center organized a dinner and panel between representatives from the sponsoring greek organizations, IU Sexual Assault Crisis Services, the Middle Way House and other groups involved with raising awareness of sexual assault.“I think one of the biggest issues with sexual assault is not wanting to stand up and say anything about it,” said Elli Bock, vice president of Sigma Delta Tau. “If you see other people talking about it, you’re more likely to speak out, and I think this documentary helps with that and promotes the idea that you shouldn’t be embarrassed to talk about it.”The documentary has become a vehicle for education about definitions of consent, ways to speak up about sexual assault and encouraging bystander intervention, Peck said. The point the film is meant to drive home is the importance of breaking the silence surrounding the issue of sexual assault, Peck said.“The worst thing we can do is stay silent,” Peck said. “This is a hard issue to talk about, and when you’re affected by it, you have to fight hard to be able to do it. But the important thing is that we can.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The fraternity and sorority system, both at IU and across the nation, is undergoing a facelift.In light of the increased scandals regarding hazing, drug and alcohol abuse, and sexual assault, Greek organizations and universities alike are responding by implementing policies designed to create more safe environments and to help rid Greek life of the “Animal House” stereotype.But one controversial policy proposed by IU’s Student Life and Learning goes beyond ensuring a safe atmosphere — it demands that in order to be recognized by the University, fraternities and sororities must agree to allow IU police officers the “right to enter and inspect any and all rooms” within their houses at any time.Not only is this draconian policy more than intrusive, it encroaches upon our rights laid out in the Constitution.The Fourth Amendment provides one of the most fundamental rights that we have in America — the right to have our private lives free from unreasonable governmental searches and seizures. Specifically, it requires the government to first obtain a warrant in order to conduct a search on a person’s house. It’s purposefully designed to keep sacred our privacies of life.The policy proposed by the University clearly flies in the face of the Fourth Amendment; by mandating that fraternities and sororities allow police to enter and inspect any room at any time, the University presents a disturbing ultimatum: either forfeit your basic freedoms and permit the police to enter your living-quarters at any time for any reason — or none at all — or join a different student organization and move out of your house.Do we really want our public university to strong-arm its students into letting police enter the rooms of their Greek houses — many of which are on private property — at any time? Of course not. And if the University were to get away with doing this to students in fraternities and sororities, what’s to stop it from ultimately coercing all of its students to relinquish their freedoms?Fraternity men and sorority women at IU account for nearly 20 percent of the student body. Outside of their excellence in the classroom, they are leaders in the community and are responsible for raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for philanthropic causes every year. And while there is certainly the need to ensure that these young men and women live in safe environments, there is no evidence this policy would even be effective at accomplishing that goal.Considering police can already enter a house, whether that house has Greek letters on it or not, by first obtaining a warrant — or by a showing of exigent circumstances — it is thus unnecessary for the University to attempt to contravene this legal framework by implementing a policy giving them absolute authority to enter private residences. To stay silent while the University implements this policy would be antithetical to our notion of freedom and would be one more step in the direction of a police state.Casey LeechIU Maurer School of Law student',\n",

       "  'body': 'It’s a sad day in our nation when citizens overwhelmingly vote against equal rights and in favor of discrimination.Sixty-one percent of Houston voters did exactly that Nov. 3 in a referendum on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which prohibited bias and discrimination in housing, employment, business services and city contracting, according to the New York Times. Only 39 percent of voters voted in favor of keeping the ordinance.Many of those who voted against it were no doubt swayed by a virulent campaign that played on transphobia and ignorance to suggest that HERO, passed by the Houston City Council 18 months ago, would result in a wave of sexual assaults by transgender women against cisgender women in public bathrooms.Using the slogan “No Men in Women’s Bathrooms,” opponents of equal rights for transgender people pandered to the voting public’s ignorance about who and what transgender people are and are not. They argued rejecting HERO would protect “our grandmoms and our mothers and our wives and our sisters and our daughters and our granddaughters,” in the words of Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an opponent of the ordinance.Nevermind that transgender women are not men, they go into bathrooms for the same reasons as the rest of us, and there are exactly zero documented cases of sexual predators posing as transgender to attack cisgender people in bathrooms, according to mic.com.The Twitter hashtag #wejustneedtopee shows just how ridiculous it would be to try to force people to use the bathroom of a gender they don’t identify as. Burly, bearded transgender man Michael C. Hughes posted a now-viral selfie he took in a women’s bathroom to Twitter with the hashtag. Is Michael’s presence in a women’s bathroom really the outcome anti-HERO voters were hoping for?Interestingly, it is trans people, not cisgender folks, who are at a far higher risk of being attacked in public bathrooms — or anywhere else. As of late August of this year, 20 trans women had been murdered in 2015, apparently the victims of anti-transgender hate crimes.Transgender people also attempt suicide at far higher numbers than non-transgender people, with 41 percent of transgender people having attempted suicide as opposed to 1.6 percent of the general population, according to lambdalegal.org.We, the Editorial Board, believe not only is the hatred directed against transgender people in the anti-HERO campaign abhorrent, it has also led voters to strike down legislation that would have helped many groups of people, not just transgender people trying to use the bathroom.The ordinance offered protection from discrimination to all people and covered 15 different categories including sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity and pregnancy.Apparently, the loss of protection against discrimination for all these categories was just collateral damage in the eyes of those who campaigned against the ordinance.This Editorial Board thinks no one’s rights should ever be put to a vote.What would our country look like today if the questions of interracial marriage and school segregation had been decided by majority vote in the 1950s?The anti-HERO campaign played to the lowest common denominator, fear, in order to deny rights and equal protection under the law to an entire class of people.Opponents of equal rights for transgender people might be declaring victory in Houston, but let’s make no mistake: the rejection of HERO is a loss for us all, transgender and non-transgender alike.',\n",

       "  'body': 'In the only resolution presented at its Friday meeting, the Graduate and Professional Student Government passed an amendment to its bylaws that formally created the health and wellness committee out of what used to be the student affairs committee.The amendment said the committee would maintain standing relationships with the Health Center, Culture of Care and Counseling and Psychological Services.“The committee will take a holistic approach to health and wellness, including campus safety and a number of other things that go beyond just physical health,” said Skyler Hutto, vice president and chair of the new committee.The amendment said the vice president will chair the committee, as was true of the student affairs committee, or a person can be designated by the executive committee to chair the health and wellness committee.Debate arose about that part of the amendment because an appointed head to the committee would be uncompensated, though the other committee heads are compensated.Verdi said the issues raised in discussion about the committee are necessary and should be addressed moving forward, but added that he felt it was important to codify the committee as soon as possible.“The issues that the health and wellness committee are tackling aren’t going to wait for us to figure out internally how best to handle them,” Verdi said.Additionally, during the meeting, diversity officer Brittany Witherspoon announced progress from her committee’s efforts regarding disability access on campus for graduate students.The committee inquired as to why graduate students could not use the shuttle, which helps transport physically-disabled students around campus to get to a teaching assignment.Graduate students could request the shuttle when they needed it to get to their classes but could not request the shuttle when they needed to get to a class they taught.Witherspoon met with administrators, and now graduate students can use the shuttle to get to their teaching assignments if they are temporarily or permanently physically disabled.GPSG did not have to write a resolution for the change.“Disability Services’ priority was getting students to class,” Witherspoon said. “I posed the question, then, of what happens when associate instructor or teaching assistant gets temporarily impaired and can’t go to teach their classes ... Moving forward, (administrators) want to address that in their policy.”At the beginning of the meeting, IU Police Department Sgt. Rebecca Schmuhl spoke to the assembly about sexual assault. She discussed the role of graduate students, particularly with regards to reporting incidents.Verdi said one main point Schmuhl made was that if an incident occurs, the Title IX coordinator for IU, Emily Springston, not just the police, should be contacted.“It was good for her to be able to tell us exactly who to refer this stuff to because she said the common myth is that you just call the police,” Verdi said.Another point Schmul made, Verdi said, was if an incident occurs between a student and a non-student, it can and will still be investigated by IUPD, and it is no less valid to report such an incident than to report an incident between two students.The role of graduate students relative to sexual assault can be different than undergraduate students, since graduates students are often in a staff role where a student might confide in them about an incident, Verdi said.Because of this role, Verdi said it is important for graduate students to understand the procedures regarding sexual assault reporting on campus.“That can be a distressing time for not only the person, obviously, providing that information, but the person receiving it,” Verdi said. “There’s a lot of leadership expected of students on campus.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Let’s not beat around the bush. “Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse” is garbage.The question is was it good garbage or bad garbage?The film centers around three high school-aged boy scouts who have been friends since they were children.There’s Ben, the sensible and spineless leader of the group. How this works, I don’t know, but the movie was written by the same people who wrote “College Road Trip,” so I wouldn’t waste my breath asking questions.Carter is the obnoxious second-in-command. He represents every stereotype about high school boys.Finally, we have Augie, the gentle giant. He’s more invested in scouts than his friends and cast as the loser of the trio through the totally not cliché and offensive character devices of his weight and emotional expressiveness.The scouts program has dwindled to just the three of them and their overly enthusiastic mentor, Scout Leader Rogers.After holding on to the past for so long, Ben and Carter are ready to call it quits. They agree to one more camping trip before they take off the uniform for good.Plans change when Ben and Carter are invited to “the secret party” — an infamous blowout all the cool kids go to — because it’s 2015 and we’re still upholding the idea that the amount of Abercrombie and Fitch in your closet determines your social value and gives you the ability to find abandoned buildings to throw massive raves in.Carter is so thirsty he convinces Ben to sneak away from camp in the middle of the night to attend the party and make their social debut.But when the boys return to town they get more than they bargained for as zombies begin attacking them.They team up with Denise, a girl they briefly went to high school with, to defeat the zombies and find the party before the entire town is bombed.The film gives a pretty accurate depiction of high school students in terms of looks and attitude of the three main characters. The dialogue is realistic and at its best when the three are bickering.There are just a few scenes that make absolutely no sense.In one scene, the boys go to an abandoned strip club and a woman who is clearly a zombie starts dancing and manages to get her top off before her throat explodes and drenches the boys in blood — because plot be damned if you can get a titty shot.Then there’s the scene where the boys are running away from the zombies and a female zombie’s shirt is caught in fence and torn off. Not only is there an uncomfortable close up of boobs, but Carter takes a moment from running for his life to give them a squeeze. But, you know, who cares about sexual assault when you get another titty shot? Not director Christopher Landon.“Scouts Guide” could have been just another trash comedy, a subpar “Zombieland” you would rather forget, but it went too far.I’m not in the business of ignoring social issues for the sake of entertainment.The answer is bad garbage.

       "  'body': 'New details have emerged about the tragedy of IU student Yaolin Wang’s death Sept. 30, and they paint a grim picture. Even before Wang was killed by her abuser, our University and community had failed her.We have not, as a community, engaged in the difficult but potentially life-saving conversations about domestic abuse and relationship violence that might have helped Wang escape the man she called her “nightmare.”We all share in this failing, but the ultimate failure is at the level of the University itself. Required by federal law to provide a safe learning environment for all students, IU has instead demonstrated a failure of leadership.Rather than face the enormous challenge of addressing these issues, IU has engaged in — and continues to engage in — the bare-bones minimum the government requires of it — and sometimes not even that much.While campus sexual assault, including rape, dominates Indiana Daily Student headlines, domestic abuse and relationship violence continue to quietly destroy lives. Though sexual assault and rape remain a huge problem in our community, we are at least beginning to have conversations about them. As clichéd as the term might sound, awareness of these issues appears to be increasing amongst IU students.However, when it comes to abuse of the sort that led to Wang’s murder, our campus — and our administration — is disturbingly silent.According to an IDS report on the abuse leading up to Wang’s death, her friends repeatedly discouraged her from calling the police for help. Her roommate reportedly told her in a message that because Wang and her abuser were “both students who have to go to school,” she should avoid getting police involved.Her roommate’s response to the situation might appear naïve in hindsight. But, unfortunately, such attitudes and responses are all too common. Abuse is often minimized by friends and family who don’t understand its seriousness or its potential lethality.Wang’s roommate and friends are also victims. They are now saddled with intense feelings of guilt about Wang’s murder. One of her friends, Xu Gao, has decided not to pursue counseling services because she feels that she must “have a scar to remind me not to make the same mistake again,” according to the IDS.Nancy Stockton, director of IU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), said in the IDS that victims rarely come forward, saying, “The abuser’s control over the woman is nearly absolute.” But is CAPS even prepared to recognize and appropriately respond to abusive situations when victims do come to CAPS for help?Having been told by a senior CAPS counselor that the individual “didn’t know” I was being abused, even after my abuser stated outright in a couples counseling session that he had hit me, I can only think that the answer is no.We can stop this from happening again. The University must demonstrate leadership — through adequately training CAPS counselors, through working to raise student awareness of abuse and through starting and facilitating a campus-wide discussion.No one else needs to die.woodsmj@indiana.edu@miriamjwoods',\n",

       "  'body': 'With Halloween weekend approaching, the IU Student Association said it wants to set the record straight.Any intoxicated minors calling for help in a medical emergency will be immune to criminal prosecution. It’s spelled out in the Indiana Lifeline Law, which carries protections for minors drinking, transporting and possessing alcohol.Though the Lifeline Law is not new, freshman IUSA intern Olivia Malone said she fears unfounded hearsay regarding the law may keep people from calling police in a situation.“I just know that coming onto this campus and going to the IUSA orientation and having Culture of Care talk, we had a lot of questions and a lot of them were really valid,” Malone said.After several weeks of planning, IUSA has launched a campaign via social media and speaking tours to help expel common uncertainties about the law.“It’s important to talk about before Halloween obviously,” Malone said. “Because it’s going to be a crazy weekend, and just in general because, from a freshman perspective, if you tell people this is how it works, they can spread that around to their freshmen friends.”According to IU Police Department Lt. Andy Stephenson, the Lifeline Law prohibits arrest and prosecution for public intoxication, minor alcohol possession, minor alcohol consumption and minor alcohol transportation as long as those making the call to police stay on the scene and fully cooperate with officers.If those at the scene refuse to cooperate with officers and become disorderly, they may be arrested on a separate charge.The Lifeline Law does not offer protections for providing alcohol to minors, operating vehicles while intoxicated or possessing a controlled substance.“It’s only alcohol,” junior IUSA chief of staff Sara Zaheer said. ”We want people to call, but we don’t want people to expect to be protected for drugs.”While the Lifeline Law currently does not provide immunity for drug-induced issues, it was recently revised in July to provide immunity to intoxicated minors when reporting an instance of sexual assault.Stephenson said IUPD had similar procedures before the Lifeline Law.“Lifeline Law had absolutely no impact on the Indiana University Police Department,” Stephenson said. “None, because that’s the way we operated anyway. If somebody calls for help, we’re not going to arrest them.”Stephenson advised students use common sense during Halloween weekend like removing masks when walking, driving or entering a store or business.“Just be responsible,” Stephenson said. “If you’re at parties and you go to a party with a group, leave the party with the same group.”He also warned students not to take drinks from strangers and to drive safely, as pedestrian traffic will be heavier this weekend.In reference to Halloween weekend, Zaheer urged students to keep the Lifeline Law in mind.“Just make the call,” Zaheer said. “Look after your friends and yourself and have fun.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Should the city of Houston keep its equal rights ordinance? Believe it or not, this is a real question being asked of Houstonians leading up to the Nov. 3 mayoral election, according to the Guardian.It sounds like a no-brainer for the city to keep the equal protection ordinance, but apparently the issue is not so simple for Houston.The ordinance, No. 2014-530, or Proposition 1, as it’s known, “prohibits discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment and housing,” according to the Guardian.Although the ordinance would seem entirely devoid of reasoning for debate, prohibiting discrimination of gender identity has incited a battle over the ordinance possibly violating religious freedom and aiding sexual predators.The religious freedom argument is fairly ubiquitous for Christians who feel like their values are being discriminated against, but their claiming the equal protection ordinance helps sexual predators violate people seems pointed. You guessed it. The controversy is pointed directly at transgender people, specifically transgender women.Proposition 1 has been portrayed to the public as a law that has one purpose: to allow for transgender women to enter women’s restrooms and locker rooms. While the law would allow transgender women to use restrooms of their identifying gender without discrimination, it is not the focal point of the law.Adversaries of Proposition 1, such as former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman, claim Proposition 1 “will allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women’s bathrooms, showers and locker rooms,” according to a “Campaign for Houston” YouTube video.Wow, the ignorance is upsettingly real. To call a transgender women a man is incredibly insulting. They have worked hard to overcome obstacles to discover their true identity. Also, to claim transgender women are using a female guise to help them go into women’s restrooms, showers and locker rooms so they can sexually violate other women is simply ridiculous. Such assumptions demonstrate just how deep the transphobia runs.Houston removed language from the equal protection ordinance last year that required Houston business owners to allow transgender persons to use bathrooms that correspond to their gender identities after many protests.The fight over transgender rights went all the way to the Texas Supreme Court, which told the city it either has to repeal the ordinance or vote on the issue. To date, there is no evidence of a transgender woman trying to assault women in Houston bathrooms, according to the Guardian.The entire “bathroom predator” argument surrounding the vote on Proposition 1 is fueled by nothing more than pure ignorance and an extreme fear of people who are different.Here’s the thing, Houstonians: transgender identity has nothing to do with you, and it’s certainly not a threat to the unfortunate gendered use of bathrooms. The religious freedom argument against Proposition 1 is one thing, but the “bathroom predator” argument is blatant fear-mongering, pure discrimination and should be rejected as reasoning to vote against the proposition.rcm2@indiana.edu@RachelCMiller1',\n",

Monica Hernandez helps that right become a reality.Hernandez, a victim advocate with Middle Way House, was awarded a Voices for Victims award Thursday for her work to ensure victims of abusive relationships have access to the assistance and resources they need.Middle Way House is a nonprofit organization that provides emergency housing and shelter to victims of violence and abuse in Bloomington.When she learned she had received the award, Hernandez said she was shocked. She had nominated someone else for the distinction.The award was presented at Middle Way House by Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller. This is the first year that awards of this kind are being given, and only 10 were awarded throughout the state.“We’ve really tried to look at how we can do more in terms of breathing life into our constitutional promise,” Zoeller said. “It takes special, selfless people to live out that promise.”The awards program is part of Indiana’s new Victims Services and Outreach Division, which was established by Zoeller in May 2015.“Monica is one of the most devoted advocates that I’ve had the pleasure of working with,” said Jen Burch, a crisis intervention access coordinator. “She is phenomenal at her job, and she maintains such passion and dedication through her work.”At only 23 years old, Hernandez is currently working two jobs. Along with her position at Middle Way, she works for IU’s Foster International Living-Learning Center.During her time at the center she has worked to raise awareness about rape and sexual assault resources within the city’s Hispanic community.Hernandez is fluent in French and Spanish and is learning Chinese. She recently helped the attorney general’s office by translating new Address Confidentiality and Hope Card materials into French and Spanish. These resources will help non-English speaking victims of abuse acquire a confidential address. This allows them to receive mail without their abusers being able to find them.Hernandez said she likes doing her job in Monroe County because the government has set up a system in which there is a lot of collaboration between government offices and nonprofits such as Middle Way. This way, it’s easy for people to file for protective orders.“Once we actually get to interact with the clients, that’s when I really feel like I’m doing something for them,” Hernandez said. “That one paper can sometimes make such a big difference in their lives.”Hernandez is undecided about what her future career path might be. She said she might attend law school in order to continue advocating for victims in the courtroom.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Becoming a brother of Delta Sigma Phi has been one of the milestones of my college career. I don’t say it emptily nor do I say it hyperbolically. I mean it. The relationships I’ve built and the memories I’ve made through my chapter have shaped who I am as an individual.Joining Delta Sig gave me a sense of purpose: to be a better man, to build a better fraternity, to better the communities to which we belong.That’s why I was dismayed to learn, from Delta Sig’s national executive director no less, of our fraternity throwing its support behind the Safe Campus Act — a piece of federal legislation that would force survivors of sexual assault to report their attacks to law enforcement in order for a college or university to take action against the alleged perpetrator.The legislation in question has the potential to deter survivors of sexual assault from reporting the crime, based on the simple fact that only a small fraction of sexual assaults committed are actually reported to police to begin with.According to “the nation’s largest anti-sexual assault organization,” RAINN, out of every 100 rapes only 32 are reported to police. A study by the United States Department of Justice is even more startling. Eighty percent of female college students aged 18 to 24 who were sexually assaulted between 1995 and 2013 did not report the assault to law enforcement.There are many reasons for not doing so. Survivors can feel ashamed or distraught following an assault.After all, the last thing many would want — as he or she tries to process such a traumatic experience — is to relive it in such a public way, like in a trial. Others are afraid of their peers or family finding out the circumstance in which the assault happened. Fears of retaliation or social stigma can also weigh heavily in the minds of survivors.Making it a requirement for survivors of sexual assault to go to the police has the potential to further deter some from seeking justice, while also tying a college’s hands in disciplining or removing a student that has broken its code of conduct independent of potential criminal charges.I can’t imagine why our fraternity is advocating for such a misguided and dangerous piece of legislation. Moreover, I’m equally astounded as to who we’re getting in bed with in Congress to push for the legislation.Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., an anti-gay conservative, is working with two other Republican co-sponsors, Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Tex., and Rep. Kay Granger R-Tex., to introduce the Safe Campus Act. Sessions has previously blamed gun violence on diversity in America during a radio interview on the Chris Salcedo Show, while Granger previously voted against hate crime legislation, the Defense Authorization Bill, meant to protect LGBTQ Americans in 2009.Delta Sigma Phi’s history underscores the value of different people coming together to move society forward. Our support of this bill runs absolutely counter to those values.I’m proud to call myself a Delta Sig and always will. But I could not be more ashamed of our current position on this matter.edsalas@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Despite only a few weeks to make plans for the event, Sigma Chi’s front yard was crowded Wednesday afternoon.Culture of Care, Safe Sisters, Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault and a large crowd of students came together for an event to raise awareness for sexual assault.“Honestly, this was only planned about three weeks ago, so it’s pretty cool that we came up with the idea and got it up and running so quickly,” Reese Dorger, president of Sigma Chi, said. “About 15 of our brothers took it upon themselves to come together and plan everything.”The awareness event is primarily in response to recent misconduct in the IU greek community as well as a desire to use their fraternity’s house in a positive manner, Dorger said.“It’s an opportunity for all of these organizations to work together actually at a fraternity, which is a little unusual,” Dorger said.Many types of philanthropy events in the greek system focus on raising money for an external cause or organization, but the real goal of the event was to increase awareness of an issue within the community, Dorger said.The event featured a live band and food from BuffaLouie’s at the Gables, as well as numerous speakers. Culture of Care also had a table at the event.“After recent events, as well as the release of the climate survey from the University, it’s obviously really important to do our part to educate students,” said Mackenzie Conrad, a senior and co-chair of Culture of Care. “Now, more than ever, it’s an important thing to discuss so we can try to nip issues in the bud.”The sexual assault climate survey, released Tuesday by IU, made it clear that a stronger stance on the issue of sexual assault is necessary, Conrad said. According to the report, 86 percent of women sexually assaulted at IU as of last fall did not report the incident.“It’s really important for students to realize the need for a better understanding of these issues,” Conrad said. “That is the only way we can start talking about it and try to change it.”Dylan Lanoff, a junior and a co-director for Safe Sisters, a sexual assault awareness organization within the IU Panhellenic Association, spoke briefly in front of the crowd.She focused on consent, coercion, rape and alcohol, emphasizing the importance of going deep into the details of these issues.Representatives from Culture of Care and MARS also spoke, and a panel of students fielding questions on sexual assault was featured as well.Sigma Chi did not initially contact these organizations because of the limited time frame they had to plan the event, said Cullen Hoene, a sophomore in Sigma Chi who helped plan the event.“First we started just reaching out to other fraternities and sororities, but we realized we needed some other leadership in order to make it a better event,” Hoene said. “Sexual assault is a problem that’s not just affecting greek life. It’s a bigger issue that affects humanity as a whole.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Whenever Sen. Jim Merritt, R-Indianapolis, tweets about the Indiana Lifeline Law, he always adds the hashtag #MakeGoodDecisions.Merritt, who helped pass and then expand the law, spends time every fall traveling to different universities around the state to speak about the Lifeline Law.This phrase is what he hopes students learn when they hear him speak, he said.Merritt will speak at the IU Phi Mu sorority house Thursday to explain the law and how it can affect students.“I think students are sometimes afraid to call 911 in emergencies involving alcohol,” said Natalie Maier, vice president of chapter development for Phi Mu and an organizer for Merritt’s visit. “But ultimately, the state doesn’t want us to feel like we have to choose between losing a life and getting in legal trouble.”The Lifeline Law was first passed in 2012 and granted legal immunity to those who call 911 in an alcohol-related medical emergency if they are underage. The law was first proposed by six student body presidents from colleges throughout Indiana, including IU, Purdue University, DePauw University and the University of Southern Indiana.The law received a “yes” vote from every member of the Indiana House and Senate, Merritt said.“We know students aren’t perfect,” Merritt said. “And while we aren’t permitting mistakes that happen, we are acknowledging that it happens, and we want to ask students to make good decisions when it does.”In 2014, Merritt helped to expand the law to grant legal immunity to the person who makes the 911 call, more clearly establishing mitigating circumstances for medical emergencies regarding other illegal substances and allowing first responders to administer overdose intervention drugs.“This law really is an assist to students in emergency situations,” Merritt said.Many of Merritt’s talks at college campuses take place in front of sorority and fraternity audiences. His most recent visit was Monday at Ball State University’s Theta Chi chapter. Merritt estimates in the last three or four years he has spoken to more than 46,000 people in this setting.“When you hear someone saying these things, it helps you put into perspective that saving a life is always more important than the legal implications you’re afraid of,” Maier said. “And it’s important to note that the government itself wants to help reduce that fear.”The bottom line is the law is meant to help keep people safe, Merritt said. He has helped write numerous other pieces of legislation he describes as being in the same family, including bills on drug dealing and abuse, violent crime, overdose intervention and sexual assault.“I plan on being down to as many sororities and fraternities as possible, and I will be doing this for the rest of my career,” Merritt said. “There will always be 17- and 18-year-old students who are new to college life, who are away from their parents for the first time, who need to know what to do if something goes wrong.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'It’s a problem that seemingly won’t go away.Sexual violence — rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence, stalking etc. — continues to stubbornly hang around in the IU community, both on and off campus.The just-released results of a campus-wide survey might be able to help in addressing and solving issues of sexual violence at IU, but they also show just how far we still have to go and how much work remains to be done.More than 7,100 students, both graduate and undergraduate, participated in the survey, which was distributed via email in November 2014.In response to the statement “Indiana University does enough to ensure the safety of students,” 32.1 percent of undergraduate women, 28.2 percent of graduate women, 54.4 percent of undergraduate men and 41.2 percent of graduate men said they either strongly agreed or agreed.Why do so few students, especially women, feel that IU is keeping them safe?The report and McRobbie’s accompanying letter, available online at stop sexualviolence.iu.edu, come across as somewhat self-congratulatory, as though the administration is patting itself on the back for a job well done.Meanwhile, more than one third of undergraduate and graduate women report having been sexually harassed while at IU, and 17 percent of undergraduate women report experiencing “attempted or completed nonconsensual sexual penetration.”To put that into clearer terms, nearly one in five undergraduate women reports having been the victim of an actual or attempted rape while a student at IU.This is absolutely unacceptable, but it confirms the headlines we see almost every day in the Indiana Daily Student.Rape and other sexual violence should not be so commonplace that they are no longer breaking news but rather everyday occurrences in our community.McRobbie’s letter brags “nearly 95 percent of our undergraduate students have participated in some sort of program, event, training or class that deals with sexual assault or gender-related issues.”We say these programs must not be working, since around half of women responding to the survey and almost 40 percent of men agreed with the statement that IU officials “should do more to protect students from harm.”The report and accompanying letter also read as though the University is attempting to shift responsibility for campus safety away from IU and onto students and society at large.Referencing the White House’s “It’s On Us” campaign that seeks to get students involved in preventing sexual violence in colleges and universities, McRobbie writes “fewer than 5 percent” of survey respondents said they thought prevention was “the sole responsibility of the University.”He also wrote in bold type that many IU students reported experiencing sexual violence “before arriving at IU.”We say this doesn’t absolve the University of its legal responsibility to keep students safe.Federal Title IX legislation requires colleges and universities to provide students with a safe learning environment free from “sex discrimination, sexual harassment and sexual violence,” according to knowyourix.org.IU is obviously doing a pretty awful job of meeting this obligation when 56.3 percent of undergraduate women and 85.8 percent of graduate women say the IU staff either did not help them at all, helped a little or could have helped them more when they reported an instance of sexual violence.We think it’s pathetic that it took a campus-wide survey to convince McRobbie that sexual violence and students not feeling safe while at IU are real problems.When almost 30 percent of women say their experiences negatively affected their academic life, the University is failing its students. And IU fails all of us if it fails to appropriately address sexual violence.We ask then, what exactly does IU plan to do?Because it’s not on us. It’s on McRobbie and the rest of the IU administration to ensure a safe learning environment for every student.Federal law agrees: it’s on them.',\n",

       "  'body': \"No matter what the data indicates, sexual assault is an “IU problem,” Leslie Fasone said.“But it’s also a cultural problem,” she said. Fasone is the lead administrator on the IU-Bloomington’s Community Attitudes and Experiences with Sexual Assault survey.Of the women who experienced sexual assault at IU by the end of the fall semester last year, 86 percent did not report the incident, according to data from IU’s first sexual assault climate survey, which was released Tuesday.“Unless somebody reports it, our hands are tied,” said Fasone, assistant dean for women’s and gender affairs. Among the undergraduate women who chose not to report sexual misconduct, 45 percent said they also felt it was not “serious enough to disclose to others.”They didn’t tell anyone.Data from the report sheds light on what is needed from IU: increased risk and prevention efforts. But until attitudes, beliefs and perceptions change, the administration’s role will only have so much bearing, Fasone said.“Students are invaluable to creating change,” Fasone said.* * *The 162-question online sexual assault survey first reached students’ emails in early November of last year.Six days later, students received the survey for a second time from Dean of Students Harold “Pete” Goldsmith. His subject line read, “It’s On Us: A serious issue that affects us all.” He wrote, “We need everyone’s response. It all starts with you.”A third and final email came from Goldsmith on Nov. 30, 2014, three days before the deadline for responses, with the subject line: “FINAL MESSAGE — A serious issue that affects us all.”Almost a year later, a total of 7,132 student responses were compiled into the administration’s final report, released Tuesday.This is the first sexual assault survey of its kind IU has conducted. It is a result of increased scrutiny of how universities’ administrations address sexual assault.On May 1, 2014, news broke that IU-Bloomington was under Title IX compliance review, meaning the United States Department of Education would look into the mishandling of campus sexual assault cases.An exact breakdown of the survey’s funding could not be provided by Fasone Tuesday. About $5,000 of a grant through the Women’s Philanthropy Council helped pay for data cleaning, while the Provost’s Office provided money for the 400 $50 Amazon gift cards, which were used to incentivise response.Fasone began working on a survey for IU before the compliance review began. She and Justin Garcia, a researcher at the Kinsey Institute, aimed to mirror the White House’s “Not Alone” survey, released in April of 2014, while drawing on other key components of analysis.Community Attitudes and Experiences with Sexual Assault full report* * *The survey is broken down into three sections: campus culture, experiences of sexual misconduct and attitudes, perceptions and beliefs. If respondents reported that they had experienced misconduct, they were given the option to elaborate.About 36 percent of female students — 431 individuals — who reported nonconsensual sexual activity went on to give more information about what had happened.The section on campus culture helps Fasone better understand the feelings students have toward the University, which she said will be helpful especially in prevention efforts.Questions about how drunkenness plays into consent were added to this section because it is an issue students bring up often, Fasone said.“That’s one of our biggest challenges working with some of our students, is to help them better understand alcohol and consent and what ‘impaired’ means,” she said.Among undergraduates, about 20 percent of men and 12 percent of women surveyed agreed that, “A woman who is drinking heavily can still give legal consent to sexual assault activity.”Additionally, alcohol or drug use or some combination thereof was present in as many as 83 percent of incidents reported.* * *Fasone said people who have experienced sexual assault may have been less likely to take the survey or continue answering questions about their experiences with nonconsensual sexual contact.All in all, the sample size was large enough and comprehensive enough to construct an authentic picture of sexual assault experiences and attitudes at IU.The sexual misconduct experiences section has provided information that, until now, IU could only estimate.The information is important because sexual assault is so underreported, she said.“To learn about that and say, ‘Here’s what’s actually happening,’ is incredibly important,” Fasone said. “It’s sobering.”* * *This Saturday a conference, open to college students across Indiana, will take place at IU-Purdue University Indianapolis. Next Tuesday there will be a panel discussion for students to listen and ask questions.Communication is also a big part of what prevention looks like to the administration. IU is working on framing their messages more consistently across prevention and education platforms.Fasone said one of the biggest reasons students do not tell anyone about a sexual assault incident is “fear of retaliation.”Providing information to people about where they can share their stories and where they can get connected to campus resources is a vital part of her job.While she’s already seen an increase in reporting through the Office of Student Ethics, the number of unreported incidents remains very high. IU plans to continue educating students on the sexual misconduct process, in an effort to hold students accountable.Fasone said she hopes these efforts, combined with student participation, can eventually change the culture.This story is part of ongoing reporting by the IDS Investigations staff.

       "  'body': 'On Monday, the front page of the IDS spread had three articles. Two were about rape. One was about racism, a hate crime. This time, I took it personally. I think it is time to say no more, but not in the way one would think.When awful things happen, we react by getting upset, up in arms or angry, but then we move on because we have to. I go to school, I work, I live my life and try to be the happiest that I can be, but that doesn’t leave that much time for anything else. There are jobs, lives and schoolwork to be done, and, ultimately, we are desensitized, perhaps thinking there is nothing we could do, or honestly, that it is just not our problem.Last weekend, MacArthur Genius Ai-Jen Poo was invited to campus to keynote at the Themester symposium on the 50th Anniversary of the Immigration Act and what she said resonated with me. Her message was to choose life and love over racism and hate. Think about that for a second, making the conscious choice of life and love.The reality of living on this campus is that rapes happen. We saw this in the Sexual Assault Climate Survey published Tuesday by President McRobbie. In that survey, 17 percent of our fellow undergrad women and 2 percent of undergraduate men responded, saying they had experienced nonconsensual attempted or completed sexual penetration.Moving forward, I argue that the critical distinction is that we avoid characterizing violence as simply an individual act or isolated event, but instead something we have to respond to holistically as a university, individual and community to create a net positive from something very negative.If every time we respond to violent events with — not outrage — life and love it makes our community safer and stronger. Imagine it as almost gently nudging IU towards the right path, making the world just a little bit better, one person at a time, one step at a time. Hopefully everyone has time for that in their lives. Stand up and choose: life and love.Eric LangowskiIU student',\n",

       "  'body': 'IU has released the findings of the first-ever climate survey on sexual assault conducted on the Bloomington campus.All students were invited to complete the comprehensive survey in November 2014 as part of IU’s commitment to effectively address the issue of sexual assault, according to an IU press release.IU Bloomington’s Community Attitudes and Experiences with Sexual Assault Survey asked students about their attitudes, perceptions and direct experiences with sexual assault, in addition to their opinions on the university resources and practices related to preventing and dealing with instances of sexual misconduct.More than 7,100 students, representing 17 percent of the IU-Bloomington student population, completed at least 50 percent of the survey and had their responses included in the findings released today. In all, more than 9,600 students completed some portion of the survey.“Many of the findings in this survey, while consistent with national trends on this challenging issue, were very sobering and speak to the need for even greater attention and resources to be focused on problems associated with sexual assault on college campuses,” IU President Michael McRobbie said in the release. “The information gathered through this survey has already been used to inform the University’s ongoing prevention, education and response efforts and to move us closer to the ultimate goal of eliminating sexual violence that affects our campus community — and we will further use this data to help drive our efforts moving forward.”Student participants provided a variety of demographic and personal information that will help guide IU’s efforts in this area, according to the release. About 16 percent of undergraduates and 20 percent of graduate students completed at least 50 percent of the survey. In nominal terms, 72 percent of the survey participants were undergraduates and 28 percent were graduate students. Sixty-two percent were women and 38 percent were men.In many ways, findings from the IU-Bloomington Community Attitudes and Experiences with Sexual Assault Survey were generally consistent with similar surveys conducted at other universities. The percentage of undergraduate women participants who reported experiencing attempted or completed non-consensual sexual penetration (17 percent) is somewhat below the national figure of 20 percent. The prevalence of alcohol use in instances of sexual misconduct and the fact that a majority of the women participants who experienced sexual misconduct did not report it to university officials are also consistent with findings from surveys conducted at other universities.One finding from the survey is the percentage of undergraduate students who experienced some form of non-consensual sexual contact — ranging from inappropriate touching to attempted or completed non-consensual sexual penetration — before coming to IU mirrors the percentage who indicated they have experienced similar types of misconduct at IU.Survey participants also were asked their views on resources available to them related to sexual assault, their general opinions on the safety of the Bloomington campus and community and the level of confidence they had in the University when it came to effectively preventing and dealing with sexual assault, according to the release.“The responses clearly reflect that many of our students have been confronted with sexual assault before arriving on campus,” said Leslie Fasone, assistant dean for women’s and gender affairs and the lead administrator on the climate survey, in the release. “Just as we have a broad responsibility to provide resources and information to our students regarding sexual assault, and to create a safe environment, it is also clear that these issues must be aggressively addressed in our secondary schools and communities.”The complete findings from the climate survey have been posted to the university’s sexual violence prevention website. The findings also will be shared with students and the broader campus community in the coming weeks through a series of meetings and events, and used to shape future programming and strategies related to sexual assault prevention, according to the release.Alyson Malinger',\n",

       "  'body': 'It’s been a tough semester to be a Hoosier.Between the deaths of three IU students, the removal of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity from campus, many other sexual assault cases on campus and at least one reported robbery, it appears there is an epidemic of crime culture here at IU.Now a potential hate crime could be added to that list.A 19-year-old IU student named Triceten Bickford was arrested on charges of strangulation, battery, minor possession and consumption of alcohol, intimidation and public intoxication for allegedly assaulting a Muslim woman at Sofra Café near Walnut Street on Saturday night.The IDS previously reported Bickford yelled the phrase “white power” before trying to strangle the woman, who was an immigrant from Turkey. His blood alcohol level was found to be more than twice the legal limit in Indiana.I am disgusted by Bickford’s actions. However, I am also upset at how such petulant Islamophobia could have developed within this person’s ethical code to begin with.In the United States, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment guarantees two things: freedom from religion and freedom for religion.The federal government cannot establish religious authority (granting citizens freedom from religion), yet individual citizens can practice their own religious beliefs (giving citizens freedom for religion).What the Establishment Clause does not establish is a right to physically attack others for their beliefs.I’m not sure if Bickford is religious or not, but I’d like him to try an exercise. It was first introduced in the book “To Kill a Mockingbird,” so if he has a high school reading level, he can hopefully understand it.A character named Atticus Finch said in the book that “you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.”I’d like you to try that, Mr. Bickford. Imagine you’re the Muslim woman at the café.Both as an immigrant, and as a practicing member of the Islamic faith, you’re constantly surrounded by strangers.You might not have much in common with the people around you. You might get looks from people on the street for wearing a head scarf. People might wonder why you speak in an unfamiliar accent.Regardless of your personal identity, you are still an American.You vote, you pay taxes and you send your children to school. You are a part of our nation’s tradition of welcoming all to be a part of our mythical melting pot.Yet you are targeted because you are different. Even though you have the most fundamental aspect of our nation in common with everyone around you — a commitment to America — you are assaulted for being different.“They’re making me out to be a monster. I’m just a normal person,” you were quoted as saying by WTHR.How dare you say this when your actions prove otherwise?ttfitzpa@indiana.edu@tfitzwrites',\n",

       "  'body': 'When it comes to sexual assault, no one’s rooting for the terror that affects one in four women who attend college, a number supported by a survey commissioned by the Association of American Universities in 2015.And no one’s in the corner for a crime that’s so underreported by men, the statistics are practically useless.No one wants this heinous act to increase in frequency on college campuses across the country.But the recent actions by a few organizations have led us to question if they intend to decrease the amount of sexual assault reports.As you may or may not be familiar with, the “Safe Campus Act of 2015” was introduced in Congress by Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., in late July. As cited by the bill, “if an institution of higher education which is subject to this part receives a covered allegation, along with written consent to proceed from the alleged victim, the institution shall report and refer the allegation to the law enforcement agency of the unit of local government with jurisdiction to respond to such allegations.”Essentially, the bill was formed to require police involvement in sexual assault crimes. According to the bill, a survivor may notify their institution if they don’t want the crime to be reported to the police. However, if a survivor does this, their school may not implement any punishments against the accused, meaning no suspensions and no expulsions, according to section 163.2.B of the bill.What this bill does is tie the hands of universities from helping survivors with the red tape of legislation that would, in theory, increase reports of rape to law enforcement.And what’s even more unnerving is the support this bill has gained from national Greek organizations.NYmag.com reported that Senator Trent Lott, R-Miss., would begin lobbying for the Safe Campus Act after being hired by a coalition made up of the North-American Interfraternity Conference, National Panhellenic Conference, Alpha Tau Omega, Sigma Nu and Kappa Alpha Order.The Huffington Post reported that the North-American Interfraternity Conference, which represents 74 men’s fraternities, deleted it’s web page advocating the Safe Campus Act on Monday.While it’s unfair to claim these organizations would blatantly want to increase unreported rapes and protect its members, — many of whom are the alleged perpetrators in campus sexual assault cases — it’s impossible to ignore the implications of this bill and the money these groups have thrown at it. Lott and a group of lobbyists have accumulated about $140,000 from this coalition.And before you believe the rhetoric the Safe Campus Act would increase reports by survivors to the police, and thus result in more convictions, you might want to look at the raw data.According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, 32 percent of rapes are not reported to law enforcement — not surprising. But only 7 percent of these reports lead to an arrest. Three percent were sent to a prosecutor, 2 percent ended in a felony conviction and only 2 percent of rapists spent a day in jail.It’s possible that reporting more assaults will increase the conviction rate, but the shocking results that 98 percent of rapists walk free isn’t convincing the 68 percent of non-reporting survivors to speak up.It’s perceived by many advocacy groups that a “chilling effect” would occur on campuses across the country if this bill were to be introduced; survivors would be less inclined to come forward with allegations to colleges and universities if there are more hoops to jump through.“We don’t force victims of other crimes to interact with police and file reports and initiate a criminal justice investigation,” Kristen Houser, chief public affairs officer for the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape, told the Huffington Post in regards to reports with universities.Whatever motives these organizations have for supporting this bill, it’s imperative to understand it doesn’t support survivors but allows the accused the right of protection.We’ve done enough harm to survivors on our campuses. This bill is the last thing they need.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Crowds of students taking their clothes off in Dunn Meadow were encouraged rather than disciplined Wednesday night.They were participating in the Nearly Naked Mile, an IU Homecoming tradition in its eighth year. Students clad in almost no clothing wore LED lights and ran from Dunn Meadow, past Showalter Fountain and finished at the Sample Gates.“It’s a really simple idea,” said Mike Mann, director of alumni programs for the IU Alumni Association. “It’s only a mile, it’s nothing serious and it’s not timed, so that makes it easy for students to have fun with it.”But the participants were running for a greater purpose as well, Mann said. To register for the event, students must have donated either $10 or two items of clothing. These donations all go to United Way of Monroe County.“We teamed up with IU for a clothes drive, and it eventually turned into the Nearly Naked Mile,” said Darcie Lowe, resource development assistant director for United Way of Monroe County. “The more fun an event is and the more people that are around, the easier it is to get the word out about the actual work you’re doing.”United Way serves as an umbrella organization that raises funds for 25 member agencies in the community, Lowe said. All clothing donations from the run are given to the Salvation Army, and monetary funds are filtered back into the community through organizations like the American Red Cross and Hoosier Hills Food Bank.The run raised $2,528 last year and had about 2,500 participants, Mann said. Similar numbers were expected this year.“It became a bucket list item with the Office of First Year Experiences, and that’s when we saw an upturn in popularity,” Mann said.The event also featured a PizzaX truck, the band 800 lb Gorilla and tables from Culture of Care, Safe Sisters, Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault, and the Union Board. Students started stripping down and warming up about an hour before the 8:15 p.m. start time.“The race just seemed like a good way to let loose and shed some clothes,” race participant Emily Smitheram said. “It’s a really creative way to raise money, and it’s so much cooler than just standing on some street corner and canning.”Smitheram and two friends were dressed in spandex shorts, bras and colorful hats.“We knew we could have a great time coming up with funny outfits for it,” Bailey Swan, another runner, said. “It’s totally just a no-judgement zone, and that makes it fun.”The idea for the event was originally borrowed from the University of Missouri. After seeing the success the school had experienced, the IU Alumni Association thought a similar event would be a good way to get students more involved in homecoming week.“I think it really creates a sense of unity for everyone who comes out,” said Ryan Thompson, publicity and social media chair for the homecoming committee.As more runners started preparing for the race, freshman Luma Khabbaz, a representative for United Way, spoke to the crowd.“We hope you have a great time,” Khabbaz said. “But we hope you remember why you’re here, too.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Large red banners are hanging on fraternity houses all over campus. “Join MARS 4 a safer IU,” reads the banner at Phi Gamma Delta. The one at Phi Sigma Kappa reads “Honk if U support SACS,” referring to IU’s Sexual Assault Crisis Services.The banners are the centerpieces of the BannerUp campaign organized by Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault, an organization within the Interfraternity Council. The first banner was hung at the Beta Sigma Psi house Oct. 2, and new banners continue to be added to fraternities each day.“We thought this would be a really easy, simple thing that would raise a lot of awareness with not a lot of cost or complexity,” said Jesse Scheinman, vice president of membership development for IFC and the overseer of the MARS program. “It’s something very feasible that creates a positive impact.”MARS worked with Safe Sisters, a similar organization within the Panhellenic Association, SACS and Culture of Care to develop the campaign.“We collaborated heavily with MARS with the banners, and we definitely encouraged them with the project,” said Bella Shu, vice president of personal development for the PHA and the overseer of Safe Sisters. “I think it really shows unity among all Greek members fighting for a safer community at large on campus.”Both MARS and Safe Sisters are recently developed organizations. Safe Sisters has existed for five years and began with 30 to 40 members. The MARS program in particular was in need of better organization and a clearer mission within the last few years, Scheinman said.“When I got started on the IFC, there was no roster for MARS, no bigger themes tied in, just two speakers per semester,” Scheinman said. “I saw the need for a better education process and better leadership.”MARS now has 231 members and admission standards for the organization are high, Scheinman said. Safe Sisters has also seen an increase in recent membership, with 117 new members being trained this weekend, Shu said.“I think the banner campaign has really helped with that and is really effective itself,” said Joshua Shalen, president of Sigma Alpha Mu and a member of MARS. “It’s a great opportunity for us to show the University and the community what our stance is, and it’s making every fraternity more conscious of its decisions and actions.”Recent events within the Greek community have made its organizations even more aware of this. Alpha Tau Omega was asked by MARS to remove its banner after the fraternity was shut down due to the release of a sexually explicit video involving many of its members.“Things like that make it very easy to get discouraged, but that’s not what’s going to happen,” Scheinman said. “We’re going to use these events to work harder, and it doesn’t mean that we won’t come back even stronger.”Making sure organizations like MARS and Safe Sisters are truly upholding high standards is a big priority, Scheinman said. Mandatory training sessions for both organizations are typically four hours long. A session run by Safe Sisters this week is being monitored by SACS to gain a sense of their organization’s efficacy, Shu said.“I really do think this project is effective and creates a cool visual reminder,” said Karis Neufeld, co-president of Raising Awareness in Sexual Encounters, a student division of SACS. “The front of every Greek house is making this big statement right out there in everyone’s faces.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'A lot of people have been wondering how to address the problem this country has with gun violence on college campuses. It’s undeniable that something must be done, but the conversation remains stagnant on the issue of guns as protection versus guns as problems. To absolutely no one’s surprise, Texas has sided with the pro-gun campaign.Texas will enact the “campus carry” law that allows people with weapons licenses to bring concealed firearms into any campus facility Aug. 1, 2016. This bill will go into effect on the 50th anniversary of University of Texas’ campus massacre, where Charles Joseph Whitman locked himself in a university tower and fired on students below. From this tower, he killed 16 students and wounded more than 30 others.This campus carry law isn’t particularly new or revolutionary. Colorado, Wisconsin, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon and Utah already allow concealed weapons on their campuses.What is unexpected is the reaction from some of the students at the University of Texas. Some students have planned a Campus Dildo Carry protest, where students come to class with vibrators, dildos and other phallic objects hanging from their backpacks.The purpose of the movement is draw attention to the ridiculous double standard of desensitization to violence and oversensitivity to sexuality.UT student Jessica Jin, an organizer of the event, called into question the set of ethics that is stricter on penis-shaped objects than guns. “The state of Texas has decided that it is not at all obnoxious to allow deadly concealed weapons in classrooms, however it does have strict rules about free sexual expression, to protect your innocence,” she wrote on Facebook.I have to admire the humorous protest style that not only calls attention to the student body’s discontent about policies that directly affect their safety, but also highlight the ridiculous set of ethics.The demonization of sexuality and glorification of violence that is frequently depicted in the media takes on real life consequences with policies like this. It is a common argument for pro-gun activists that having more guns will prevent massacres from happening because it will increase victims’ abilities to protect themselves. The problem with this is the culture of danger it creates. When anyone could have a gun, it doesn’t make everyone else feel safe. It escalates paranoia.One professor at UT has already resigned out of fear for his own safety. More than 280 professors have signed a petition claiming the campus carry law was a “direct assault on our free speech rights.”The University of Texas System Chancellor William McRaven, a former Navy SEAL, and one of the biggest opponents of this law, gives the best answer for why more guns doesn’t equal a safer environment. Drawing on his own experience, he says people who aren’t trained to handle a hostile environment will not react predictably when being shot at.But Navy SEALs and campus massacres can’t stop Texas from allowing concealed weapons on campus. Perhaps the only response left is a protest that can recognize the backwards set of priorities that is willing to see more harm in phallic plastic than it does in guns.jordrile@indiana.edu@riledupids',\n",

       "  'body': 'A new mobile app recently emerged, intending to provide users with a safer way to walk home alone at night, and its popularity is growing.The so-called Companion app was created by five students at the University of Michigan, allowing users’ friends to “virtually” walk them home at night by tracking their journey with GPS.As a young woman who has experienced feeling unsafe walking home alone at night, I found this little app quite intriguing.Whether I’m coming home late from campus or coming back from a night out with friends, walking alone can be nerve-wracking, to put it nicely.The app was originally created for college students who often walk alone at night, though we all know we ought to avoid it.The user can send out requests to different friends or companions, which hyperlinks the companion to a web page with a map showing the user walking to their destination.Users can press an “I am nervous” button, signaling to their companions that they are beginning to feel unsafe, or immediately call the police.But if they fall, stray off path, have their headphones pulled out of their phone or start running, the app detects this and asks the user if they’re OK.If the user does not confirm within 15 seconds, the phone will project loud noises to scare off animals or attackers.At first, this app seems like a fantastic way for students to get home safely and even simply feel safer while doing it.But how does this app set itself apart from other methods of protection like talking to a friend on the phone or carrying mace?Does this app actually make the situation safer or is it a roundabout way of ignoring the root of the problem with violence and sexual assault on college campuses?It seems like another example of our society not stopping the problem at the root.Though the Companion app could make students feel secure, our priority should be to make the environment on and off campus safer in the first place.The app reminded me of a nail polish, also developed by college students, which would change color if it comes in contact with a date-rape drug.The invention sparked heavy criticism because it could end up fueling victim blaming by putting responsibility on the woman to protect herself.The nail polish was well intentioned, but distracts us from real solutions to the problem: ending sexual assault in the first place.Is the Companion app doing the same thing by ignoring the root of the problem?I can’t ever see myself using this app. But it does seem a bit more thought through than a date rape drug-detecting nail polish.However, it certainly doesn’t solve the underlying problem nor does it act as a preventative measure against sexual assault.It could at least make students feel more secure walking alone at night.nrowthor@indiana.edu@nrowthornIU',\n",

       "  'body': 'The IU chapter of Alpha Tau Omega has already been shut down following the release of a sexually explicit video on Twitter Wednesday evening, The letters on the front of the house have been removed. Now, the young men living inside the house have no idea whether they will be allowed to stay.On Saturday afternoon, at least one person had a suggestion for where else they could go. A white sheet of paper was taped to the front door of the former ATO house. It was an advertisement for an apartment.“2 BR 2 Bath Available Now,” the advertisement read.The fraternity made national news in 1992 when it was kicked off campus after a freshman pledge was hospitalized with a nearly fatal .48 blood alcohol content. Last April, ATO president Tommy Paslaski told the Indiana Daily Student he was working to improve the reputation of the house. Now he has no comment.In the wake of the chapter’s closing, there are many questions left unanswered about what will happen next. University and criminal investigations are not complete. The possibility of the fraternity’s return to IU is unknown.Another question: what will become of the house where all of these incidents took place?The house is not owned by the national chapter of the fraternity or IU. It is owned by Delta Alpha of ATO, Inc., the board of alumni directors and housing corporation for the IU chapter of ATO. The decision of whether to evict the students currently living in the house lies with them.“We don’t understand yet which direction we’re going in regards to the house,” said Kent Miller, president of the board of directors, Saturday. “We have been having board meetings to discuss this very matter, and as of right now, we feel it is a little premature to be making that decision.”All chapter activities must cease, according to a statement released by the ATO national office Thursday.The closing of the fraternity chapter was in response to the leaked video specifically depicting an initiated member of the fraternity performing a sex act upon a hired exotic dancer in the presence of about half of the fraternity’s 140 members.“We have no idea who leaked it,” IU Spokesperson Mark Land said.By Thursday morning, fliers had been placed in front of nearly every seat in Ballantine Hall Room 013. The fliers read “BAN ATO” and listed the Twitter account where the video had been initially posted. The video and the account have since been removed.“As we began our investigation, the national office was doing the same thing,” Land said. “They essentially have the authority to step in and pull a fraternity whenever they want.”The IU investigation, separate from the ATO investigation, is ongoing and run by the Office of Student Life and Learning and the Office of Student Ethics, Assistant Dean of Students Steve Veldkamp said. The investigation is now focused on whether the actions of those involved in the incident are violations of the student code of conduct, Land said.“There cannot be an investigation of the fraternity because there is no fraternity now,” Land said.Though the ATO investigation concluded that the student performing the sexual act was a 21-year-old initiated member, hazing activities are still being considered in the IU investigation, Veldkamp said.“Given ATO’s track record, the campus, headquarters and even the rest of the fraternities and sororities not only condemn their actions but are making a statement that this is not acceptable Hoosier behavior,” Veldkamp said.The University stood by the decision from the nationals of ATO on Friday afternoon. The large Greek letters on the front of the house were taken down as former fraternity brothers watched.The sign in the yard bearing Alpha Tau Omega’s name was covered by a tarp, then later replaced by a large wooden box shielding the sign. After the letters were gone, students in the house hung an ATO flag from an upper window.The rest of the greek community at IU has taken steps to remove themselves from the circumstances surrounding ATO. The Interfraternity Council’s website has removed the page for ATO.“The Indiana Fraternity and Sorority Community is extremely disappointed by the behaviors exhibited by the former Alpha Tau Omega chapter,” a statement from the Indiana Fraternity and Sorority Community said. “It is our duty to be leaders and not only educate our members, but work to solve our most pressing problems.”Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault, an organization affiliated with the IFC, has spent the last week organizing their BannerUp campaign, meant to raise awareness of IU’s sexual assault initiatives. This campaign included large banners hung on fraternity chapter houses that read “real men respect women” and other variations within the theme of respect.ATO was a member of MARS, and its banner for the campaign has since been removed.“The events surrounding the now former chapter of Alpha Tau Omega are extremely unfortunate, embarrassing and are completely counter to the values of MARS,” Jesse Scheinman, who oversees the MARS program, said.On Saturday night, students driving around campus leaned out their windows, yelling “ATO party tonight!” But the house was silent.',\n",

       "  'body': 'If there’s one thing on everyone’s mind after Alpha Tau Omega’s atrocious video and its subsequent suspension, it’s that there’s a serious need for change on this campus.If you’re a hermit who hasn’t glanced at any form of news or social media, you’re in for a surprise. The University suspended IU’s ATO chapter, and the national ATO office revoked its charter after a video surfaced of a confirmed member performing a sexual act on an exotic dancer in front of almost half the fraternity’s members.No one’s arguing that this isn’t a serious situation and if they are they’re probably the type of person who attends an event like the one ATO has now become infamous for.But the reaction from our University is just a little too late, and we’d be seriously surprised if IU were able to turn this problem around.In fact, if you talked to some students on this campus a good number would tell you they aren’t surprised this happened, and at ATO no less.Hazing is bad enough and it’s no stranger to IU’s greek system, but it’s a wonder why the administration — and its critics for that matter — don’t call it what it really is.Any type of sexual act that involves persuasion, peer pressure or cohesion is deemed sexual assault.ATO passed hazing by a long shot with this video.And if our school’s administration thinks this is an isolated incident or the result of a “few bad apples,” they’ve got another thing coming.ATO received more than its fair share of warnings to get it together.The greek organization made national headlines in 1992 after forcing pledges to drink copious amounts of alcohol to induce vomiting. This hazing landed a sophomore in the hospital with an almost deadly .48 blood alcohol content. The pledge luckily survived.We thought they would learn their lesson after that train wreck but, unfortunately, ATO doesn’t take second chances seriously.The Editorial Board has come to an impasse, where we have to do something we absolutely hate to get the point across: use a cliché.Fool us once, shame on you. Fool us twice, shame on us. IU is partly at fault for letting an organization get to this level of recklessness and maltreatment.A report of sexual assault was filed in 2013. Speculations about a “Ménage Tau” party ATO plays host to every year — where “body shots, threesomes and much more magic follows” — were printed in 2013 by brobible.com.Reports of sexual assault, battery, alcohol violations and even a man falling off the three-story house have plagued the fraternity since its temporary suspension in 1992.The time for an ATO redemption has come and gone. But the rest of this school still has a fighting chance.If we want to learn anything from these events, it’s that inaction from our administration or action that comes too late isn’t going to cut it.You want to fix this, IU? Start by holding every single person present during the filming of that video responsible.',\n",

       "  'body': 'They walked in silence.The marchers went down Kirkwood Avenue as pedestrians and bystanders watched. Some turned to those next to them asking, “what are they doing?” or “what do their signs say?”But as the procession passed, most onlookers were silent.Gathered together at their final destination, the marchers stood together in an uneven circle. Finally, after a few moments they broke their silence, speaking out about abuse and assault but also survival, healing and solidarity.Members of the IU and Bloomington communities gathered Thursday for the annual Take Back the Night event, which raises awareness about sexual assault and domestic violence issues. The event was organized by the IU Feminist Student Association.“We really wanted to create a space where all sorts of different people could come together, share their stories,” said Savannah Lynch, FSA director of internal affairs. “The goal is to make it a safe, healing environment, so that people could feel supported, especially because survivors are so often denied social support.”The event began in Dunn Meadow with table displays from organizations on and off campus that work with sexual assault advocacy, counseling or related issues.The event culminated in a silent march to the Monroe County Courthouse in downtown Bloomington, followed by an opportunity for survivors or other people to voice their experiences or feelings about sexual assault, domestic violence or related issues.“I think the silent march is really powerful because it is a time for us to reflect on ourselves and our experiences and to really give some time to think about how we’re feeling and to be honest with yourself about how you’re feeling,” Lynch said. “It’s really hard to ignore or invalidate your own feelings when you’re silent and everyone around you is silent.”Lynch said the silence also serves to show solidarity with survivors of sexual violence who remain silent and honors people who have experienced sexual violence and then commit suicide.“I know very few survivors who haven’t considered it at some point,” Lynch said. “I feel like it’s a very good opportunity for us to think about that in a constructive, reverent way.”Lynch is a rape survivor and said she finds the services of the Sexual Assault Crisis Service within Counseling and Psychological Services to be one of the best resources on campus for people who experience sexual assault or violence.SACS offers free counseling for any person dealing with sexual assault, and has a Sexual Assault Crisis Service line available 24 hours a day, every day, according to its website“We want to be a presence to show support for survivors, but also for changing the culture,” Debbie Melloan, counselor at SACS, said.Lynch said Middle Way House is a valuable resource for anyone experiencing sexual assault or violence. Middle Way House will send people along with survivors to the hospital to ensure they are treated well by staff and police officers, Lynch said. They also offer a range of other services such as transitional housing for victims of abuse and legal advocacy.The Crimson CORPS is an IU organization that provides counseling from CAPS-trained peers.This option may be more comfortable than a professional counselor for some students, said Emma Sullivan, a task team leader for Crimson Corps. Representatives from Crimson Corps came to the gathering at Dunn Meadow for the first time.“We heard about the awesome cause and were invited to join, and we thought it would be a great cause to show our support for sexual assault awareness,” Sullivan said.The event concluded with the forum for discussion and expression.“We have our voices invalidated a lot, more often than not,” Lynch said. “You’d be surprised how unsympathetic people are when you say you’ve been raped. So, it’s really nice to have a physical gathering of people around you who will say to your face, ‘what happened to you isn’t OK, and we believe you,’ to support your healing process. It’s really powerful.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The neon “OPEN” sign above the door of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity’s house was abruptly turned off late Wednesday night.The IU chapter of the fraternity was suspended by IU Wednesday, Oct. 7, and then revoked and closed by the Alpha Tau Omega national office Thursday, Oct. 8. These disciplinary actions came in response to credible video evidence of a 21-year-old member of the fraternity performing a sex act in front of other chapter members.“The video is highly offensive and is antithetical to the values of Alpha Tau Omega,” said Wynn Smiley, chief executive officer for Alpha Tau Omega’s national office, in a statement.According to the statement, the investigation conducted by the national fraternity found the sexual act seen in the video was performed by an initiated member of ATO, not a pledge, and about half of the chapter’s approximated 140 members were present. The women in the video were exotic dancers hired by one of the fraternity members, the statement said.Though the fraternity member was an initiated member, hazing is still a factor to consider in the university’s investigation, Steve Veldkamp, assistant dean of students, said. The IU Police Department has also begun an active case to investigate harassment charges, Lt. Munroe of IUPD said.The investigation that led the ATO national office to revoke the IU chapter was run separately from the investigation conducted by the university. The national office\\'s decision is fully supported by the university, IU spokesperson Mark Land said.“As we began our investigation, the national office was doing the same thing,” Land said. “They essentially have the authority to step in and pull out a fraternity whenever they want.”The closing of the chapter is immediately effective and means all chapter activities must cease. The national fraternity will continue to work with the University on the investigation, the ATO national statement said.“The national ATO office has closed the ATO chapter in Bloomington as a fraternity,” Land said. “It no longer exists.\"A crowd of ATO fraternity brothers watched as their greek letters were taken off the house and a tarp was used to cover the letters on a concrete sign at the house Thursday afternoon.This is not the first time the IU chapter of ATO has run into trouble. In April, the Indiana Daily Student ran a piece about the fraternity’s troubled past. In “Holding up a house,” then-ATO President Tommy Paslaski said he was working to repair the reputation of the house.According to the story, the IU chapter made national news in 1992. At an initiation party, a freshman and his pledge brothers were forced to drink whiskey and wine from a funnel while blindfolded until they threw up. He ended up hospitalized in a coma, with a nearly fatal .48 blood alcohol content. He survived, but the fraternity was kicked off campus.The University does not own the house that previously housed the chapter and therefore cannot make the decision on whether or not the ATO members will have to vacate the house on Third Street.“We cannot force anybody out of that house,” Land said.The house is owned by Delta Alpha of ATO, Inc., the board of directors and housing corporation of the IU chapter of Alpha Tau Omega.“We don’t understand yet which direction we’re going in regards to the house,\" Kent Miller, president of the board of directors, said. \"We have been having board meetings to discuss this very matter, and as of right now, we feel it is a little premature to be making that decision.\"Because the fraternity has been closed, the university\\'s investigation is now focused on whether the actions of individuals involved in the incident are violations of the student code of conduct, Land said.“There cannot be an investigation of the fraternity because there is no fraternity now,” Land said.The investigation is ongoing and is being led by the Office of Student Life and Learning and the Office of Student Ethics. “The video was clearly an insight into the beliefs and attitudes of the former chapter,” Veldkamp said. “Given ATO’s track record, the campus, headquarters and even the rest of the fraternities and sororities not only condemn their actions but are making a statement that this is not acceptable Hoosier behavior.”This statement was echoed by the rest of IU’s Greek organizations. “The Indiana Fraternity and Sorority Community is extremely disappointed by the behaviors exhibited by the former Alpha Tau Omega chapter,” a statement from the Indiana Fraternity and Sorority Community said. “It is our duty to be leaders and not only educate our members, but work to solve our most pressing problems.”The statement was signed by the Interfraternity Council, the National Pan-Hellenic Council, the Multicultural Greek Council and the Panhellenic Association.“We as IFC do not condone sexual misconduct, and are working closely with the university on this matter,” Brian Singer, vice president of communications for the IU Interfraternity Council, said.Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault released a statement regarding the alleged actions of the chapter as well. Many fraternities on IU’s campus, including the former ATO, are members of MARS. MARS has spent the last week organizing their BannerUp campaign, meant to raise awareness of sexual assault initiatives at IU. This campaign included large banners hung on fraternity chapter houses. The banner on the ATO house has been taken down.“The events surrounding the now former chapter of Alpha Tau Omega are extremely unfortunate, embarrassing and are completely counter to the values of MARS,” Jesse Scheinman, who oversees the MARS program, said. “But rather than get completely discouraged by the events, we are only going to use them to further the fight against sexual assault and violence, hazing and any other conduct that degrades human decency.”',\n",

For male victims, however, there can be additional barriers to being believed and getting justice that female victims don’t face.Jade Hatt, now 21, faced a six-month jail term for engaging in sexual intercourse with an 11-year-old boy she was babysitting in November 2014 in the United Kingdom.But her sentence was suspended because Judge Tim Mousley felt, as he told Hatt, “it was quite clear he was a mature 11-year-old and you were an immature 20-year-old, so that narrows the arithmetic age gap between you.”Testimony from the boy’s father that his son had enjoyed the experience and “in many ways sees it as a notch on his belt” also played a role in the judge’s decision.Unfortunately, Mousley’s misguided viewpoint on the rape of an 11-year-old boy is far too commonplace.This view is symptomatic of a society that sees sexual conquest as appropriate and desirable male behavior and interprets female-on-male rape through that framework.While women and girls who are raped are often victim-blamed and thought to have wanted or caused the sexual violence perpetrated against them, men and boys are sometimes not viewed as victims at all but rather as sexual heroes.The opposite of the archetype of the sexually passive female waiting to be conquered is the sexually aggressive, uncontrollably sex-crazed male looking to score with any and every woman possible.This is the misguided notion of masculinity behind the 11-year-old rape victim’s father’s assertion that his son was “sex mad” and the boy enjoyed the illegal sexual encounter. According to the Guardian, prosecutor Hannah Squire said the boy said, “it was wrong.”The father of the rape victim claims his son was “totally unaffected by” the experience.But according to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, “men who have early sexual experiences with adults report problems in various areas at a much higher rate than those who do not.”Some of these problems include post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, substance abuse and engaging in risk-taking behavior.Another difficulty facing sexually abused men is the unwillingness of our society to accept that men can be the victims of sexual assault and rape. But according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, one in six men is sexually abused before reaching adulthood.Let’s be clear: what happened to this child was rape.Had this been a case of a 20-year-old man raping an 11-year-old girl, how many of us would suggest that the encounter was simply a notch in the girl’s belt?The patriarchal division of men and women into clearly delineated but artificial categories of sexual aggressor and sexual submissive does not admit the possibility of a female sexual assailant or sexual predator.Instead, men and boys who are sexually assaulted or raped by women are encouraged to view the assault as their own sexual conquest of their assailant, rather than being allowed to see themselves as victims of sexual crimes.When rape happens to a boy or a man, particularly by a female assailant, we need to recognize it for what it is: a serious, damaging crime.woodsmj@indiana.edu@miriamjwoods',\n",

       "  'body': 'Last year the White House announced the creation of the Task Force to Protect Students From Sexual Assault in an effort to reduce cases of sexual assault on college campuses.The task force created many measures aimed at reducing sexual assault, which included “Not Alone,” a comprehensive website, www.notalone.gov, with resources for survivors of assault.A public awareness campaign called “It’s On Us,” which features celebrities and politicians appearing on-camera with information about sexual assault, was also established.But how effective are these measures at accomplishing our goals of ending sexual assault on our college campuses?At IU, these efforts might not be amounting to much. The Indiana Daily Student has reported seven rapes on or near campus since the academic year began. As one of the PSAs on the “It’s On Us” website puts it, “just one rape is one too many.”I think one of the biggest issues with the task force is there’s simply not enough publicity about it. I was unaware of the task force, its mission and resources until I came across news articles of the president announcing the initiative.Those articles were uploaded more than a year ago.That is unfortunate, because the task force has done an outstanding job. The information on www.notalone.gov is easily accessible. People can download a comprehensive report of the task force’s findings and locate any and all data relevant to sexual assault. The report also includes resources about how sexual assault can be prevented and what proper steps universities should take in handling sexual assault cases.Yet it took some Googling for me to find the website to begin with.I think publicity and media partnerships between the “Not Alone” website and sexual assault crisis services on all campuses — not just Bloomington’s — could result in a greater number of people becoming aware of what resources exist in regards to sexual assault.Another issue is the series of PSAs “It’s On Us” produced don’t clearly connect the group with the “Not Alone” website.While the “Not Alone” website has links to the PSAs, the PSAs don’t include links to the “Not Alone” website. Instead, they provide a link to two different webpages: www.itsonus.org and www.whitehouse.gov/1is2Many.This is particularly troublesome, as the whole goal of the “It’s On Us” campaign is to provide the public with information about sexual assault. The PSAs should at least mention the “Not Alone” website.While I applaud the federal government for taking sexual assault seriously, I argue it needs to do more to coordinate its media resources successfully.That way, “It’s On Us” can be a reality for everyone.ttfitzpa@indiana.edu@tfitzwrites',\n",

       "  'body': 'In the horror film genre, there are many complaints I can make about the stereotypes used: killing people of color early, the lone virginal survivor, every character’s undying interest to check the strange noise coming from the basement/woods/under the bed.But I’m sick to death of the blood-and-guts industry using rape for fear mongering.I made a challenge to watch 31 horror films in 31 days last October — I know, I had a lot of time on my hands. You could say I’m an expert on this topic of discourse.I decided to try this challenge again this year with a new playlist of movies to watch and settled down Tuesday night to watch a classic, “The Evil Dead.”Between the bad acting and tremendous amount of fake blood, there is a scene in which trees sexually assault a female character.A woman, searching for a perpetrator she swears she saw looking through her window, enters the woods. Minutes later, her clothes are torn off and she’s pinned by twigs in the forest. Branches assault her in a such a sexual manner that there’s no possible way of mistaking this scene for what it truly is — pseudo rape via possessed trees.I like to brag that I have a strong stomach for films like “Saw” and “Human Centipede,” but this scene made me squirm.It’s quite possible that as a woman, I’m able to put myself in situations of assault more easily than I can imagine I’ll become victim to a Chucky doll or “The Purge.”But these scenes touch on more than just the fear of being assaulted.The purpose of horror is exploitation of irrational fears like spiritual beings, clowns, serial killers or premature death, just to name a few.But rape for women is an everyday horror. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, 1 in 6 women in the United States will experience sexual assault. How many of us will experience a poltergeist?And the 1981 classic “The Evil Dead” isn’t the first or the last horror flick to abuse rape as a plot point.“Splice,” “Incubus,” “Straw Dogs,” “The Hills Have Eyes,” Rob Zombie’s “The Devil’s Rejects” and the director’s cut of his “Halloween” remake all contain brutal scenes of sexual assault.And if you think it’s just gory horror films you’d never watch, the trope entered television a while ago. All four seasons of “American Horror Story,” which has a TV-MA rating, include some type of sexual violence against women.There’s even a sub-category of rape-revenge in the gore genre. “Last House on the Left,” “I Spit on Your Grave,” “Girls Against Boys,” “American Mary,” and “Jennifer’s Body” involve vengeance-ridden plots against a victim’s attacker.While I’m all for cruel people getting what’s coming to them as film narratives, using rape as a defining characteristic for female characters is pretty messed up.During the summer, I wrote a column about why movies and pieces of media can’t claim to be feminist.I’m not asking whether or not your favorite slasher movies are woman-friendly or pass the Bechdel test. But the use of this trope could pose dangers for those who watch these movies.Sexual assault, even if demonic branches commit it, draws on vivid and brutal imagery in horror films.A scene of assault in any movie can trigger survivors, but there’s something insidious about depicting desensitized rape for the purpose of instigating fear.If you feel these scenes are something to avoid, I don’t blame you. I’m fed up with it myself.Horror fans shouldn’t be subject to sexual violence if they don’t want to be, and there are plenty of supporters on the web who’ve listed scary movies without the shock value of rape.Sometimes, we don’t need to be reminded of the horrific experience women are subject to every day.maehogan@indiana.edu@madisonhogan',\n",

       "  'body': 'How many IU students are victims of sexual violence each year?That’s one of the questions the recently released Annual Security Report attempts to answer.The report is prepared each year by the IU Police Department in partial fulfillment of federal requirements under the 1990 Clery Act.The Clery Act requires all colleges and universities receiving federal funding to disclose crime statistics on and around campus, to take steps to ensure campus safety and to inform the affected public of crimes that occur on and around campus.Though the original legislation was passed in 1990, the Clery Act was revised and expanded in 2013 with the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.In order to protect the privacy of victims, campus crime reports include only dates of crime reports, dates on which crimes occurred and the general locations at which crimes took place.The text messages, emails and automated phone calls you receive any time a robbery, mugging, rape or other crime is reported on or near campus fulfill part of the federal Clery Act requirements.The Editorial Board has some questions about the categories and definitions used in the 2015 Annual Security Report, particularly about the changes in the categories of crimes for which statistics are provided, including crimes of sexual violence, between 2013 and 2014.For example, while the 2012 and 2013 statistics include instances of reported “Sex Offenses, Forcible” including “Rape, Sodomy, Sexual Assault with an Object, Fondling” and two categories of “Sex Offenses, Non Forcible,” or incest and statutory rape, the 2014 statistics break these categories down and remove sodomy and sexual assault with an object.The 2014 categories of sexual violence for which statistics are provided are rape, fondling, incest and statutory rape.How are readers of the report supposed to be able to compare 2014 statistics with those of earlier years, given that the reported categories have shifted so dramatically?If someone unfamiliar with reading statistics didn’t notice the change, they might assume sexual crimes have gone down, given that the rape category of 2014 is significantly smaller than the “Sexual Offenses, Forcible” category of 2013.But if one were to combine all the sexual assault categories of 2014 to replicate the 2013 category, the numbers have significantly increased.This might be caused by an increase of reporting these crimes, but the data makes it seem like sexual assault is on the decline.We wonder if the change in categories has anything to do with the Title IX compliance investigation the federal government opened regarding IU in spring 2014.Title IX is federal legislation that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. Among other areas, it includes protections against sexual harassment and sexual violence in educational institutions.On May 1, 2014, IU responded to the investigation by the U.S. Department of Education with an official statement that claims there were, at that time, “no complaints against IU-Bloomington that would have triggered an investigation” and that the purpose of the investigation was simply to “determine areas for improvement under Title IX.”This Editorial Board questions how much the University actually wants public input on IU’s handling of issues of sexual violence on campus.The Annual Security Report claims a policy discussion on the new university sexual misconduct policy and procedures took place on an unspecified date sometime during the past year and this discussion was open to the entire university community.How many people in the IU community, though, actually knew about the discussion before it took place?We wonder why this and many of the other initiatives outlined in the report were not better advertised by the current administration.Does IU actually want to have campus-wide discussions about sexual violence, or is the administration just trying to present an appearance of compliance with federal requirements?This Editorial Board encourages all members of the IU community to read the Annual Security Report and to familiarize themselves with their rights under Title IX and the Clery Act.Even if IU doesn’t want to have a campus-wide conversation about sexual violence with us, we can — and should — still have that conversation amongst ourselves as a community.',\n",

       "  'body': 'With faces masked by black bandanas, the students and supporters marched down Kirkwood Avenue chanting, “Whatever we wear and wherever we go, yes means yes and no means no.”Students Against State Violence rallied Thursday night, beginning in Dunn Meadow, in the organization’s second Demonstration against Patriarchal Assault this school year.“Fight the Patriarchy” was chalked on sidewalks, as organizers distributed black bandanas and chant cheat sheets reading, “ Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Sexist cops have got to go!”Protesters took turns before the march sharing their personal experiences as victims of sexual assault.Sophomore Leo Mohlke, a self-described pacifist, represented his own organization, Hoosiers Against Sexual Assault, at the rally. In stark contrast with most of the protesters present, Mohlke advocated for seeking better relationships with IU administration in tackling the issue of rape on campus.“Sexual assault is a huge problem on campuses, particularly IU because it’s a huge party school,” Mohlke said.By his own calculations, one in four women are victims of sexual assault on college campuses. That statistic is what drove Mohlke to seek change. He showed up to the Students Against State Violence demonstration to help spread his desire to work with administrators.Speaking up first at the demonstration’s designated speak-out time, Mohlke called for increased lighting around campus and a discussion between students and the IU Police Department.The latest Students Against State Violence demonstration came following two reported instances of rape — one in McNutt Quad and the other at an off-campus Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity recruitment event.No arrests have been made in either case, and Students Against State Violence sees this as a “failure to bring about justice by IU and the Bloomington police, as well as the IUPD,” according to the organization’s Facebook page.Despite the suspect’s having not been a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, Students Against State Violence demanded fraternity members be held accountable for their actions.In the organization’s first Demonstration Against Patriarchal Assault, demonstrators marched down Kirkwood Avenue, stopping traffic and throwing flares on the patio of the Upstairs Bar and the roof of Kilroys on Kirkwood.Thursday’s march closely reflected that. Despite Mohlke’s pacifist caution at the beginning of the march, demonstrators carried mace and flares.“Some of us just want to be angry,” protesters shouted in response to Mohlke’s calls for resolve.Windy conditions prevented supporters from releasing the mace, but a flare was let loose just outside Kilroys on Kirkwood and also at the intersection of Sixth and Washington Streets.The march, led with a poster reading “IU Doesn’t Care,” attracted attention and interaction from bystanders on the street.Frustrated by the lack of results from prior protests, Gabriella Cleyre related the treatment of racial minorities to that of female victims of sexual assault.“I wonder if people think about the ways that these issues aren’t separate or there’s not intersections between the ways that people are marginalized or have power taken away from them because of gender or have power taken away because of race,” Cleyre said. “It’s important to connect the anger that people feel about police for creating climate where stuff can just happen all the time.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'A year after filing a lawsuit against her producer for sexual abuse and rape, pop star Kesha’s musical career is at a standstill.The “Warrior” singer claims in a lawsuit the abuse began when she signed with Lukasz Gottwald, known as Dr. Luke, when she was 18.Kesha is currently signed to Gottwald’s Kemosabe Records, meaning she cannot work until the lawsuit is resolved, according to Salon.com.After Kesha filed the lawsuit against Gottwald in October 2014, he retaliated with a defamation suit and breach of contract, according to Rolling Stone.Though Kesha’s reputation as a wacky party girl precedes her, we cannot help but examine the repercussions she received for coming forward with her abuse.Kesha has not released any new music since her feature with Pitbull’s “Timber” in 2013However, Gottwald has not faced any repercussions.The hashtag, #FreedomForKesha began trending on Twitter, where supporters demanded the songstress to be freed from her contractOne supporter tweeted, “Kesha was sexually assaulted for a decade by her producer. She comes forward and now she can’t make music. #FreedomForKesha.”Not only could this discourage other rape survivors to come forward, but it also highlights the disparities between how society treats the victim versus the accused.Kesha’s battle continues as she pleads with a New York judge to grant her a temporary injunction allowing her to continue her work before it reaches the “point of no return.”“I cannot work with this monster,” Kesha wrote in the affidavit.In the past, the music industry hasn’t been too friendly to Kesha. Billboard circulated a poll via Google Docs, asking industry executives if they believed Kesha or Gottwald.In January 2014, Kesha also entered rehab to seek treatment for an eating disorder her mother claimed Gottwald triggered, according to People Magazine.Apparently our society finds it difficult believing the victims of rape.New York Magazine published a piece about Bill Cosby, who has been accused of sexual assault by 46 women, in July.Cosby told some of those women that no one would believe them, so they should not bother to speak up.It took decades for their stories to finally be told and for many to come forward.Yet Cosby has not been charged of any crimes, and many people call the allegations against “The Cosby Show” star into question.By perpetuating the idea that rape victims are lying or by telling them no one will listen to them, we are only encouraging them to remain silent.It took Kesha 10 years after her abuse began before she gained the courage to speak up about the abuse from her producer.She battled an eating disorder, went through therapy and now she cannot make music again until the lawsuits are settled.We know we have a problem when rape victims face heavier scrutiny and backlash than their rapists.It is Gottwald’s career, not Kesha’s, that should be on the line.nrowthor@indiana.edu@nrowthornIU',\n",

No closing because work has to be done on the building. No seasonal slowdowns. We are there literally all the time and, while we make extensive use of volunteers, the state mandates that paid staff be on the premises at all times.”The organization is also required to only hire paid staff who have had adequate, state-approved training. This training is expensive, Strout said. And though the state requires the training, it does not supply the funds to pay for it.She explained that the nonprofit, a United Way agency, is responsible for raising more than 30 percent of its budget.“In such circumstances, the last thing we need to be doing is making payments on mortgages, which, even with favorable rates, ends up costing a lot in interest, money that could go toward services,” Strout said. “We have as a goal retiring the mortgage by the end of the year. Jesse’s gift is a great way to stimulate giving toward that end.”Strout said the money will go to retiring the mortgage on the organization’s New Wings facility, which opened as the Middle Way administrative headquarters in 2010.“There’s little substitute for celebrity power when you’re trying to get noticed and generate support for necessary work,” Strout said. “With Jesse we have the added benefit of his keen intelligence, sensitivity and wit. He’s not spouting memorized lines. He’s talking from the heart. He’s a terrific asset.”Eisenberg did not randomly select the nonprofit, which provided emergency shelter to 246 women and children in 2013, according to its website.He is close friends with Strout’s daughter, Anna Strout, who graduated from IU in 2000. Strout said Eisenberg has spent a good deal of time with her family and they have become close.After expressing an interest in Strout’s work, Eisenberg attended a Middle Way House Mission Tour. At the end, he surprised Strout with the donation offer.Though they are not currently in the midst of a major fundraising campaign, Strout said Middle Way will begin reaching out more to new donors in November.The upcoming campaign will also include what Strout described as a “special challenge” for IU students.Strout said she appreciates the sacrifice Eisenberg is making to help the organization.“Of course, I know Jesse, and our home has been a place where he can just be himself,” Strout said. “I’m very grateful that he’s willing to give up some of that peace, another shelter from the spotlight, to support Middle Way’s work on behalf of victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The alleged rape case involving Chicago Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane is becoming increasingly bizarre.Kane is accused of raping a woman he invited to his home for a private party Aug. 2. Kane has maintained his innocence, and a rape kit showed that his DNA was not found on the accuser anywhere below the waist.So why would this woman go straight to the hospital for an examination if she was not raped? She would have to know the exam results would prove her fallacies. Something is definitely off here.Matters only became stranger last week when the accuser’s attorney Thomas Eoannou had a press conference to announce that the rape kit was anonymously delivered to the victim’s mother’s doorstep. It supposedly had been tampered with.It was later revealed the rape kit was never delivered to the mother’s home and that the mother was involved in a hoax.Eoannou called another press conference to announce his withdrawal from the case.As more and more information is becoming available about the case, people are becoming quicker to judge one way or another.There is no point in sitting around speculating whether or not Kane sexually assaulted a woman, because as of late, it seems like no one will ever know for sure what transpired that night. The only people who know what happened behind closed doors are Kane and his accuser.At this point, the only way we would ever know if Kane assaulted the woman or not is if he himself came out and said, “I sexually assaulted that woman.”Somehow, I do not see that happening anytime soon.So why are people so quick to decide this woman is just looking for a payout or that Kane is just another perverted celebrity?As a Blackhawks fan, I could still never imagine myself victim shaming this woman without really knowing the whole story.Supporting Kane through this is one thing, but accusing a woman of lying about sexual assault is completely different.While we should not automatically assume Kane is guilty, we should also not completely rule out the possibility that he is capable of something like this, as many Blackhawks fans already have.With the derogatory comments I have seen online about this woman, it is no wonder many sexual assault victims never come forward.According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, 68 percent of sexual assaults are never reported to law enforcement and 98 percent of rapists will never be sent to prison.People who are quick to judge this woman are contributing to rape culture, regardless of whether Kane committed the crime or not.As a society, we cannot afford to continue victim shaming and brushing off rape cases as if these crimes never happen.Because rape does happen. Every 107 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted, according to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network.And it will continue until the issue is looked at as a serious crime and victims are taken seriously.tatadams@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The IU Student Association chose freshman interns for the semester this past Sunday.The 21 selected students were each assigned to work with a senior member of the administration and they will work with their mentor on whatever work the senior member is pursuing, said Daniel Niersbach, director of the freshman internship\\r\\nprogram.Iman Mahoui is a freshman intern assigned to work with Jessica Chiang, the chief of policy. Mahoui said he wants to work on issues involving sexual assault on campus, and she said she feels especially excited to be part of IUSA because many members of the administration bring new talent.“It’s such a diverse and well-rounded program that does so many things and touches so many students,” Mahoui said. “It’s internal, it’s external. It works within IU, and it works with relations outside of IU. I really, really loved the idea of such an all-encompassing organization and to be able to be a part of that.”Niersbach said the internship provides the opportunity to work directly on policy and projects, as well as take an eight-week course.The course focuses on professional and leadership skills, such as compiling a résumé and different communication styles. It also offers opportunities to collaborate and talk to people from different parts of campus, such as Steve Veldkamp, assistant dean of students and director of Student Life and Learning.“Being able to be introduced to IUSA, especially as a freshman, you learn so much about campus,” Mahoui said. “When you’re representing a campus, you have to try to learn everything about it — about the students, about the departments, about the campus itself, the physical environment. It’s definitely a way for me to get closer to campus, to be more involved, learn new things, and I don’t think there’s any better time to do that than as a freshman, which is why the program is super unique.”The application process for becoming an intern had two parts. In the first part, interested freshmen sent in résumés and answered essay questions. Then, those who advanced participated in group interviews where they were asked questions, such as what area on campus they wanted to improve. They were also given a “case,” wherein the group worked together to solve a hypothetical problem.Niersbach said the point of the group setting was to see who could lead from the front by asking questions and directing others, as well as lead from the back by listening to what others say and analyzing their ideas.“We wanted to make sure they weren’t cutting other people out and weren’t afraid to step in,” Niersbach said. “Students who included teammates had the best\\r\\ninterviews.”Niersbach said another goal of the internship program is long-term growth for IUSA. Many current senior staff members, including Niersbach, were once interns, and freshman interns can potentially return to IUSA as members of future\\r\\nadministrations.However, Niersbach said, being a part of the internship program does not determine who can be involved with IUSA in the future and said IUSA members want anyone interested in making a difference on campus to get\\r\\ninvolved.“The resources and networks I was able to build have been probably one of the most rewarding parts of my freshman year because everyone in IUSA is driven to make campus better,” Niersbach said. “It inspired me to work harder and be better.”',\n",

However, it appears Gaga, a rape survivor, is genuinely using her fame for good.A portion of the proceeds from the song will be donated to organizations working with sexual assault survivors.Now that is a movement we can all get behind.But Mother Monster is not the first celebrity to fuel a social campaign.Celebrities draw a massive fan base to causes, through which they raise awareness and, hopefully, instigate change.President Obama’s sexual consent awareness campaign, “It’s On Us,” is backed by numerous stars.New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof and fellow journalist and spouse Sheryl WuDunn feature several actresses, such as Eva Mendes and Olivia Wilde, in their “Half the Sky” film supporting girls’ education.As a rape survivor at 19, Lady Gaga is an appropriate representative of this movement.She has been one of the most outspoken celebrities of her time, especially when it comes to social justice and LGBTQ rights.The music video depicts several scenes of rape, as well as the trauma and isolation that follow for survivors.While stressful to watch, it accurately represents the unfortunate realities of sexual assault on campus.One young woman in the video is attacked in her dorm.At IU, there have been four reported rapes this semester, three of which were in residence halls, according to the IU Police Department’s crime log.A rape in an off-campus apartment during a fraternity recruiting event was reported last Friday.Last week, a former IU student was charged with two counts of rape in two separate instances, one of which occurred at his fraternity, Delta Tau Delta.One in four female undergraduates in the U.S. reported they have been sexually assaulted, according to findings released by the Association of American Universities on Monday.The survey, one of the largest of its kind, also found almost three-fourths of survivors did not report the attack to law enforcement, even in the most serious assaults involving penetration.These numbers are alarming and frankly unacceptable.IU’s prevention service, Stop Sexual Violence, offers resources for prevention and incident reporting.The Health Center also offers Counseling and Psychological Services and a Sexual Assault Crisis Service.However, “Till It Happens to You” is changing the conversation from prevention to support.We can’t talk about sexual assault on campus if we ignore its detrimental aftermath. We cannot forget about the survivors.“The Hunting Ground” will be screened at 7 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 29, in Fine Arts 015. The event is free, but space is limited.The Editorial Board encourages all IU students and staff to attend the screening and to seek further information regarding rape and sexual assault on college campuses.',\n",

       "  'body': 'After last week’s Demonstration Against Patriarchal Assault rally, Students Against State Violence is now looking to challenge police violence in a planned demonstration for Andre Green, a teenager shot and killed by an Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer last month.The organization will meet at 7:30 p.m. at Sample Gates in a demonstration as a part of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, according to the Students Against State Violence Facebook page.A flier for the upcoming demonstration claims “Andre Green’s death was a blatant example of police brutality; one in an unending campaign of terror against poor people of color.”Students Against State Violence did not comment on its upcoming rally.Last week, amid the bright lights and music echoing outside the bars lining Kirkwood Avenue, Students Against State Violence blocked traffic in a march beginning at the Sample Gates to support changing rape culture at IU.Through bandanas covering their mouths, demonstrators chanted “Yes means yes, and no means no!”The organization’s Demonstration Against Patriarchial Assault came following recent reports of rape Aug. 29 behind Kilroy’s Dunkirk.In a call to action flier distributed at the demonstration, Students Against State Violence drew attention to the Aug. 29 incident in which an officer discovered the crime in progress while on regular patrols, according to an IU Police Department statement.The demonstration flier said, “A police officer witnessed the crime and did not arrest the assailant. He walked free. We absolutely will not stand for this any longer.”The same flier also cited an incident last spring in which a part-time IUPD officer was suspended on sexual assault charges within a residence hall.The protestors at the demonstration demanded the police officer involved in the Aug. 29 report be kept accountable and police patrols in dorms be stopped immediately.While IUPD Lt. Andy Stephenson said the department encourages people to voice their opinions, he said he believes some stances taken against IUPD are being made by those who do not fully understand IUPD’s process.“We take every report of sexual assault very seriously,” Stephenson said. “The legal system has a process, and, when you gather the facts and present our evidence, it’s not up to the police department to charge people with crimes. All we can do is present the facts and present the case to the prosecutor’s office.”Stephenson said the officer suspended last spring was a student living in a residence hall and the investigation was deferred to the Bloomington Police Department. The prosecutor’s office later determined there was not enough evidence to press criminal charges. It was the only incident Stephenson said he could think of involving IUPD.“I can tell you that the University and IUPD are not complicit in rape culture,” Stephenson said. “It’s something that we work very hard to prevent these types of things from happening.”Stephenson said the department works closely with other University offices such as OASIS, a drug and alcohol information center on campus, and Residential Programs and Services to spread the word that sexual assault crimes need to be reported.IUPD also offers rape aggression defense training twice a year and upon request to teach a women-only class on defense tactics to be used in an instance of assault. Stephenson said hundreds of women have taken the free 12-hour training class.“It’s a problem at every university in the county, and the police department cannot make a difference by themselves,” Stephenson said. “It takes a total community effort, and in this case I agree with those that voice their opinions because obviously all of the people need to work together to change the culture regarding the way sexual assault is viewed.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Representing former IU student John Phillip Enochs in a case involving two counts of rape, lawyer Katharine Liell said she believes there is evidence in the case not reported in the probable cause affidavit that “will change the minds of the public.”Liell is representing Enochs in partnership with attorney Amelia Lahn. Liell said only women will be on the defense team for Enochs’ case.“It is not by coincidence that a team of all women are representing him in the case,” Liell said. “He has a team of female warriors ready to go to bat for him.”The two alleged rapes were reported as separate incidents to the IU Police Department. One was reported as occurring at the Delta Zeta sorority house in fall 2013 and the other was reported as occurring in the Delta Tau Delta house in spring 2015, according to a Monroe County Court probable cause affidavit.Witness statements, victim identification, DNA results and video evidence gave IUPD probable cause to seek a warrant for Enochs’ arrest on two counts of rape, according to the IUPD statement.Enochs surrendered to the Monroe County Jail Friday, according to a statement from the IUPD.Liell said she is “clearly convinced” of Enochs’ innocence.“We are eager to tell his story in a court of law to test the women’s credibility,” Liell said.Enochs is facing one count of rape as a Level 3 felony and one count of rape as a Class B felony, according to a Monroe County Court case summary.Enochs first enrolled at IU in fall 2012 and his last semester was in spring 2015. Enochs hasn’t been enrolled in fall classes and has not graduated from IU, University spokesperson Mark Land said.Enochs was studying business and was a brother of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity at the time of the alleged rapes, Liell said.Delta Tau Delta fraternity was placed on a deferred suspension Sept. 1, effective through March 2016. The suspension is a result of an “environment conducive to endangering university students that resulted in a sexual assault,” according to IU’s Student Life and Learning’s disciplinary probation records.Delta Tau Delta fraternity Chief Operating Officer Jack Kreman said in an email that the fraternity’s headquarters office is “aware of a lawsuit filed involving its chapter at Indiana University,” and that the office is “working with its counsel to review the complaint.”Delta Tau Delta fraternity is also being placed under social restrictions through Jan. 1, 2016, according the disciplinary probation records.Assistant Dean of Students Steve Veldkamp said in an email, “The social sanctions are a result of organization being held responsible for creating an environment which led to sexual misconduct from a 2015 incident.”Enochs is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 10.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Rape culture has become a bit of a buzzword in recent months, but its growing usage in the media is a sign of a cultural revolution IU took part in last Thursday night.A student organization called Students Against State Violence spoke out with a Demonstration Against Patriarchal Assault rally, showing necessary public support against rape culture, which will hopefully spark legal recognition as well.Rape culture is described by Emilie Buchwald, author of “Transforming a Rape Culture,” as a “complex set of beliefs that encourage male sexual aggression and supports violence against women,” that also “condones physical and emotional terrorism against women as the norm.”This means that in our culture, men and women recognize the threat to women’s safety and think it to be normal, unchangeable and, most importantly, the responsibility of women.This is why women are questioned about what they were wearing when they are attacked. This is why it is drilled into our heads that we can never walk anywhere alone.This is why so many women keep feelings of guilt and blame when they are attacked, when the blame lies solely with the attacker, no matter what the woman was wearing, where she was or who she was with.This rally was in retaliation against a pervasive culture at IU, but, most specifically, it was timed to respond to a rape that took place behind Kilroy’s Dunnkirk on Kirkwood Aug. 29.According to the Indiana Daily Student, an officer found two people who appeared to be engaging in sexual activity, one of whom claimed the activity was non-consenual.No arrest was made, causing SASV to call the IU Police Department negligent, and its assault prevention program “lackluster” and “superficial.”IUPD Lt. Craig Monroe has said there is more to the case than the public knows, making it easy for us to jump to the wrong conclusions about what really happened that night.That might be true, but worse still is the recent allegation against an IUPD part-time officer — who has since resigned — who allegedly raped a student.SASV also called for the end of the program that allows IUPD cadets to live in the residence halls and police patrols in the dorms. SASV understandably sees it as yet another danger for women, instead of security.But the rally and this issue are much bigger than one crime.It simply reflects a changing attitude on this campus about the reality of sexual abuse.Every week there is a new report on campus. Students are most affected and frightened by these crimes, so now they’re speaking out.These ideas have been gaining traction as of late and not only with students.President Obama has launched an initiative called “It’s On Us” to try to combat rape culture on campuses.Congress is voting on a bill concerning campus assault.Though many advocacy groups condemn the bill, the fact that this very real problem is finally being considered at the federal level brings it to the attention of those who might enact legislation to aid victims and students at risk of sexual assault on campus.jordrile@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Members of the Graduate and Professional Student Government gathered for the general assembly’s first meeting at 3:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 11, in Hodge Hall.President Benjamin Verdi and other executives addressed the newly appointed or elected representatives, briefing them on procedures, recapping last year’s initiatives and introducing possible committees.A new committee for student health and wellness was created this year out of what used to be the student affairs committee. Verdi said part of the impetus for the creation of the new committee are the intentions of Anne Tinder, IU Student Association president, to devote resources toward improving mental health care, student health and wellness and overall campus safety.He said graduate students need to play a role in these initiatives.Skyler Hutto, vice president of GPSG, chairs the new committee and said he feels student mental health and overall wellness issues are newly identified, though not necessarily new, issues. He said graduate students have different needs when it comes to overall health and wellness.“One thing that I think we (graduate students) experience at a higher level is stress: academic stress, professional stress,” Hutto said. “A lot of us work and are students, so it’s just a different environment. We’re hoping to target some of our advocacy towards addressing those concerns for graduate students, but I think there would be a lot of spill over to benefit undergrads as well.”Verdi said another reason for the committee’s creation was last year’s initiative to change language in sexual assault alerts on campus, which he said seem to place blame on victims in the safety tips provided.The initiative met resistance, and Verdi said the new committee could deal with issues surrounding sexual assault. He said the committee for health and wellness can also work with other committees, such as the committees for diversity or benefits, to supplement their work.Other issues Verdi said he hopes GPSG will deal with pertain to sustainability. Last year the GPSG assembly passed the Omnibus Sustainability Resolution, which called for IU to list sustainability as a “grand challenge,” IU President Michael McRobbie to sign the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment by the end of this academic year and IU-Bloomington to expand solar power to one megawatt in two years’ time.Verdi also said he wants to revisit the idea of divestment from fossil fuels. GPSG previously pitched the idea to the IU Foundation, but he said the plan was rejected because representatives did not make an economic argument for why IU should divest from fossil fuels.This year, Verdi said he hopes GPSG can convince the IU Foundation to create a divested fund parallel to the foundation’s regular investment portfolio, with the hope it would show a higher return rate than the normal portfolio, since he said alternative energy companies are among the fastest growing.“We have to be able to tie financial benefit to environmental progress if we’re going to convince people on a wide scale to be able to get behind it,” Verdi said.Another issue brought up during the meeting was improving disability services on campus. Diversity officer Brittany Witherspoon brought up the topic when she introduced herself to the assembly. The issue was further discussed when the assembly broke out into committees.“Through observation, I realized that a lot of the disability-accessible things on campus aren’t actually working,” Witherspoon said. “I think it will be a really good idea to try to come up with some initiatives to get it to work or to improve our services in general.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Students Against State Violence wore all black and bandanas around their faces during their Demonstration Against Patriarchal Assault rally Thursday night.The group gathered in front of the Sample Gates for a soapbox-style forum on rape culture at IU and in Bloomington. They marched down Kirkwood Avenue in front of bars in response to a recent reported rape behind Kilroy’s Dunnkirk on August 29.The group’s flyer claimed an IU Police Department officer witnessed the crime but did not arrest the perpetrator, who walked free.“The investigation is ongoing, but it’s not as simple as one might think,” IUPD Lt. Craig Munroe said. “The underlying theme of this is consent — whether consent was given.”According to the police report, an officer came across the alleged victim and perpetrator in an alleyway. No arrests have been made at this time.“I understand the concern that people have, and, if you look at it and you don’t have all the facts, then it’s very easy to think something is amiss,” Munroe said. “I can tell you that not all the facts are out in the public yet because it is an ongoing investigation, and that’s probably what’s causing the confusion.”At 11 p.m. the rally blocked traffic in front of Kilroy’s on Kirkwood with protesters yelling “Yes means yes, no means no.”IU doctoral candidate Shadia Siliman joined the rally holding a handmade sign outside KOK. Siliman’s dissertation is on rape culture.“I’m alarmed by the rape culture at IU and I’m joining this group of people ready to do something about it,” Siliman said. “I’m invested in doing something about it.”The rally targeted the University’s “institutionalized complacency in and perpetuation of rape culture in Bloomington.” The group cited the University’s Title IX investigation, the dismissal of an IUPD officer and rapes that have already been reported this semester.The Department of Education’s compliance review began March 12, 2014. The DOE requested 33 different counts of documentation in relation to Title IX complaints, according to documents obtained by the Indiana Daily Student. The results of the investigation are still pending.IU sophomore Kristen Pimley stood in front of the crowd and spoke about her personal experiences with street harassment and sexual assault.“We need to fight back and not only teach women how to protect themselves but teach the people who do rape that this is not okay and it will not be tolerated and they will be punished,” Pimley said.There have been four reported rapes this semester, three of which occurred in residence halls, according to the IUPD’s daily crime log. The most recent were the alleged rapes of two minors during Labor Day weekend at McNutt Quad.“Indiana University has gone beyond being complicit to being aggressors in rape culture with their newest policy — police patrols in the dorms,” according to the rally flyer.The police cadet program in which part-time student officers live in residence halls is not new, Munroe said. The program has been in place for nearly 30 years.Last April, a part-time officer was accused and suspended on sexual assault charges against a student. The IUPD officer resigned.',\n",

       "  'body': 'With September being National Preparedness Month, the IU Notify system has recently expanded to include computer updates via a new Alertus emergency alert software.Alertus, which has the ability to post full-screen pop-up messages on any computer with software downloaded from IU Ware, has been implemented in the IU Notify system for only about a month.IU Notify is the system that IU uses to alert anyone on the current email and phone lists during an emergency situation.Emergency Management and Continuity Director Debbi Fletcher said the Alertus computer notification is “just one more tool in the toolbox,” of IU Notify’s current alert strategy, which includes various combinations of phone calls, texts, emails and social media alerts sent out among IU students and staff for different types of emergencies.Fletcher said the goal of this extra medium of communication was to reach students and staff that may have cell phones and other mobile devices put away during classes.“That’s one of the reasons we really pushed to get a system like that,” Fletcher said. “We knew there were places we just weren’t touching people. We could not get messages to them because they could not receive them.”Alertus was first tested last week when a gas leak on North Jordan Avenue near the Musical Arts Center prompted the IU Police Department to evacuate the area. While the Alertus updates were sent out to computers as planned, templates in the emergency notification system were left blank sending out the message: “IU Bloomington Update: A dangerous situation is occurring near (INSERT LOCATION). Stay away from the area. Follow official instruction.”Fletcher attributed this to human error while operating a new system.“In an emergency, you just don’t have time to think about it,” Fletcher said. “You need to be able to send it, which is why sometimes you’ll get things that will come up and the template will be messed up or somebody forgot to put the word in because somebody’s trying to do this under pressure.”Much of the IU Notify system, including some texts and emails, use a template format for emergency notifications so that dispatchers or emergency personnel can send alerts quickly when an action is required, such as evacuating a building or taking shelter.In the event of a crime alert — a no-action required update — templates are not used. These alerts typically instruct individuals to have a heightened sense of awareness after an incident that has already occurred, such as an armed robbery or sexual assault where any potential threat is under control.Fletcher said that these crime alerts typically only come through emails that are crafted specifically about an incident not using templates.A team of emergency personnel conducts a review typically within 24 hours of each emergency incident managed. This process has become more formal within the last year. It now requires forms to be filed and reviews the clarity and results of IU Notify mediums used.Fletcher said public input on IU Notify is collected once a year via surveys attached to annual tests of the system every March during IU Emergency Management and Continuity’s Operation Stormy Weather.Fletcher attributed varying arrival times of emails, texts and phone calls, along with some never being received, to cell phone providers and the sheer amount of people – some 63,000 in Bloomington — that must be alerted.She said emails could take five minutes to send, whereas the phone system loops repeatedly through all phone numbers provided to IU Notify if the call cannot be connected on the first try.“Usually we’ll end up canceling it and stopping whatever calls have not gone out if that’s the case, but that’s really a hardware issue,” Fletcher said. “Phone systems just cannot handle that kind of push of calls.”Fletcher added that word of mouth helps make up for some of these missed calls.Other responses Fletcher and her team commonly receive are that too many alert phone calls are sent out or that they are being sent at inconvenient times. Since switching to a new emergency notification system two years ago, called Rave, IU students and staff have the ability to change and add phone numbers for alerts and select notification settings for various IU campuses.The old system automatically sent alerts to information provided during enrollment or at the time a staff member began working at the University. The new system will continue to alert these places if settings have not been changed to ensure every person has a way of being contacted in the event of an emergency. These settings can be changed in the IU Notify app found at one.iu.edu.cl.PULL OUT: Other safety updates can be followed by means of the IU Emergency Management and Continuity Facebook page, campus Twitter accounts including @IUBloomington, and viaemergency.iu.edu.',\n",

The group focuses on artistic expression through poetry, art and music by creating and collaborating in Bloomington. The group is composing a female-fronted album titled “The Quiet Grrrl Music Collective.”Although the framework of the group originates from the 1990s third wave of feminism, Quiet Grrrl is not exclusively a feminist organization and speaks out against social injustices such as transphobia and sexual assault.Bloomington resident and non-binary transwoman Tom Williams sought out Quiet Grrrl to speak about trans rights and bring trans-misogyny to the forefront of feminist discussion.“I want to make trans-misogyny a focal point of what we’re trying to stop and work against,” Williams said.Unlike similar student organizations such as the FSA and Stop the Kyriarchy, Quiet Grrrls is not affiliated with IU and is open to Bloomington residents. They lack affiliation partially because the group does not align with all of IU’s ideals and policies — specifically, IU’s sexual assault policies, IU alumna and Quiet Grrrl co-founder Shelby Everett said.“It also opens it up to a more diverse demographic,” Everett said.The group plans to collaborate with IU’s student organizations that address sexual assault and other issues, including FSA’s Take Back the Night march.“Because we want to focus on multiple social injustices, we need more than one group or one person to speak out,” Everett said.',\n",

It can include physical, sexual, emotional, economic or psychological actions or threats of action intended to gain or maintain power and control over their partner.”When domestic or dating abuse is physical, it is usually, though not always, fairly easy to recognize. Most people already understand that physical violence in the context of an intimate relationship is unacceptable and wrong.But what about emotional and psychological abuse? These can be some of the most difficult types of abuse to recognize, but also some of the most damaging.What do emotional and psychological abuse actually look like?Since abuse is all about power and control, abusers will often try to isolate their victims. If your partner demands that you spend all of your time with him or her or prevents or discourages you from talking to or spending time with friends or family, you might be in an abusive relationship.Many emotionally and psychologically abusive behaviors can appear to be the result of one partner’s intense love for the other. But these behaviors actually stem from a desire to maintain control of an intimate partner.Examples of this are extreme jealousy, a refusal to allow the victim to have friends of the opposite sex, unfounded accusations of cheating and demanding to know where the victim is and who she or he is with at all times.Abusers might insist they do these things out of love. But such extreme jealousy is a sign of insecurity, not love.Another abusive tactic is gas-lighting, or making you question your own perceptions of reality. The term comes from a 1938 play — a film version appeared in 1944 — in which a man drives his wife crazy by dimming the gas lights in their home and then denying that there had been any change.If your partner makes you feel that you can’t trust your own perceptions, you might be in an abusive relationship.Refusing to take responsibility for one’s own actions, behaviors or choices is a hallmark of abusive individuals. The same can be said of blaming victims for their abuse.There is no shame in being a victim of relationship abuse. The shame lies solely with the abuser.If you are being abused, please understand that it is not your fault. As much as your abuser might want you to believe otherwise, there is absolutely nothing you can do, say or change to make your partner stop abusing you. That has to be their choice.What you do have control of is whether or not to tolerate an abusive partner’s unacceptable behavior. And there is help available.Middle Way House in Bloomington offers a 24-hour crisis line, support groups, legal advocacy, emergency and transitional housing and numerous other services.The National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) is also available 24 hours a day and is anonymous and confidential.Relationships should make us feel happy and secure, not anxious and afraid. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help.woodsmj@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault’s IU chapter was founded in 2013. Today, the organization has 86 members committed to engaging and educating men about the issues of rape and sexual assault.“We realized there was a need for a comprehensive educational program about these important topics, and MARS not only focuses on the issues, but also on the solutions,” said Jesse Scheinman, vice president of membership development on the Interfraternity Council.In an effort to make the sexual assault discussions more focused this year, Scheinman said he hoped to use thematic speakers at their meetings.“With new members joining fraternities in the coming weeks, we’re hoping to emphasize these important topics in their new member education,” he said. “We plan to target freshmen and show that talking about these issues is an important aspect of joining the IU and greek communities.”Additionally, Scheinman said he hoped to work more with Safe Sisters, a Panhellenic group trained by the IU Health Center’s Sexual Assault Crisis Service, to serve as a resource for sisters on the issue of sexual assault and potentially plan a joint philanthropy event.“We want to create an organization that all Hoosiers can be proud of,” he said.Dan DeBard, president of Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, said 10 members of his fraternity are in MARS. He said these representatives bring information and training from MARS meetings to their chapter, making all members better able to respond in situations involving sexual assault.“It’s not only understanding what happens in the moment, but also learning what to do to prevent these incidents from happening in the first place,” DeBard said. “It’s time for the fraternity community to be part of the solution, and that starts with proper education.”Recently, a new chapter of MARS started at Purdue University. Scheinman said he helped the president of Purdue’s Phi Kappa Psi fraternity set up the organizational structure of MARS at Purdue.“I have been in really early talks about partnering for service and philanthropy, but right now we are primarily focused on MARS at IU,” he said. “With that being said, we are certainly in contact with them, as well as MARS at Northwestern.”Scheinman said all those wanting to join MARS must fill out an application on their website, www.marsprogram.org. They are also required to participate in at least 75 percent of programming and to attend one four-hour training session taught by SACS professionals that covers in-depth greek and alcohol-related issues.“We expect skepticism at the beginning, but members will quickly realize this is completely different than what they learned in other sexual assault programming,” Scheinman said. “We use real-life scenarios during training and don’t sugar coat the material.”Scheinman said new members have the opportunity to take on numerous leadership roles in MARS once they complete training.“From marketing to web design to philanthropy planning to discussion leaders, we’re always looking for more people to help spread our message around campus,” Scheinman said.Sophomore exercise science student and Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity member Caeb Onken said he joined MARS last semester after Bill Phan, director of MARS and former president of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, spoke about the organization and its mission to the new members.“As an orientation leader this summer, I always made sure to mention MARS and all the work we are doing for the IU community,” Onken said. “I feel distinguished to be part of such an incredible organization.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'In a courtroom in Concord, New Hampshire, last week a 16-year-old girl burst into tears while being cross-examined about a rape she said occurred at the hands of a fellow student in May 2014, when she was only 15.St. Paul’s School, a private preparatory school in Concord, is one of the most prestigious and selective schools in the country.It has produced 13 U.S. ambassadors, a Nobel Prize winner, three Pulitzer Prize winners and numerous other famous, important and powerful individuals.It is also where the girl, whose name has not been released to the public because she is a minor, reports that she was raped by then-senior Owen Labrie, now 19.According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, there are approximately 293,000 victims of sexual assault in the United States each year. 68 percent of sexual assaults are never reported to police.One might ask, if rape and sexual assault are so common — occurring on average once every 107 seconds in the U.S. alone — why don’t more victims come forward and report what happened to them?The St. Paul’s School case provides a perfect example of why many victims choose to remain silent.Law enforcement, the court system and the media all contribute to the retraumatization of victims of sexual assault and abuse if victims do decide to come forward.Law enforcement officers often fail to take such reports seriously, and sometimes engage in victim-blaming, such as suggesting that a victim should not have been in a certain place or dressed in a certain way.Both law enforcement and the courts are woefully undereducated about sexual assault, rape, abuse and the ways in which trauma can cause a victim’s “inconsistencies” about what occurred.This is exactly what happened to the girl in the New Hampshire courtroom, who apologized to the defense attorney who questioned her.“I’m sorry I was cloudy because I was traumatized,” she said.Victims of crimes such as rape and abuse should never have to apologize for the trauma that was inflicted on them.Yet they are too often accused of having made up “false allegations” because their stories might appear inconsistent or because they did not report an assault immediately.Just being in a courtroom with her rapist or abuser can make a victim feel anxious, afraid and unsafe.Imagine trying to recall details from a year ago or more while feeling absolute terror at being in the same room as your attacker.In the St. Paul’s School trial, unfair jury selection appears stacked in favor of Labrie, rather than the girl who reported that he raped her.The jury consists of 11 men and only three women.Even the way such cases are reported in the media can reinforce a victim’s perception that no one believes her and that the whole world is against her.Labrie is an “alleged rapist,” and the 16-year-old is an “alleged victim.”So-called “men’s rights activists” love to suggest that there is an epidemic of “false accusations of rape,” as though women just wake up and, in a fit of boredom or vindictiveness, decide to accuse innocent men of rape.The ordeal endured by real victims, however, shows how patently absurd this idea is.No one would run that kind of gauntlet just for fun or spite.When a woman comes forward about a rape, she is being incredibly brave.The least we can do is take her seriously.With one in six women in the U.S. experiencing sexual assault in her lifetime, chances are that many of your friends and classmates have stories like this.Unfortunately, chances also are that they have remained silent because they know they won’t be believed.woodsmj@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Ke$ha has become the butt of many jokes.She makes catchy songs about people who don’t have it together, and as such she is often a punch line.However, the butt of a joke still has basic rights.Ke$ha has accused her manager, Dr. Luke, of sexual, physical and emotional abuse.Dr. Luke has countered by saying she is attempting to extort him, and he said he is suing her.Billboard magazine evidently thought that was hilarious and sent a survey to top music executives asking them who they believed, the singer or the manager.The survey also covered other topics, like how Justin Bieber’s career would pan out in a few years and who were the biggest jerks in the industry.As with most cases of abuse, the details are tricky.Dr. Luke may not have known how he was affecting Ke$ha, or she misunderstood their dynamic.With no clear evidence, proving allegations of abuse becomes a mind-numbing game of “he said, she-said.”However, that does not mean it shouldn’t be taken seriously.What Billboard has done is effectively take the gravity away from the situation, and they have turned it into an inside joke among the people who are responsible for producing a large chunk of media that circulates today.Furthermore, there is an ever-increasing demand for transparency, and, whether or not transparency is readily available, the public will force companies to be honest.It is surprising that Billboard would have sent out a survey like this in a world where information is readily available and that they didn’t expect consequences. It speaks to a large and serious issue of hypocrisy within these companies.With as many female artists as there are right now declaring themselves feminist, wanting to fight for equal rights and to protect marginalized groups, it is ludicrous that those same artists should have to face insidious discrimination within an institution that wants to present itself as forward-thinking.And of course, there’s the ever-present problem of the lack of appreciation for situations of abuse and assault.Even if Ke$ha is fabricating her claims, and even if Dr. Luke’s claims of extortion are true, when someone speaks about abuse, we need to listen.To make light of the situation so publicly is to send a message to victims who are not famous — to women, children and men — who feel the only thing they will receive if they try to get away or reveal their abuser is humiliation — or worse, people will side with their abuser, and they will receive no help at all.We can laugh at a artists all we want, we can enjoy their music and we can make fun of it, but we can’t ignore when they try to publicize with a serious issue.Ke$ha has a platform to talk about recognizing and escaping abuse, and we need to give it to her.She deserves that.',\n",

       "  'body': 'We spend a lot of time hashing and rehashing the problems of rape culture and sexual assault on college campuses.To that end, IU groups have begun creating programs to enact serious change on campus. Within the past few years, IU fraternities signed a pledge saying they would make a renewed effort to educate people on rape and take steps to prevent it.However, there is another aspect of rape culture that is often ignored solely because it is so insidious it goes unnoticed. People still, for whatever reason, think sexual assault is funny.The Sigma Nu chapter at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, is now receiving backlash after a few fraternity members hung three signs over the balcony of an off-campus house reading, “Rowdy and fun, hope your baby girl is ready for a good time,” “Freshman daughter drop-off” and “Go ahead and drop Mom off too.”The largest problem I see is not so much a lack of understanding of what rape and assault are.Rather, there’s a willingness to joke about them, to take the gravity and seriousness away from the violence and thus undercut the experiences of the victim in order to justify problematic behavior.Moreover, it represents a serious problem surrounding the stigma of sexual assault — making light of sexual assault challenges the seriousness of the crime and tells victims the only outcome of reporting said crime is humiliation, not help.It is this aspect of the sexual assault debate that is often not discussed or recognized.These students at ODU clearly didn’t understand the violent message they were sending and how it could even go as far as to put another person in the way of serious harm.And I understand how they could have thought it was funny.Before I came to IU and really began discussing and understanding what rape culture is as well as the harm it can do, I thought similar jokes were funny as well.I would readily defend the victim of the crime, but I probably would have laughed if I had seen pictures of the ODU students’ signs.There seems to be a disconnect — not just on college campuses but across the board — between knowing what rape and sexual assault are and understanding their emotional, physical and psychological effects.If these students had understood the trauma victims experience, I highly doubt they would have hung the signs — or even had the idea in the first place.Rape can no longer be funny.The victims aren’t punch lines, and we especially need to start respecting spaces occupied by young women.These signs were directed at freshman girls — young girls cannot continue to feel unsafe in the spaces they have fought to have.If we want serious change, we need to start being serious.ewenning@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'When the student body presidents from six Indiana universities approached state Sen. Jim Merritt, R-31st District, in fall 2011, he wasn’t sure he could help them.The students, one of who represented IU, asked Merritt to author a bill that would give immunity to underage youth under the influence of alcohol when they call to receive medical help for a friend.“It took me about 30 days to think about authoring this bill or not, because we’re acknowledging that kids under 21 do drink alcohol,” Merritt said. “That was a big hurdle for me, but what I want is to make sure they make good decisions. I don’t want their last decision to be a bad one.”To encourage these good decisions, Merritt authored the Lifeline Law, which was originally passed in 2012. It states a person is immune from arrest or prosecution for certain alcohol offenses if the arrest is due to that person reporting a medical emergency.The law also grants certain levels of immunity to the person for whom help is called as well as anyone around who can provide information and fully cooperates with emergency responders.In the 2014 legislative session, the General Assembly passed an amendment to the bill that allows underage youth to call for help if they witness or experience sexual assault, if they witness a non-alcohol related crime or if they call for help in the instance of a non-alcohol related medical emergency, without fear of arrest or prosecution.Last week marked the beginning of the second year of the “Make Good Decisions” social media campaign.“This past fall we were able to send 6 million impressions out over social media,” Merritt said of last year’s campaign. “To think that we contacted 6 million kids, I really believe we had a positive impact.”Make Good Decisions is a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating youth about the effects of alcohol and the Lifeline Law.The campaign involves creating invisible domes around college campuses — including one in Bloomington — that send advertisements out onto various social media platforms like Facebook and Pandora.The organization tries to conduct the campaign, which costs around $30,000, twice a year.“I don’t want there to be a student or a young person in Indiana who doesn’t understand how alcohol affects their body or what to do in an alcohol-related medical situation,” said Dawn Finbloom, a woman involved with organizing the campaign.Finbloom lost her 18-year-old son, Brett, to alcohol poisoning in August 2012.Finbloom said she thinks many youths don’t really understand how alcohol affects their bodies. One Solo cup filled with hard alcohol is actually equal to 12 drinks, she explained.“I think that if there’s awareness, then they’re going to make the call,” Finbloom said, noting the group’s new Facebook page is a good way to raise awareness. “Everybody wants to do the right thing. Nobody wants to lose their friend.”Capt. Joe Qualters, of the Bloomington Police Department, said he’s happy the law encourages students to call for help.“The law didn’t really change how we do business because we’ve always been medical first and everything else secondary,” Qualters said. “For us, the notoriety that came with the law is the biggest benefit.”She had only been on campus for two days and everyone knew her — the girl who fell down the stairs. As the reporters called and the rumors spread, her parents tried to remember she was more than that.The students, one of who represented IU, asked Merritt to author a bill that would give immunity to underage youth under the influence of alcohol when they call to receive medical help for a friend.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Dozens of college students filed into the Indiana Memorial Union Whittenberger Auditorium on Friday to learn from the story of Rachael Fiege.“Rachael’s First Week” is a program designed to help high school seniors and college freshmen safely transition from high school to college, according to the program’s website.Angi Fiege, Rachael’s mom, created the program in an effort to prevent tragedy striking another family after tragedy struck her own.Angi dropped her freshman daughter, Rachael, off at IU on Aug. 21, 2013. Two days later, Rachael fell down basement stairs during a party, hitting her head.Rachael’s friends moved her to a couch and waited to call an ambulance until morning. They didn’t know her brain was bleeding and that she would die the next day.“Two years ago to the day, I dropped her off at IU in the fall and then two days later, she died,” Angi said. “The hardest thing I ever did was unpack her room after carefully putting everything in it.”She said that as students embark on this stage of their lives, accidents happen.“You’re suddenly grown up and you’re going to encounter a lot of things you’ve never seen,” she said.Rachael’s First Week travels to high schools and universities, addressing the dangers that college students may face — not only alcohol, but also drugs, sexual assault and mental illness.“Tonight we’re here to inform you. We’re here to educate you, because you’re going to have a lot of decisions to make in the next four years, and I want you to make the right ones. I want you to have every opportunity to make the right decisions,” said Jacob Capito, an emergency medicine resident at the IU School of Medicine.Capito, like the other speakers, stressed the importance of using your common sense and caring for your friends, because what happened to Rachael could happen to any college student, he said.“We were pretty similar,” he said of Rachael. “We both loved soccer. We both worked hard on and off the field. We both had aspiring careers to become medical workers. But what really hit hard is that I found that I could have been in her shoes. I could have been in her exact shoes eight years ago. And I had similar experiences, and so when I heard her story, I was like, ‘I’ve got to get involved.’”Capito then asked the audience how many of them thought they would make the call for help. Of those who replied, a vast majority said they thought they would make the call.“It’s easy to say right now, right here,” Capito responded, but added that only 10 percent of students would actually make the call.“We know that there’s a sense, when this happens, of being unsure,” he said. “What’s going to happen to us if we make that call? What’s going to happen to the victim if we make that call? Who’s going to get in trouble? And so tonight we’re going to tell you a little bit more about that, in hope that we can reverse what is the reality.”Jeremy Fiege, Rachael’s brother, stressed the important of the Lifeline Law.Broadly speaking, the Lifeline Law provides certain immunities to those, including those underage, who call for medical help in emergency situations.“If you are concerned about someone and you aren’t sure whether you’re protected or not or whether that person is protected or not, please, make the call,” Jeremy said. “Because the consequences of not acting are potentially catastrophic.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The IU Health Center organized “Sex, Drugs, and Rock ’n’ Roll” Friday at Showalter Fountain as a part of this year’s Welcome Week festivities.The IU Health Center’s Counseling and Psychological Services and Sexual Assault Crisis Service sponsored the event, which was geared toward educating students on how to party safely.Chris Meno, a CAPS psychologist and event organizer, said last year’s event brought in about 1,600 students and that organizers were hoping for 2,000 students to attend this year.Planning for “Sex, Drugs, and Rock ’n’ Roll” began in March.Each of the 38 organizations present at the event, including the IU Student Association, OASIS, Safe Sisters and Culture of Care, were required to incorporate an educational game based on sex, alcohol and drug use at college.“It’s not realistic to ask them not to drink and have sex,” Meno said. “We want them to learn skills to party safer, and that’s what the interactives teach.”Focused on an audience of mostly freshmen, activities were structured to teach students about the typical college party atmosphere.Various booths touched on topics like what is in “jungle juice”, how to count drinks and what a serving looks like in a solo cup.The Panhellenic Executive Council sponsored a booth with an activity based on the popular drinking game “flip cup”.This was the council’s first year being involved at “Sex, Drugs, and Rock ’n’ Roll.”Allie Dickmann, a junior on the Panhellenic Executive Council, said the council was drawn to the event to help bring awareness to issues of sexual assault.“We have so much potential as a student body to change what is happening,” Dickmann said. “And I think starting at a young age is helpful.”Meno said that “Sex, Drugs, and Rock ’n’ Roll” helps educate many freshmen at a formative time when they are first developing drinking patterns.“Freshmen come to campus with preconceived notions of what’s normal to be in college,” Meno said. “This is our opportunity ... so students can learn what’s actually healthy and appropriate at college versus what their cousin told them or what they saw on TV.”The event also provided information on what to do in a situation of distress, with booths focusing on the Indiana Lifeline Law, bystander intervention and how to use a free Blood Alcohol Content Level app.Freshman Lisa Moore said she that she felt the interactive activities were more informative than alternative teaching methods.“I figured out that the line on the solo cup actually means something,” Moore said. “I actually did learn things.”Students were offered a range of prizes based on the number of booths they visited throughout the event.Prizes included free snow cones and drawings for gift certificates to local restaurants, Little 500 tickets, a $100 T.I.S. College Bookstore gift card and an iPad Mini.Meno said one of the main reasons “Sex, Drugs, and Rock ’n’ Roll” is put on is so students can become familiar with the IU Health Center if they ever do have an issue with sexual assault, alcohol, drugs or safety.“We’re going to be the first ones on campus that they’re probably going to go to deal with that problem,” Meno said. “We want them to see our kind faces and get to know us so they can get to know us and get to feel comfortable using our wonderful Health Center services.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Graduate and Professional Student Government executive committee is poised to address sustainability and sexual assault this school year.“(Sustainability) is going to be at the forefront of what I want to do, from the committees I want to sit on around campus to the people I want to meet and the people I want to work with,” GPSG President Benjamin Verdi said.Last December, Brady Harman, former GPSG president, and Andrew Bredeson, former GPSG sustainability officer, met with Gary Stratten, IU Foundation vice president and chief investment officer; Dan Smith, IU Foundation president; Gary Anderson, IU Foundation investment committee chair; and the IU Foundation investment committee to urge the IU Foundation to divest from the top 200 fossil fuel companies.The IU Foundation, however, said its members base their investment decisions on a variety of considerations and do not use their investment decisions to make symbolic statements.“I don’t really think that, frankly, the student leaders that brought it forward really thought it through, because I don’t think there were enough financial and economic arguments made for why divestment is a good idea, and that’s exactly the arguments the IU Foundation want to hear,” Verdi said.Verdi said he plans to explore the idea of setting up a parallel fund and then divesting, rather than divesting immediately. He said the idea is to talk to donors who would donate if they knew their money was going toward sustainable projects and see if this new portfolio makes as much money as the original portfolio.“And so I’d like to spend as much of my energy as I can back at the table with the people that Brady Harman and Andrew Bredeson met with and sit on the same side of the table as them this time,” Verdi said.He said he also hopes to explore the idea of setting up a student conference, either IU-wide or Big Ten-wide, dedicated to sharing the best sustainability practices.Verdi said he also plans to address sexual assault.In April, GPSG representatives passed a resolution calling for changes in the rape alert emails sent by the IU Police Department.The resolution called for the removal of the phrase “rape by force,” as representatives said the phrase suggested there are different kinds — even different levels — of rape, as well as the replacement of the safety tips with gender-neutral bystander intervention tips.“However, they didn’t really change it in the way that we wanted,” Verdi said, adding that he plans to press for further changes.In addition to sustainability and sexual assault, he said he hoped to create new career-oriented programs.“I want us to focus a little more on the realities of what it means to be a graduate student here,” Verdi said.Although he said he wanted the new career-oriented programs to target all graduate students, he particularly wants them to target international students.“I don’t want there to be people who are here, who are graduate students, who could be served by us in some way, that maybe previously we’ve talked about, but haven’t explored,” Verdi said. “It’s an inclusive space, that’s the number one thing I want people to know ... You’re going to be totally represented by everything that we do.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Amid boos and cries of outrage, the curtain fell on the late-June production of “Guillaume Tell” at the Royal Opera House in London.Ordinarily a flashy production, full of feats of heroism and suspenseful peril, “Guillaume Tell’s” director included a depiction of violence far more visceral — and more disturbing — than those a chivalrous archer would execute: sexual assault.The presence of such a brutally realistic depiction of rape in the high art of opera catalyzed a cacophony of frustration, criticism and disgust.The intensity of the condemnation from the classical community denotes an undercurrent of anxiety about the translation of sexual assault to the operatic stage and places a spotlight on our conceptual weaknesses: Audiences cannot bear to witness an attack of this nature in such realistic arena.Rhetoric like “inexcusably nasty” and “dismally brutal,” as the scene was characterized by local reviewers, indicates encountering rape enacted by dynamic characters — with personality, history and humanity — is unpalatable.The presence of sexual assault in live performance introduces a new medium of consumption, one that doesn’t allow audiences to evade the crime’s actuality.Viewers have been exposed to sexual violence in all other modes, but the absence of a human encounter has thus far made the gritty unacceptability easy to escape.In an opera, when a gasping, crying woman struggles before other members of the human race, reality demands to be seen. And the outcry indicates the bitterness has struck its mark.Much of the criticism was fueled by disbelief “high art” like opera could include content so crass. In truth, the midst of a classical spectacle is the ideal environment in which to frame and expose the horrors of sexual assault.Operas transcend the boundaries of time and their accompanying cultural climates unlike other art forms. They are reproductions of ancient stories told across centuries and yet are portrayed by us in the midst of our own daily landscape.As we walk into the dawn of self-awareness and self-examination of the gender dynamics shaping our conceptions of each other, the vital message only an opera is equipped to convey is rape — like love, war, jealousy, murder, betrayal, ambition and destruction — is a tale as old as time.Opera breathes. Sexual assault committed on stage is unbearably repulsive because the characters involved bear undeniable resemblance to ourselves.Micaela Baranello of the New York Times wrote, “the problem with many of these scenes is that they generalize and make abstract an acutely painful and personal experience by co-opting individual trauma for symbolic currency.”She must have miscalculated such currency’s exchange rate, because the outrage with which the audience responded evidences everything but generalizations and abstractions.The scene was appalling, and the audience got far less than the benign allusions for which they bargained. They got something near reality in all its horror and nausea.Depictions of sexual assault in media are problematic when they become exactly what Baranello described: allusive, epithetical, glamorized plot features. Of these we must beware.But the Royal Opera house can measure its success in the decibels at which their patrons shrieked following “Guillaume Tell.”sbkissel@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': '1. The statute of limitations shouldn’t protect rapists.The unconfirmed guilt of Cosby aside, one of the positives of this blemish on American cultural history has been the dialogue ignited regarding the problematic nature of the statute of limitations in the United States.The statute of limitations is an old legal concept which exists to help restrict judicial proceedings to a reasonable time frame.The time frame may vary from state to state. In general, the maximum number of years is pretty minimal — 10 years in some states. This kind of legislation takes after a 1600s Britain version, when the discourse regarding rape and sexual assault probably didn’t come close to resembling today’s.What we do have today is a limitation of the limitations when it comes to heinous crimes. First degree murder is usually the sole exception to the statute of limitations. The alleged rape of 47 women apparently does not qualify as heinous even though there is no limitation on how long the effects from sexual violence may last.The statute of limitations mostly falls short in the way it disregards the role time plays in the aftermath of sexual violence. It isn’t uncommon for years to pass before a survivor of sexual violence realizes they have been raped — you can thank poor sex education for that — or decides to come forward and confront the rapist — you can thank slut-shaming and rape culture for that.A statute of limitations that does not qualify sexual crimes as heinous means many survivors don’t even get a fighting chance at bringing rapists to justice, permitting individuals responsible for abhorrent acts to continue their behaviors without limitation.2. Proving sexual violence in a court of law is difficult.Having an innocent-until-proven-guilty model of justice is a cornerstone of American freedom. Even in the case of sexual violence, this cannot be ignored.However, most sexually violent crimes are perpetrated behind closed doors in an intimate setting. Rarely is there documentation, and it more or less becomes one person’s word against another, which isn’t sufficient for a conviction.It is a complex insufficiency of our legal system. Perhaps a union of legal and humanitarian thinking and lobbyist pressure could change how sexual misconduct is handled in court to help the cases which aren’t inhibited by the statute of limitations.3. The response from the social court is reassuring, but it still is not enough and is too slow.While a court of law cannot touch Cosby given the current circumstances, the public reaction has been swift and appropriately severe.Cosby’s work is being pulled from the air left and right, while plans for future works — including a Netflix stand-up special — are dissolving into oblivion.There is a petition calling for Cosby’s star to be pulled from the Hollywood Walk of Fame and another demanding he be stripped of his Presidential Medal of Freedom, the most esteemed civilian honor.It is obviously positive to see apologists of Cosby’s declared behavior are dwindling, but it is still offensive how much outcry arrived only upon the information released regarding his 2005 Quaalude admission. The word of 47 women should have been more than sufficient.4. Sexual misconduct is not perpetrated exclusively by celebrities.A final note is a reminder about the media treatment of Cosby and the atrocities he is said to have committed.The media coverage is upholding an idea serial rape of this scale is newsworthy when the person is noteworthy. It makes sexual violence seem like it is an isolated occurrence perpetrated by men of power and influence.News outlets cannot report nationally about every rape and sexual assault because it is happening all the time, and not just from quirky, sweater-clad father figures. Rapists are teachers, coaches, fathers, sons and brothers. They are men and women. There are serial rapists and rapists who do not realize they rape.The 47 accounts against Cosby may and should seem outrageous and horrifying. Given the ease with which a person can get away with rape in our country, however, we cannot let this seem like an anomaly.',\n",

       "  'body': '“Welcome to College” will remain one of the highlights for IU student and cast member, Brianna Holt’s time as a college student.“I think it’s really cool to see how everyone starts out a little hesitant about the only thing,” Holt said. “By the end I’ve only heard that this is students favorite part of orientation. It was my favorite part of orientation when I was a freshman.”Holt is a junior double majoring in choral musical education and vocal performance while minoring in theatre. She plays the role of Lucy, who flirts with the main character Joe.“My favorite part of the whole thing is at the beginning,” Holt said. “We’re all singing ‘Welcome to College’ and it’s kind of cheesy and everyone’s like ‘okay this is lame.’ But as the show goes on, people start cracking out of their shells a little bit and by the end of the show everyone is laughing a lot and it’s great.”Although the musical is only a half hour long, cast members are still given the opportunity to show the depths of their characters because of the social situations presented, such as meeting new people or a house party with alcohol.The second song of the musical, “It’s Weird,” features three characters who meet in college and discuss their differences as an African American male, a bisexual woman and a Jewish man.“So it’s just kind of like the song about how they’re all really different but realize they can all be friends and it’s really not a big deal,” Holt said. “That’s one subject it goes into about accepting people, because when you get to college there’s so many different people from high school probably that you interacted with and so it’s a really cool topic about being ready to accept everybody.”Another song, called “I’m Not That Drunk,” discusses how to handle oneself or others in case of an alcohol-related incident.“It (the musical) is a very intentional and planned component of New Student Orientation,” Director of NSO, Melanie Payne, said in an email.Payne directs the orientation program, which involves determining which sessions and programs will be a part of NSO.Planning the musical has been a collaborative effort since 2008. The NSO began performing it after a student who worked with sexual assault awareness programming and happened to be an aspiring musical theatre writer approached the NSO team with the proposal to write a musical, Payne said.They have continued to purchase the rights to the musical each year and the writer works with them if it needs to be updated to keep the content relevant.The musical is unique to IU specifically with references to Welcome Week events and other IU traditions. While the musical is used as a fun break from evaluation tests and academic planning, it also provides a platform for discussing more serious ?matters.“At NSO, we have always addressed the issues that “Welcome to College” addresses and have done so in many ways,” Payne said. “We held focus groups of students, faculty and staff who work with safety, diversity, programming and student life, throughout the development, to make sure we were hitting the topics needed, and in a way students would respond to.”The impoprtance behind incoming freshman seeing the musical is the important isssues it portrays. Many incoming freshman have yet to experience living away from home and their families, Payne said. The musical provides an avenue to introduce potentially problematic situations.“It showcases scenario and decisions that students are often faced with — alcohol, safety, bystander intervention, involvement, diversity and inclusion — in a way that isn’t preachy or boring,” Payne said.Hearing these topics musicially makes understanding them easier and prepares the audience members if they encounter any of the situations depicted.“I think that it gives students another light into ways that people can still feel,” Holt said. “When the rape scene happens, I think we’ve gotten everyone so attached to the show by then that they realize that this is actually kind of serious and we’re actually trying to tell them something through this musical.”The conversations after the musical are important, Payne said. NSO helps students process the musical and put themselves into the situations viewed with a “what would I do and how would I make my decisions along the way?” mentality, Payne said.While the musical discusses many different themes, the most prevalent is sexual assault — focusing on consent, alcohol and its impact on judgment.Diversity, as well as self identity, friendships and bystander intervention are other major themes discussed in the musical.“It conveys students grappling with these issues in some real ways,” Payne said. “Showing that you can choose not to drink and still have a good time with friends and possible scenarios/consequences if you do so irresponsibly, it depicts friends confronting friends, people getting to know others and appreciating our similarities and ?differences.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'To keep in line with the depressing topics that I have covered in recent columns, I decided that this week would be devoted to one of the results of severe depression: enforced medical leave from a university. Enforced medical leave seems to be a tactic favored by many colleges to ensure that the pressure of college, one of the largest sources of stress in the life of many 18-to-20-something-year-olds, is removed from someone undergoing extreme mental duress. In theory, this provides students who are at risk of harming themselves or others more time and space to attend therapy, address any underlying issues and come back to college a fit individual. While this time is often used in pursuit of treatment, it can be and has been used by universities to prevent students with mental or emotional issues from returning to campus.BuzzFeed recently published an article detailing one such instance of a college preventing a student from returning to campus at Brown University. Dave originally attended Columbia University, but after testifying in a sexual assault disciplinary hearing on behalf of a friend, he decided to take a year off before enrolling in Brown University. The previous events of his collegiate career resulted in depression and anxiety on his part, which manifested itself in a post on Facebook about committing suicide. Dave was placed on medical leave by Brown and has currently appealed his case six times over the course of a year, each time failing to be reinstated as a student.Legally, schools can only remove a student with mental health issues if they pose a threat to themselves or others that can’t be eliminated by some sort of therapy and support. Furthermore, schools have to clearly relate what criteria must be met to reapply successfully and must explain their reasoning if they reject a student. Obviously, I wouldn’t be writing about this story if Brown had either accepted Dave or explained his rejection in a clear manner.So, the avid reader might ask, how does this relate to IU? To sum it all up: CAPS. Time and time again we as a community have seen IU’s Counseling and Psychological Services at its highs and lows. Every IUSA political campaign this year revolved around how to improve and expand CAPS. Just about anyone who knows anything about it says that we need more, and far too many people couldn’t tell you what the acronym stands for. We need more of those support structures that aid in the rehabilitation of students like Dave.It can’t, however, just be CAPS that needs to do better; it has to be us as well. The student body needs to raise awareness of the challenges of mental illness, break what stigma remains surrounding counseling and rally to support those individuals in our community that need it most.',\n",

       "  'body': 'In many instances, the path of least resistance involves laxness or inconsistent leniency. However, this is often not what those we work for and share our lives with need from us. Giving structure to our work, conduct and personal lives is an important step toward ?self-betterment.Therapeutic structure and consistency is a key aspect of the work I do. In social work, each client the practitioner collaborates with is in need of a high degree of predictability and steadfastness from the worker.By remaining calm in moments of crisis, firm in regard to established plans and legalities and understanding and unshakable emotionally, the worker models healthy ?structuring for the individuals with whom he or she works.But with professional jargon aside, providing structure for yourself and others is important to those of all walks of life.In my personal experience, structure and self-discipline have been difficult to establish and implement. Throughout the course of my life, both at home and on my own, I have lived in loose and highly flexible ?environments.Although this fits well with my demeanor and personality, it is not conducive to success in many important situations. I am a chronic procrastinator, I’m constantly a few minutes late and I regularly do not get enough sleep due to my oversight in setting a time to turn in.Thus far, these implications have not carried any substantial consequences in my life. However, this is not the reality for individuals living in at-risk scenarios.The youth I currently work with have often had to make do without consistent food, shelter, safety, attention or nourishing emotional living situations.Often, extremely unhealthy and degrading behavior has become a norm for them at home: adult-to-minor sexual relations and assault, prostitution and commodification of the body and stealing for survival, to name a few.For these young people, learning about, finding and living within a structured environment is both therapeutic and critical. Simple tasks many of us take for granted must be learned and incorporated into a schedule.Although the majority of IU’s student body is not in need of such a serious life style overhaul, we can all take something beneficial away from addressing the need for structured living.It can be as simple as setting a nighttime hygiene routine or as complex as ironing out a concrete weekly assignment schedule, but we can all better our lives by introducing structure to an area to which we have previously been given free roam.sjdickma@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Sexual assault and rape have been at the top of college news headlines for decades. Even this past year, IUPD alerted us to a number of on-and off-campus rapes that occurred. However, I can honestly say that I have never heard of even one case of domestic violence that has occurred here at IU, let alone at any college.A Buzzfeed article helped reveal to me the scope of this issue and how rampant domestic violence is on all campuses, even here at IU.This recent piece included an anecdote from our very own IU regarding Miriam Woods. Miriam realized that her boyfriend was abusive after a long period of physical and emotional aggression that culminated in him punching her in the arm and face.She had already begun cutting herself and thinking about committing suicide. While she was able to obtain a protective order through the state courts, she felt unsafe being on the same campus as her abuser. A friend recommended she contact IU’s Title IX coordinator to make a formal complaint.Title IX should hopefully sound familiar to anyone who has followed IU news for the past year, as IU was one of many colleges being investigated for Title IX compliance, which prohibits discrimination based on sex in federally funded schools, protecting victims of sexual and relational violence ?as well.As you might have guessed, Miriam’s case did not fare well. While she won her case because she chose to appeal the decision in the hopes of a higher punishment for her abusive ex, she unknowingly suspended the previous decision, permitting him to attend ?graduation.The issues involved with this case, as well as with domestic abuse in general, are incredibly complex, and I do not have the word count allotment to breach the subject more than I already have.I can, however, try to raise awareness by using whatever public voice I have, especially this column. I obviously find any form of abuse abhorrent. What I find problematic is how our school has failed to address this issue, especially in light of the fact that sexual assault awareness flyers line every bathroom and hallway in the university.So what can we as a student body and integral part of the city of Bloomington do to further protect those affected by violence? I believe that we must begin to advocate ceaselessly for further reform at all levels of jurisprudence to provide more resources to survivors. Training police to better handle abuse cases, as IUPD has in regard to sexual assault, may help more cases of domestic violence find justice.While the issue of domestic violence on college campuses has been stunningly silent, I have been stunned by the personal stories that lie in that silence.mccinkos@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'On May 19, Columbia University student Emma Sulkowicz became an alumna of her prestigious university and solidified her status as the encapsulation of collegiate rape culture.When she walked across the stage to become a graduate, all eyes were on President Lee Bollinger. This was his opportunity to extend her the most superficial of gestures, the most basic expression of goodwill and congratulations to her academic achievements.Sulkowicz, trailed by two friends who aided her in carrying her mattress, strode up to Bollinger to shake his hand, and he refused. He turned away and forced Sulkowicz to pass by unacknowledged, and the symbolism of that demonstration is devastating.While the sexual assault allegations were in dispute, Sulkowicz has developed a national profile by choosing to advocate on her own behalf in a highly visible, public way: While a student at Columbia, she carried her mattress with her wherever she went as an inescapably tangible reminder both of the tragedy she survived and ?the university’s lack of action against her aggressor.Sulkowicz says she was sexually assaulted by another student in 2014. She initially chose not to report it. She knew such a process would require her to recount and relive all the ?harrowing details.However, when Sulkowicz encountered two other classmates with similar accounts regarding the same individual, she felt compelled to participate in their group effort to address an issue clearly rampant ?on campus.All three women went through Columbia’s administrative channels, and all three allegations were denied. The university found their assailant not guilty, and the three students — along with who knows how many others — were forced to live in fear in their own community beneath the governance of a system that cared nothing for their safety.In response, Sulkowicz has carried her mattress with her everywhere for nearly a year to raise awareness about the rape culture cavalierly perpetuated by Columbia’s administration and gained a huge amount of attention throughout ?the nation.A Columbia spokesperson later claimed Sulkowicz “charged past” Bollinger and did not give him the chance to finish getting a drink of water, which is what he was allegedly doing when he turned his back on her. However, as the singular leader of a prestigious university, it is ridiculous to assert that Bollinger lacked the wherewithal to notice Sulkowicz’s approach and grasp the significance of that moment.Bollinger’s decision to snub Sulkowicz was almost certainly politically motivated. Paul Nungesser, the alleged assailant, recently sued Bollinger and Columbia for defamation of character and failure to address her “harassment,” so he likely chose to avoid adding fuel to the defamation lawsuit by publicly validating her with a handshake.The problem is that validation is exactly what Sulkowicz and her fellow survivors require and deserve. Acknowledgement of their experience, support from the institutions that claim to have their best interests at heart and ?justice through the theoretically protective frameworks around them are among the most basic of their rights, as Columbia students and as ?human beings.But Bollinger chose to deny Sulkowicz her humanity. He demonstrated a total disapproval of her right to the respect and care her personhood deserves and firmly placed himself on the side of the perpetrators of crimes of negligence.The moment Bollinger faked a drink of water to avoid deigning a student who turned to him for help with a handshake, he reminded those working to end the threat of sexual assault on college campuses that a long road still lies ahead.The issue is persisting even in ivy-covered halls. It bears reiterating that proponents of safety and justice face antagonists not criminal, but criminally negligent.sbkissel@indiana.edu',\n",

Safety Escort is funded through IU Parking Services, so there is no cost to ride.Hours are Sunday through Thursday from 8pm to 1:45 a.m., and Friday/Saturday 8 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. Call (812) 855-SAFE (855-7233) for a ride. While summer classes are in session, hours are 8 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. seven days a week. The service stops taking calls before closing time if its call capacity is reached for the night.Last spring the service went mobile by allowing Android and Apple device users to arrange for rides using the TapRide app. There are also several taxi services in Bloomington whose rates vary depending on the distance travelled.What are those blue lights I see spread across campus?The blue lights have a (red) button that can be pressed to immediately call 911 in the event of an emergency.The location of the blue light is automatically communicated to the police. Blue lights also have the capability of allowing a caller to dial a local number in a non-emergency situation.What is IUPD?IUPD is Indiana University’s very own police department that operates all day, every day.What’s the difference between IUPD and BPD?IUPD’s primary area of jurisdiction is the IU campus, while Bloomington Police Department’s primary area of jurisdiction is the surrounding city.Do you have any suggestions for how I can stay safest on campus?If you see something that makes you feel uneasy or you consider to be unsafe, call 911 immediately. IUPD would rather respond and find that there is no problem than not receive a call.IUPD offers several safety programs and group presentations, including the Rape Aggression Defense course. See indiana.edu/~iupd/communityPrograms.html for more information. Students are also encouraged to talk to police officers anytime, not just when there is a problem.Part-time officers are full-time students at IU Bloomington who also completed the IU Police Academy to become fully sworn Indiana law enforcement officers. Many of them live in and/or work at the campus dormitories.Are there social media accounts to follow to stay on top of campus safety?It is important to keep contact information current for the university’s IU Notify emergency alert system. Students can do this by logging into one.iu.edu and conducting a search for IU Notify. IU Notify is used for two types of notices: emergency notifications warn students when they need to take immediate action to avoid danger, and crime alerts warn of ongoing threats or concerns of whichstudents should be aware such as a sexual assault.Texts are the quickest way to receive the time-sensitive emergency notifications, so students should include their cell phone numbers with their IU Notify contact information.The Bloomington Police Department has a Facebook page (Bloomington Police Department) and Twitter account ?@BltgINPolice that students, especially those living off-campus, might find useful.Where is IUPD located and how can I contact the department?IUPD is located at 1469 E. 17th St., west of Jordan Avenue. Non-emergency calls can be placed to 812-855-4111. Call 911 in case of emergency.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The year was 1938, and Dr. Alfred Kinsey engaged a packed auditorium of anxious students in conversation about a taboo ?topic: sex.Decades later, Kinsey’s devotion to studying human sexuality and shattering the silence on sexual health is illuminated in the halls of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction and continues to inspire and inform IU students, the Bloomington community and the world.The Kinsey Institute is the world’s leading sexuality and sexual health research center Jennifer Bass, Kinsey ?Communications Director, said.“As you go around the world, people might know the Kinsey Institute and might not even know Indiana University,” Bass said. “It takes time for some students to know that we’re even here.”In addition to its research and ?educational programs, the Institute has rotating art exhibits that change in theme each semester.In addition to her class at Kinsey, the art is another reason for junior English and gender studies major Susannah Beckman to visit the Institute.“I love going and looking at it,” Beckman said. “I think I’m always surprised by something I see just because you see things produced more than a hundred years ago that you never thought about existing then.”Studying the portrayal of sexuality throughout history helps students and researchers better understand sex, Bass said.“There’s only so much you can learn from talking about sex, and there’s only so much you can learn about emotions from words,” Bass said. “If you look at artwork from different times about sensitive topics, you get to a different understanding of where you ?are now.”Studying erotic art throughout history is helpful for society when thinking about modern pornography, Kinsey Art Curator Catherine Johnson-Roehr said.“Artists have been interested in depicting the human body and images of a sexual nature in almost forever,” Johnson-Roehr said. “The fact that they continue today is not ?surprising.”One of the spring 2015 print exhibits even included a print by Rembrandt called the French Bed.“It’s very interesting to realize, ‘Wow, there was a lot going on before you were born,’” Bass said. “It helps put things in perspective about our world and as us as humans that books cannot do.”Bass said the Institute began showcasing its archived art as thematic exhibits in 1996. Beckman enjoyed seeing the fall semester’s exhibit, which displayed art that showed the relationship between sex and food.“There’s so much amazing art at the Kinsey Institute that you won’t get to see anywhere else,” Beckman said. “It’s a great opportunity to see the new shows and to see as much of it as possible.”Visitors can be assured that there will always be art for them to see when they come to Morrison Hall.“The unique thing is that our shows change,” Johnson-Roehr said. “Somebody who came here last year will see something different when they come back.”The Institute has recently shifted its research focus to studying the biology of sex and relationships, Bass said.“The focus has been on sexuality and why people make decisions on what they do with their sex lives,” Bass said. “Now, it’s getting more to the biological basis of love and nurture.”Other topics being explored by current research at the Institute includes studying sexual assault on campus, hormonal contraceptives in various environments and long-term relationships versus “hookups,” Bass said.“It’s a scholarship all on its own and a language all on its own,” Bass said. “It’s really profound.” For more information, visit ?kinseyinstitute.org.',\n",

       "  'body': \"An IU Police Department officer was accused of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old female student in a campus residence hall early in the morning on April 24. The accused man is a 25-year-old IU student who worked as a part-time officer, IU spokesperson Mark Land said in an email.While an IUPD crime log categorized the incident as a rape, Land said it was reported as a sexual assault. As soon as IUPD found out one of its officers was being accused, the force suspended the accused male without pay pending the investigation, Land said. The officer resigned from IUPD last week.The alleged sexual assault took place between 2 and 3 a.m. on the 1800 block of East 10th Street, Bloomington Police Department Capt. Joseph Qualters said in an email. Qualters did not specify the residence hall in which the incident took place. The woman said the man, with whom she was somewhat familiar, came into her room uninvited while she was in the room with a female friend, Qualters said. “Some level of intoxication” was reported by both parties involved, Qualters said. At some point, the man ended up in the woman’s bed, where the sexual assault allegedly took place. The victim reported the alleged sexual assault at 1:54 p.m. the same day at IU Health Bloomington Hospital. IUPD was initially called to the hospital to respond to the report since it occurred on campus, Land said. However, when IUPD found out one of its officers was being accused, BPD was contacted to handle the case. When detectives spoke with both parties, they each provided different versions of what happened, Qualters said. The accused male reported being invited into the room, while the woman said he was uninvited. The man was also removed from his residence hall, Land said. A possible witness was also interviewed for the investigation, which was turned over to the Monroe County Prosecutor's Office, Qualters said.The prosecutor's office confirmed Monday afternoon that it will not be pressing charges against the man, but did not specify why.Samantha SchmidtThis story has been updated to correct the nature of the sexual assault. \",\n",

       "  'body': 'Until this year, Student Life and Learning did not publicly specify which fraternities were facing University sanctions due to allegations of sexual assault. The approach was to investigate the student organization under any allegations and, if an event was determined to have contributed to unsafe conditions through the serving of alcohol, the student organization was sanctioned, said Dean Veldkamp, assistant dean of students and director of Student Life and Learning, in an email.Because of new federal guidance, the University adjusted its review process in fall 2014 to also hold a student organization accountable for creating an unsafe environment in connection to a personal conduct incident.These are now reflected as follows:Allegation of druggingDruggingAllegation of Sexual AssaultSexual AssaultSince then, IU is currently investigating three student organizations and has held three groups accountable this academic year.The groups that have been held accountable are:Delta Chi: Unsafe environment that resulted in an allegation of drugging.Men’s Rugby Club: Unsafe environment that resulted in an allegation of drugging.Sigma Phi Epsilon: Unsafe environment that resulted in a sexual assault and alcohol violation.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Students across campus read the email subject line: CRIME ALERT — REPORTED RAPE.Students learned the victim had been drinking at a party on the afternoon of April 11 and had experienced a loss of memory. The suspect was 5-foot-9 to 6 feet tall and had brown hair.But one question went unanswered: Where?The IU Police Department refused requests by the Indiana Daily Student to release the location ?of the assault.A new University procedure conceals the locations of sexual assaults reported to IUPD in an effort to protect the confidentiality of the victim, a University lawyer said.The lack of information leaves students wondering whether their dorms and neighborhoods are safe.The change is based on “federal guidance and feedback from our community,” Assistant General Counsel Aimee Burkert Oestreich said in an email.The federal Jeanne Clery Act ?requires universities to notify students when a crime occurs and provide a general location. Burkert Oesterich said the change meets the requirements of the act, which allows enough vagueness to protect victim ?confidentiality.In the past, the University has specified locations of IUPD sexual assault reports with names of specific campus buildings, student dormitories, fraternity houses and other University-affiliated locations. Unless the location was unknown or releasing it would directly identify a victim, the University would generally release the address of a reported sexual assault.As of this year, the locations will only include general descriptors such as whether the incident occurred in on-campus housing or in on-campus student organization housing.This change was spurred by feedback from students who have experienced sexual assault, said Emily Springston, chief student welfare and Title IX officer.“One of the reasons people do not want to come forward is their feeling of everyone knowing,” ?Springston said.Attorney Frank LoMonte, executive director of the Student Press Law Center, said in an email the changes are inconsistent with IU’s Clery obligations. The Clery Act requires giving people enough information about a crime to be able to take precautions to protect themselves, including a description of the location, LoMonte said.“The whole point of giving the alert is, first, to allow people to avoid areas that are known to be dangerous and, second, to encourage people to come forward if they’ve witnessed a crime,” LoMonte said. “If you don’t describe the location, you defeat both purposes.”LoMonte also said omitting the location suggests the University believes every place on campus is equally dangerous.“It’s incredibly strange in this climate of heightened consciousness about campus crime that a university’s response would be to err on the side of less information instead of more,” ?LoMonte said.Opinions about this new procedure are mixed among students. Some think it will obstruct transparency within the greek system specifically because fraternity houses will not be named in connection to reported sexual assaults. Some in the greek community think the changes may encourage more victims to report sexual assaults.Panhellenic Association President Margaret Hensley said in an email she hopes by knowing the location of the assault will be kept private, women will be more likely to seek the help they need.Although underreporting is an issue for all students across campus, Springston said she worries about the pressures within the greek system.Students and survivors of sexual assault say women who are raped in fraternities sometimes choose not to report out of fear of getting the fraternity in trouble or hurting the status of their ?sorority.At an event organized by Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault and Safe Sisters in March, students sat in groups to discuss solutions for preventing sexual assault and its stigma within the greek ?system.They talked about the growing number of resources that encourage members of chapters to report. Amy Blake, a sophomore in Phi Mu who is a member of Safe Sisters, talked about how ?social status and relationships between chapters sometimes hinder a victim’s decision to report a sexual ?assault.“It’s frustrating that social status gets in the way of morality,” Blake said.Many students reiterated that a fraternity as a whole should not be judged or stereotyped by the actions of one person.Blake said she agrees, but transparency is more ?important.“You should know where you’re going and what’s happened there,” Blake said. “You trust these guys.”Blake later said the level of transparency in sexual assault cases should be up to the victim.“If a victim wants it to not be announced, it should be respected,” Blake said. “But other than that, how could it hurt to announce ?the location?”Lauren Devereux, a junior in Theta Phi Alpha and a member of Safe Sisters, was sexually assaulted last summer at an off-campus party at her friend’s place attended by several members of one fraternity. Devereux requested the fraternity’s name be ?withheld.The hookup was consensual at first, but Devereux said things started to get uncomfortable and painful. She repeatedly asked him to stop, but he didn’t.She told her close friends about the night, but she didn’t initially report it to the University or to the police. She did not want her sorority to have to stop pairing with the fraternity, so she occasionally saw him at parties. One time, he had planned on attending a date party with her sorority, but her sorority’s president prohibited him from coming.“I shouldn’t have to go to my events with the fear that I’m going to be running into my rapist,” Devereux said.In October, Devereux emailed the fraternity’s president. She told him what happened, and he immediately turned the man in to the Office of Student Ethics, Devereux said. When the office reached out to Devereux, she was unsure if she wanted to pursue an investigation.“They were a fraternity that we pair with all the time,” Devereux said. “I didn’t want to ruin that relationship.”She was reluctant, but eventually cooperated with an investigation by the Office of Student Ethics. On the Friday of Little 500 weekend, she learned the man was held responsible and suspended from school for more than ?a year.“I cried,” Devereux said. “I finally felt like someone ?believed me.”Devereux has never gone back to a pair with the man’s fraternity, but she also does not think his fraternity should be held responsible for his poor judgment. Her rape did not occur at one of the fraternity’s organized parties and had nothing to do with an unsafe environment they ?created.Regarding the University’s refusal to release the locations of sexual assault, ?Devereux was torn.She said she thinks it is important for the public to have access to those records. By looking at areas where sexual assaults are concentrated, maybe the public can study trends of outside factors influencing sexual assaults. Are there more parties in certain areas? Fewer emergency resources available in certain parts of campus? Less IUPD coverage?“But it’s not fair to have that all on a fraternity,” ?she said.She said she thinks an isolated incident should not indicate students are in danger at a specific chapter.“Fraternities don’t rape people,” Devereux said. ?“People rape people.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Imagine you’re doing your typical Tuesday night routine: avoiding homework and watching Netflix.You hear your phone buzz, and your heart leaps in your throat at the thought of your friends or, even better, your crush texting you. But when you look at that screen, hope flees and panic fills ?its place.“IU Bloomington Alert” reads the top of the text. In the message, you read details about a sexual assault that includes a description of the suspect and the typical warnings that accompany all crime alerts. But there’s just one thing missing: a location.The above scenario seems rather ridiculous when you think about it. How in the world are students supposed to stay safe and avoid the area in question without being given a location?The University is making a change to its procedures that will prevent revealing locations of sexual assaults reported to the IU Police Department. Information on locations will be described using generic details, like whether an assault occurred in on-campus housing or in on-campus student organization housing.These new changes came into place after feedback from students who’ve experienced sexual assault was brought to the attention of the University. Fears of losing anonymity have fueled victims into asking locations be eliminated in the crime alerts.We on the Editorial Board sympathize with victims. Such a heinous act committed against another human being can seem even more monstrous when the entire student population knows details about it. But not revealing a location of sexual assault would be doing more harm than good.Unfortunately, no one is really surprised when we hear there’s a rape. Sexual assault on campuses across this country is an epidemic we’re all too familiar with. Receiving an alert that does nothing but notify an assault occurred somewhere on campus only validates what we already know.What’s the point of informing students if you don’t reveal information that could potentially be helpful?Giving a description of a suspect that matches a large percentage of the population doesn’t assist in reporting tips when you don’t add context clues. How is anyone supposed to report suspicious activity they may have seen if they aren’t told where a crime was committed?Also, alerts tell students when to be on their guard. Yes, we know at this point that rapists come in all types of personalities and they aren’t just scary shadows hiding in bushes but people we know, trust and love.But when there are repeated crime alerts for sexual assault for a single location, say, a fraternity house, it lets students know there could potentially be a problem at this location.The Editorial Board doesn’t want to make victims uncomfortable, and we certainly don’t want to aid in their pain during an invasive process of reporting. We understand why they would feel giving a location is violating their anonymity. But giving a building name is informative for the students, yet vague enough for the victim that both parties will receive some form of benefit.In the long run, these changes won’t help victims of sexual assault. It will only aid in the destructive manner this school has dealt with sexual assault.',\n",

       "  'body': 'As a sports journalism major, I can attest that working in sports changes you. You lose your fandom; you lose your bias. You see the game in a new light — the good and the bad.Athletes rise to greatness in the same light — the spotlight. Many of them crave it. So it isn’t surprising, then, that a sports critic would want to turn that light out.Keith Olbermann, host of the ESPN2 show “Olbermann,” called for a boycott of today’s much-anticipated NFL Draft and Saturday’s Manny Pacquiao-Floyd Mayweather fight.In a seven-minute segment, Olbermann lambasted projected first-overall pick Jameis Winston for his accused sexual assault and Mayweather for his documented domestic abuse.Olbermann asked his audience to “become the adults” by refusing to watch these athletes on TV.And it’s hard to argue with him. Sports culture suffers incontrovertibly from issues of violence and abusive behaviors on and off the field.The Ray Rice elevator tape, the Alex Rodriguez trial, the Junior Seau suicide.These events got the ball rolling, exposing what Olbermann calls “the evils of the sports industry.”Just this week, two more prospective and past NFL first-round draftees were reprimanded — by the league or by the law — for drug-related charges.The New York Times ran an article Sunday about a born-and-raised football player who took his life at 32.A postmortem examination revealed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the same degenerative brain disease that plagued Seau, one of 18 diseased professional players diagnosed with CTE.To watch sports, by Olbermann’s logic, is to condone these instances of abuse and violence.But we can’t turn out the light. Sport, through our participation, involvement and spectatorship, ingrains indispensable lessons.For me, that lesson comes from the word “best.”There is no perpetual best in sports. Every streak must end; every athlete must retire. In sports, best is the flat, precipitous space everyone wants to knock you off of.And they will succeed.The greatest aspect of sports isn’t about reaching the top. It’s about teaching us what comes after.Sports aren’t a conduit through which violence and aggression funnels out — it has the same capacity to instill integrity as it does criminality.The game is in our hands. It’s in the players’ hands. It’s in the way we choose to portray it and talk about it.If we turn off the TV, Jameis Winston still gets drafted. Floyd Mayweather still fights.We have to begin to alter the message. We have to “become the adults,” as Olbermann advocates.But let’s not become the adults who respond to violence; let’s step in before the violence ensues.In the end, we have to choose whether we condemn a system, a way of life, because of the actions of a few individuals.I choose to see the light.vziege@indiana.edu',\n",

She pressed charges, and though the alleged rapist was convicted, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the decision in 1998. They argued because the victim wore tight jeans, she must have helped her rapist remove them, making the act consensual. Women in the Italian Parliament wore jeans in protest the following day. The California Senate backed the protest, and Denim Day was born. In 2008 the Italian Supreme Court finally overturned its findings and eliminated the “denim defense” to rape charges.Today Denim Day has become an annual, international event to spread awareness not only about sexual assault but perhaps more importantly about the need to stop victim blaming on all levels.

       "  'body': 'Daniel Messel would go to work, come home and spend time with his nephew before heading out to trivia on Thursday nights. He didn’t come home after leaving for a night out last Thursday, and his stepfather, Gerald Messel, didn’t know why.He also didn’t know IU student Hannah Wilson was missing and that “Danny,” as he calls him, would be arrested in the front yard Friday in connection with her death.When Daniel finally arrived home sometime Friday afternoon, Gerald said, the police were already there waiting. Daniel walked into the house, collected some clothes and said nothing.“He wouldn’t tell me anything,” Gerald said.Police had already obtained a warrant and seized Daniel’s computer, car and cell phone. He was arrested on a preliminary murder charge and is currently being held in Brown County Jail.Around 8:30 a.m. Friday, a woman who was driving discovered the body behind an abandoned lot near the Needmore area of Brown County, according to ?police.Typically, when investigators arrive, they process the scene and collect evidence.Though he couldn’t specify, Brown County Coroner Earl Piper said evidence was found at the scene that links Daniel to Hannah’s body. Hours after police finished their work at the crime scene, they arrested Daniel.Wilson, 22, was a senior studying psychology who was set to graduate in two weeks.On Saturday, Piper ruled Wilson’s death a homicide. She had been hit on the head with an unknown blunt object three or four times. Protective wounds were present, Piper said. Piper also indicated no signs of sexual assault were found during the autopsy. The toxicology report administered will take about 10 more days to process.Prior to Daniel’s arrest Friday, his criminal history involved charges for drunk driving and felony assault, according to court documents. In 1996, he was sentenced to eight years in prison after he was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon. Seven years earlier, according to the Herald-Times archives, Messel was arrested and jailed for confinement after his then-girlfriend told police he wouldn’t let her leave her own apartment.So on Sunday, while his stepson waited in a jail cell 30 minutes away, Gerald stood outside with Daniel’s beagle named Max.“It’s not more of a surprise,” Gerald said. “More of a shock.”When Daniel left for downtown Bloomington on Thursday evening, Gerald didn’t know where he had gone except that he usually played trivia on certain weeknights.Two weeks ago, Daniel competed in the Volunteers in Tutoring Adult Learners annual Quiz Bowl. Community Access Television Services Channel 3 broadcast the competition, Gerald said.Before last week, Gerald said, Daniel mentioned someone named “Hannah” after playing trivia at a ?Bloomington bar.Sunday, Gerald stood outside on the bright afternoon with the beagle as strangers drove past their home.“We got gawkers going up and down the road,” Gerald said. “This is a bad deal and the worst thing in my life.”',\n",

Nearly everyone in line craned their necks to watch the protesters as they marched past on the opposite side of the street.They were hard to miss. Almost 100 students and community members carrying neon signs marked with bold letters and chanting anti-slut shaming, pro-consent incantations drew attention.“Fuck You Robin Thicke,” one sign read. Another one read, “If she was asking for it ... why couldn’t you?” in black capital letters with red marker further emphasizing the “asking for it” and the “you.” Several other signs said things like “stop slut shaming” or “rape hurts everyone.”The march was part of SlutWalk Bloomington, an event hosted by the IU Feminist Student Association Thursday night to raise awareness about providing consent and preventing sexual assault.SlutWalk began at 6:30 p.m. in Dunn Meadow.Other groups such as Stop the Kyriarchy, Sexual Assault Crisis Service and The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction set up tables as well.Beyoncé music blared out of the speakers as students milled around from table to table, picking up signs or putting anonymous slips into a tissue box colored with pink roses with an index card on it reading “SLUT STATEMENT.”At 7 p.m., speeches started as Emily Springston, the Title IX ?coordinator at IU, emphasized the importance of consent.After Springston spoke, Evelyn Smith, Crisis Intervention Services Coordinator at Middle Way House, encouraged listeners to stop judging people by the way they ?present themselves.“We are labeled as sluts, we are labeled as whores, as bitches and we are labeled as monsters,” Smith said. “And the truth is, we are monsters. Not because we are agents of destruction, but because we are agents of change.”Then Ladies First, an a cappella group at IU, performed two songs before Morgan Mohr and Hannah Milner, director of activism and co-president of IUFSA, respectively, stood on stage and read some of the anonymous “slut statements,” which gave reasons for why people decided to come to the walk.“I’m here because when my best friend was raped at knife point, the lawyer told her that she probably liked ?it rough.”“Because I am not a piece of meat,” one said. “I am a person, respect me.” Cheers, whoops and a couple “yeahs” erupted from the audience.“Also, Trad Youth can fall off a white male ?Orthodox cliff.”Milner said her hope was for SlutWalk to promote awareness of sexual violence in a way that’s different and would catch a college student’s attention rather than blurring into the background and being forgotten.The march started at around 7:30 p.m., beginning at the edge of Dunn Meadow and continuing down ?Kirkwood Avenue.The marchers didn’t fail to turn the heads of many they passed. They turned right on College Avenue, right again on Sixth Street, right on Walnut Street and left to continue back up Kirkwood.A man who was mowing the lawn at First Christian Church stopped in his tracks, mouth open, to gawk at the marchers. One man pointed his thumb down and booed.“Raise your voice, get on your feet! Fight for ourselves, fight for our streets!”Several cars honked while driving past. One car slowed and the passenger stared at the protesters, mouth open, eyes narrowed.“This one’s for you,” a girl shouted, pointing at the ?passenger.“This little black dress does not mean yes!” the crowd chanted.Laura Dolezal — the girl who was holding the “Fuck You Robin Thicke” sign and a sophomore at IU — wore polka-dot tights, shorts and a lacey black corset-style shirt with two cherubs on it.When picking out her outfit, she said she deliberated carefully.“Those assholes we walked by — what’s something they’d look at and demean me for?”',\n",

So to all of the guys out there, you have to step up. That’s how we can change the culture on campus and around the country to one that ?understands no means no.”With the It’s On Us ?campaign, President Obama and Biden have made it a national priority to root out sexual violence and assault wherever it exists, especially in schools.It’s On Us was launched last year and seeks to ?empower college students not only to respond effectively to sexual assault but also to prevent it in the ?first place.It’s On Us was launched in partnership with student body leadership from ?almost 200 colleges and ?universities across the country, collegiate sports organizations, including the NCAA, and private ?companies.In the release, Biden ?announced new It’s On Us initiatives with websites Funny Or Die, Pandora, USA ?Network and various greek organizations.The initiative has partnerships with 75 non-profit and private sector businesses across the nation.It’s On Us is a part of the administration’s ?approach to combat sexual assault through the work of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from ?Sexual Assault.The Task Force was established by Obama on Jan. 22, 2014, and is ?co-led by the Office of the Vice President and the White House Council on Women and Girls.On April 29, 2014, the Task Force released its first report, “Not Alone,” which included recommendations, action steps and policy templates to help ?colleges and universities better address the problems.IU-Bloomington utilized a copy of the Not Alone ?Climate Survey, in addition to MIT health surveys, to guide the process of creating a baseline survey that was distributed via email during the fall 2014 semester.“We identified that this was a need on campus,” said Leslie Fasone, IU Assistant Dean of Students for Women’s and Gender Affairs.The November survey had an initial response rate of 23 percent. The ?Center of Survey Research has cleaned the data.Dr. Justin Garcia and ?Fasone are in the process of working with colleagues to analyze the data.“Right now we’re looking through the data and we’re working on a public report to be able to say, ‘Here’s the scope on campus, here’s the scope of the issue,’” ?Fasone said. “And using that to identify where we ?go next.”The results from the ?survey will provide baseline ?information that could hopefully provide indication of where to target ?prevention initiatives, ?Fasone said.“It can provide some context of where to go,” ?Fasone said. “Our plan is to be able to use that information to develop and enhance prevention and response initiatives at IU.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'How hot is consent?At coffee shops, about 200 degrees.“I like the play on words; it raises awareness,” Soma patron Patrick Hanaway said as he placed his latte in a labeled coffee sleeve.The label on his latte read “Consent is Hot! Got ?Consent? Ask.”Hanaway was in town Sunday for a memorial. He had never been to IU before, but campus sexual assault is no foreign topic.“I talk to my sons about it with my wife,” said Hanaway, whose two sons attend college at University of North Carolina campuses.“We talk to them about respect and consent,” Hanaway said. “A lot of people think that it’s a woman’s issue. It’s not. It’s a people’s issue.”Soma is one of more than 20 local coffee shops distributing the cardboard coffee sleeves during Sexual Assault Awareness Month in April.“More than a third of the women I know have been sexually assaulted,” Hanaway said before leaving Soma for the memorial, coffee in hand. “It changes their lives. As men, we need to be way more sensitive and have ?awareness.”The coffee sleeve campaign is co-sponsored by the Monroe County Prosecutor’s Office, the IU Dean of Students Office, IU Sexual Assault Crisis Service, the Monroe County Sexual Assault Response Team, IU Culture of Care and It’s On Us – Indiana University, according to a press release from the ?prosecutor’s office.Soma received a box of imprinted coffee sleeves Friday morning. By Sunday afternoon, they were mostly gone.“What we have out is what’s left,” Soma manager Greg Hays said during the busy Sunday afternoon. “I think that it would help with awareness.”The coffee sleeve message resonates with other campaign themes, including “Only Yes Means Yes” and “Silence, Passed Out, Intoxicated, Fear – Is Not Consent.”This month, the prosecutor’s office will also conduct live presentations at various locations around campus, titled “Blame It On The Alcohol? The Truths, Myths, and Laws of Sexual Assault.”“This is a creative way to get the message out about an important issue in a college town,” Monroe County Prosecutor Chris Gaal said in the release. “We received an enthusiastic response from local businesses eager ?to participate.”City Bakery is another local company distributing ?the sleeves.“We are thrilled to be part of this effort,” Robert Himmel, owner of City Bakery said in the release. “I hope it starts some early morning discussions about what consent means.”The “Consent is Hot” idea echoes messages in a video about consent produced by the prosecutor’s office called “Let’s Talk About Sex.” The video has received more than 13,000 views on YouTube.“The message of asking for consent is definitely the right one,” said Debbie Melloan of IU Sexual Assault Crisis Services in the release. “It’s a message that’s always ?relevant.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'On an unusually warm Saturday in February, a group of students swig from blue Solo cups and dangle their feet out second-story windows, where they snap pictures of the crowd on the porch below. A single can of Natural Light sits atop a sign of the letter A, the first of the fraternity’s three letters: ATO.The party at the Alpha Tau Omega house is a rare sight for students passing by on Third Street. The fraternity has been off social probation for only a month, and the men are being scrutinized by the administration. But after seven ethics cases, four semesters of probation and one year after a girl said she was raped in the house, ATO is having a party.The fraternity isn’t trying to party secretly in a dark basement. They’re out in the open, on the front porch. In the middle of the afternoon.ATO President Tommy Paslaski cannot stand still. The sophomore scans the party for floating handles of vodka. He walks up to a brother, takes a handle away from him and pours the liquor into a plastic cup for him instead.Walking around the side of the ATO house, he spots a drunken girl climbing on to the rooftop. He immediately asks her to get down.She laughs, “Fuck off.”She doesn’t seem to know who he is. Annoyed but unfazed, the president asks her a second time. She gets down.The girl is a liability — his guest and his responsibility. If one drunken partygoer goes to the hospital, if one ATO member gets too belligerent, if one girl falls off the roof and breaks her neck, ATO could be back on social probation — or worse, kicked off campus for good.Paslaski carries it all on his shoulders.Chapter 2Rarely have fraternities nationwide faced sharper criticism than in the past few months. A Sigma Phi Epsilon pledge at Clemson University was found dead after allegedly refusing to buy his brothers McDonald’s. Members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon at the University of Oklahoma were videotaped singing a racist song. A Facebook page for Penn State’s Kappa Delta Rho displayed photographs of drugs, hazing and nude women.On a campus known nationwide for its greek life, with the “world’s greatest college weekend” days away, Paslaski must keep one of IU’s most infamous fraternities off probation and out of the headlines.He’s heard the names people call ATO. “AT Blow,” “AT Snow” “The Party House” and even “The Rape House.” Before pledging, Paslaski refused to believe the rumors that if he joined ATO he would have to “do a line of coke and get a dildo” — both of which ended up being entirely false.ATO’s reputation is scarred in part by its notorious but discontinued “Ménage à Tau” party, an annual, exclusive soiree at which female guests drank expensive alcohol and wore lingerie. It was there, last year, that a student said she was raped.Paslaski received minimal training for the job, but every weekend he has to manage hundreds of intoxicated men and women under one roof. Every day, he makes decisions that could affect — and potentially upset — up to 140 men.These men are his closest friends, the kind of guys who are always there to listen if he just needs to watch a game of football and vent, a group of men who stood together even when their fraternity was in shambles.Paslaski knows ATO is more than a party house. He just needs to prove it.View Fraternity Crimes in a full screen map*The data points were compiled from IU Police Department crime logs from 2009-2015 and filtered to include incidents that were reported to have occurred either at a fraternity house or at a location associated with a fraternity. Incidents that were reported by members of a fraternity, such as theft or vandalism that involved no citations for a fraternity member, were omitted. One time, when a girl saw Paslaski wearing his fraternity letters, she said she found it hard to believe he joined ATO. When it comes to ATO stereotypes, Paslaski — along with many of his friends in ATO — doesn’t fit the bill.“Paslo,” as his brothers call him, is a telecommunications major and business minor. In a perfect world, he would work as a special education teacher, he says, but he’ll probably end up going into business. He went to Catholic school, served as a religious retreat leader and spent six years volunteering with kids with autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy.“It helped me get a good perspective on the world,” Paslaski said. “It really centers me.”A first-born with three sisters in high school, Paslaski grew up surrounded by women. While his sisters all played with Barbies, Paslaski was often alone. He always wanted a brother.His father was an ATO at IU, and Paslaski grew up hearing stories of the three years in which his dad biked in the Little 500 during the early 1980s, shortly after the release of “Breaking Away.”When Paslaski met the ATO guys for a rush event his freshman year, they seemed genuine. The chapter was an obvious choice.Earlier this school year, Paslaski attended the Indiana Greek Emerging Leaders conference and a couple of his brothers told him he should run for president. He was elected and came back from winter break with something about him that screamed change, said sophomore and ATO Vice President Christian Albrecht.“He’s one of the most motivated people I’ve ever met,” Albrecht said. “He’s trying to get everyone not to just better the house but better themselves.”So far, Paslaski’s efforts seem to be working. The chapter’s average GPA is at its highest in more than five years, and its retention rate is higher than in years past, said Wynn Smiley, CEO for the national ATO fraternity. Paslaski encouraged all ATO pledges to apply for Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault. ATO is one of the most involved chapters in the group.Paslaski is also training for two triathlons this summer and hopes to compete in an Iron Man next summer. He works out nine times a week, and has a resting heart rate of 49 beats per minute. It’s common for Paslaski to go straight from monitoring a party to running six miles.“It helps me cope with the stress,” Paslaski said.He thinks sleep is a waste of time.Chapter 3In the ATO formal living room one Monday night, the executive board members sit in couches in a circle, where they rest their feet on the coffee table in the center. Paslaski looks at his notes while scarfing down a plate of fried chicken and mashed potatoes — he hasn’t had time to eat \\r\\ndinner yet.Paslaski talks about the plans for that week — an American Red Cross Blood Drive, an interview for campus greek life awards. This will also be the week to encourage members to apply for positions on several new committees, including public relations, food and intramural athletics.“More stuff will get done the more people are involved in the house,” Paslaski says.He talks about an ATO member who broke a lamp in the house when he was drunk one night, and, as punishment, the Judicial Board told him he would have to be sober on “Quals,” the qualifying race day for Little 500 bike teams and the infamous day of nonstop partying around campus.“We used to live in a house where you could get too drunk and punch a window and everyone cheers,” Paslaski says. But not on his watch.“It’s really not hard to not intentionally punch out a \\r\\nwindow,” he says.The guys talk about how to teach pledges to sober monitor parties — always put vodka handles away at midnight, never pre-pour drinks. Wear black-and-white referee shirts, just in case people need to know who’s calling the shots. Make sure every girl signs in, so they can keep track of which sororities are present in case something happens.Sober monitors had to turn away a group of girls that weekend because they were too drunk, Paslaski says. It’s not always easy for freshman pledges to turn away girls, Albrecht tells the group.“What would you rather have, a drunk girl being pissed at you or your house being in jeopardy?” Albrecht says.No major risk issues have come up yet this semester, Paslaski says.The guys all knock on the wooden table.“Let’s keep that up,”Paslaski says.Chapter 4Times were different when Paslaski’s dad was an ATO at IU. The University was less strict — ATO could throw keg parties on the roof and invite more than two or three sororities. It was the era of “Animal House.”In 1992, the IU chapter made national news. At an initiation party, freshman Dennis Jay Jr. and his pledge brothers were forced to drink whiskey and wine from a funnel while blindfolded until they threw up, according to an article in People magazine. Jay ended up hospitalized in a coma, with a nearly fatal .48 blood alcohol content. He survived, but the fraternity was kicked off campus.After three alcohol and fraternity-related student deaths between 1998 and 2000, the University began to crack down more on parties, said Mike Schmeckebier, an adviser for ATO who works as an associate director for graduate career services at the Kelley School of Business.Parties moved to dark basements behind closed blinds. Out went the kegs, and in came the shots of cheap vodka.ATO slowly regained its social status on campus, which fed into the chapter’s party culture.“That stigma started getting in people’s heads,” Paslaski said. “It crashed and burned.”The chapter was almost kicked off campus in 2010 for hazing and serving alcohol to minors. One hundred ATO members were kicked out. The remaining 20 — almost all freshmen — were forced by their housing board to move out of their house on Third Street and into the Rubicon apartments on Kirkwood \\r\\nAvenue.Rules were different for the guys who lived off campus, said Robert Vechiola, Paslaski’s predecessor as president. Fewer guys wanted to rush a fraternity without a house.ATO got its house back in August 2012. Just more than a year later, it was back on disciplinary probation. At a homecoming party, ATO members called an ambulance to take a drunken girl to the hospital Paslaski said. During sorority “Bid Week,” a freshman girl was sent to the hospital from her dorm after attending an ATO party. During a Welcome Week party the following year, an ATO member called an ambulance yet again.Vechiola would be summoned to seven different University ethics board hearings during his yearlong presidency — more than any other fraternity president that year, he said.“At the end of the day, there’s someone responsible for people at every social event,” Vechiola said. “It all leads back to one person, the president.”The University encourages every fraternity and sorority to make the call to 911 when someone is dangerously drunk. The Hoosier Proactive Alcohol Care Treatment protects students and student organizations from certain punishments related to alcohol consumption, said Melissa Kish, who advises greek life for Student Life and Learning.But ATO members discovered that there’s a catch. If the Hoosier PACT is used more than once, an organization could face additional sanctions and an ethics hearing, Kish said.“You don’t get to play Hoosier PACT every week,” \\r\\nKish said.Some of these ethics cases seemed like bad luck to Vechiola. They were almost all spurred by individual party attendees who got too drunk — oftentimes because they drank too much at other fraternities before coming to ATO.Most of the complaints seemed minor. Then came Ménage.Chapter 5The theme of ATO’s annual “Ménage à Tau” party was exactly what it sounded like — a play on the French phrase \\r\\nménage à trois, meaning threesome. Each fraternity brother would invite two dates, and each date would come wearing nothing but lingerie.An article on  BroBible.com called Ménage à Tau one of the “Top 10 college parties in the nation.”Senior Lizzy DeHaven went to the party last year with her boyfriend, a senior in ATO.“When I first heard about it I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’” DeHaven said. “Then it became this big fun thing.”The idea of two dates made sense to DeHaven. A brother could invite his girlfriend, who could then invite one of her own friends. An invite to Ménage à Tau became a symbol of status, Paslaski said.“It’s not like we were begging girls,” Paslaski said. “Girls would go out of their way to come to Ménage.”Each ATO brother would serenade the girls he wanted to invite. Girls would buy lingerie, and they always felt like they had to be in their best shape, DeHaven said. Dieting before Ménage was common, she said.Stretch Hummer limos would pick up each date on the night of the party, Paslaski said, and the brothers would buy large quantities of expensive alcohol — no beer or Karkov, just the fancy stuff, like champagne and Grey Goose.“If you’re drinking heavily and girls are in lingerie, something’s going to happen,” \\r\\nDeHaven said.At last year’s Ménage, something did happen. Word quickly spread that a girl had been sexually assaulted, \\r\\nDeHaven said.Within 24 hours, Vechiola and the Judicial Board had kicked the brother out of ATO, Vechiola said.“They were shocked that this guy did this,” DeHaven said. “You could just tell they were all sad it happened.”The woman never reported the incident to the Office of Student Ethics, Paslaski said. But the University acknowledged that it found out about both the theme of the party and the alleged rape, Kish said. The University heard about the party theme through an email from an IU employee but did not specify how it found out about the sexual assault.ATO’s disciplinary probation was extended until May 31, 2015, for alcohol-related violations. The ATO executive board banned the party for good.Paslaski was a pledge at the time, so he didn’t attend Ménage as a member. He said he hated being associated with the theme, and agreed wholeheartedly the chapter needed to put a stop to it.Although the alleged sexual assault involved an individual member, Schmeckebier said it was a wake up call for the entire chapter.“ATO shares some responsibility for creating an environment where that can happen,” Schmeckebier said.Ménage was extreme, but Paslaski said it is not the only fraternity party on campus that promotes a sex-related theme or encourages women to wear revealing clothing. What about Roman Orgy? Office Hoes and CEOs? Workout Bros and Yoga Hoes?“Our greek system has too many themes that call girls whores and sluts,” Vechiola said.Paslaski’s former human sexuality professor Debby Herbenick invited the fraternity president to speak on a panel about sexual assault to a class of high school students at Bloomington High School North on Thursday morning.With prom and the Little 500 approaching, Paslaski talked to students about staying in groups, watching how much they drink and knowing when they need to intervene at a party.“If you see a girl who’s clearly too drunk, or if you see a guy who’s being creepy with a girl, it is your job to step in and do something,” Paslaski told the students.He told them about a night when one of his female friends called him from a bar in Bloomington, asking for help. She said she felt threatened by a man who seemed to be putting pills in her drink, Paslaski said. Paslaski picked her up and brought her home.The ATO president is used to being protective of women — he has been looking out for his three younger sisters his whole life. Now he’s on the other side, keeping an eye on his brothers.Chapter 6It is about 10 p.m. on a Saturday in February at the ATO house, and the basement party is already filling up.Paslaski has just returned from a workout and is stretching in the living room. The sober monitors and pledges are all assigned to their posts: front door, back door, bar and crowd watcher.In the basement, the brothers take shots and play beer pong with the girls, and others watch the IU basketball game. One guy drinks from a beer bong while music blasts from the speakers.It snowed earlier, and the more people walk in, the more slippery the stairs become. A girl in crutches holds onto her friends as she struggles down the stairs in her high heels and birthday sash.“Someone’s gonna eat shit on those stairs,” one brother says. A pledge quickly finds paper towels. Another liability and potential injury is dodged, this time.A couple of nights earlier, at about 5 a.m., a police officer knocked on the door. The officer told Paslaski that a student was found passed out in a stairwell at the Helene G. Simon Hillel Center, next door. The student, who told the officer he was an ATO pledge, was arrested for trespassing and illegal consumption and possession.Paslaski says the student was never an ATO pledge, and the student refused to speak to the Indiana Daily Student. ATO received no apparent consequences of the arrest. Paslaski simply hoped it would be the last time he would have to speak with cops.It wasn’t. The chapter got a noise complaint during a party a few weeks later. During the course of three weeks, one girl pulled a fire alarm, a group of girls drew with Sharpies on the walls in the basement, a girl kicked a hole in a wall and another girl broke a $900 table.Paslaski filled out invoices charging the girls with property damages, then moved on to his next task.Little 500, the riskiest week of the year, is right around the corner. On Friday, Paslaski and his risk management team plan to meet with Kish and with members of Zeta Tau Alpha, the sorority ATO is paired with for the week of parties.He’s going to lay out the rules, such as using single entrance points in the house and keeping partygoers out of the formal living room.“Of course things could happen out of my control, but I’m going to do what I can now to prepare,” Paslaski said. “That’s the only way you can survive Little Five.”If ATO can keep a clean record — at the very least until Little 500 — it will be a huge milestone. They plan to hire a disc jockey and host a concert in the back parking lot to \\r\\ncelebrate.The next goal is to make it to the 100th anniversary of the chapter house in December. It would feel like ATO was truly back for good.Until then, the president starts off every chapter meeting by saying, “Another week off probation!” And the brothers always cheer.Article published 04/17/15',\n",

       "  'body': 'This Monday will bring about the second annual “Cupcakes and Condoms” event, which will be hosted from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the Frangipani Room in the Indiana Memorial Union.Last year, Cupcakes and Condoms gave out more than 2,500 condoms and 700 cupcakes by 3 p.m. They will have 5,000 condoms and more than 700 cupcakes to give out this year at the event, which has been extended by ?an hour.Graduate student Jasmine Utterback said they want the event to be inclusive of everyone on ?campus.“We want to reach students of all orientations and identity,” she said. “That’s why it’s great to be partnered with the GLBT Student Support Services Office.”Deshea Meely, a senior at IU, said the Gay Straight Alliance will be heading the event and the partners made sure that Cupcakes and Condoms will be all-inclusive for students of any sexual identity or orientation who want to ?come stop by.The IU Student Association, which funded the event, also has partnerships with organizations such as the Gay Straight Alliance at IU, GLBTSSS, the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, Raising Awareness of Interactions in Sexual Encounters, the Residence Halls Association, Masters of Public Health Assembly, IU Health and Wellness and Union Board.The event is stop and go, which means anyone can stop by in between classes and look at the different stations provided without going through all of them.Meely facilitated the partnership with the Kinsey Institute to get the historical aspects through the ages for Cupcakes and Condoms stations.Debbie Herbenick, Ph.D. associate research scientist, will be at the event to speak to and answer questions for those who attend.There will be multiple stations provided with information and things to do, including tables on sexually transmitted infections, partner conversations in the relationship, condom demonstration with and without drunk goggles that make it seem like day or night, condom artifacts from the Kinsey archives and more.A consent table will be another one of the stations available where people can stop by and participate in the event.Utterback said most times consent is associated with sexual assault but should be discussed in regards to all sexual activities. This station, as well as others, will give participants the opportunity to practice real life ?encounters.She said the idea behind Cupcakes and Condoms is to figure out what information college students do and do not know and fill in the gaps.“It’s fun and interactive,” Utterback said.There will be a station where students can customize messages on the outside of condoms and a kind of photo booth, Utterback said.“We want everyone to have the skills that we need for sexual health,” she said.Pictures are welcome to be taken at Cupcakes and Condoms. You can use the hashtag #IUCupcakes_Condoms2015 with pictures you post on social media from the event.People can follow the event on Facebook: Cupcakes and Condoms and IU, Instagram: IU_Cupcakes_Condoms and Twitter: @CupcakesCondoms.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Be the fat penguin — break the ice.During Tuesday night’s Men Against Sexual Assault and Rape event, self-proclaimed “Dating Doctor” David Coleman encouraged audience members to make the first move.After seeing Coleman speak previously, MARS director Bill Phan, Sigma Alpha Mu member Brian Singer and Interfraternity Council Vice President of Membership Development Jesse Scheinman invited Coleman to present during Sexual Assault Awareness Month.“A lot of the issues that happen are because people don’t know how to have a healthy relationship,” Phan said. “If we’re able to provide the knowledge on that, then it’s a cause and effect situation. If we’re able to stop the cause and help people, then it’s more of a preventive measure than reactionary.”Before his program began, Coleman looked out at the audience and made one simple request.“If you know someone who’s unlucky in love, dating the wrong person or who hasn’t been on a date since Moby Dick was a guppy — text them and tell them to come,” Coleman said. “You’ll thank me tomorrow.”Coleman’s lecture on healthy relationships, break-ups and hook-ups has made him the first public speaker to earn the Entertainer of the Year award by Campus Activities Magazine.His fun, interactive and engaging style made Coleman the perfect fit for the MARS event, Scheinman said.“Ladies, please stand if you’ve ever used your phone to get out of talking with a guy,” Coleman said.Laughter erupted as half the room stood.Coleman outlined how to determine if someone is worth pursuing within five minutes with the ABCs of initial interest: Attraction, Believability, Chemistry and Desire.Coleman told audience members to be vocal and participate whenever they had a question about love, relationships and sex.“Just say, ‘David, I need some advice,’” Coleman said.Audience members asked what to do if they and a friend have the same love interest and if it’s ever smart to get back together with an ex.Coleman had easy steps and acronyms to answer every question.For break-ups, Coleman suggested following the D.A.T.E. guidelines: distance, activity, time and exit on your own terms.Coleman had another eight steps to tell if you’re being hit on and clues to look out for cheating partners.Coleman also helped foster conversations about a culture of consent as he pointed out Sexual Assault Crisis representatives in the audience.“When you hear all these negatives sometimes you don’t want to talk because you feel like you’re going to be wrong,” Phan said. “But if you’re talking positively and you’re making people feel like they’re safe and comfortable, then it’s a lot easier to talk.”After the initial 90-minute Dating Doctor lecture for both men and women, Coleman had a separate session for greek men called Generating Gentlemen.“Having David Coleman run this event will have a lot of people realize that being a gentlemen is not just pulling a seat out for a lady or opening a door for a lady, but it’s much more than that,” Phan said.Above all else, Coleman said he wanted audience members to leave with a positive self-image. Instead of looking for a partner to complete them, students should look for someone to complement them, Coleman said.

       "  'body': 'Sexual assault awareness isn’t the issue; the issue is sexual assault acceptance. As a college student, it is nearly impossible to go through your freshman year without getting talked to about sexual assault ?awareness.From the moment we go to orientation at IU, we are taught about sexual assault and all the repercussions that can come from it. We hear so many stories of sexual assault happening around the country that we begin to accept it.Instead of realizing what a horrendous thing it is, we too often hear about it and think, “Oh, that poor person,” but we don’t actually do anything about it.Sexual assault is an issue we all need to stand up for and say we won’t accept it, no matter what. Sexual assault is happening on our campus.I’ve heard personal stories of young women who have been assaulted, and a lot of the time, they don’t feel the situation got handled correctly. A lot of times, sexual assault stems from sexual harassment, which isn’t always dealt with ?properly.If an individual feels they are being harassed, they need to feel that the school will do everything in their power to stop this harassment.Nobody should just accept or ?endure the harassment or assault.They should feel supported enough by their school that they can reach out and get the help ?they need. When an individual doesn’t feel supported, it is likely they will suffer even more from the situation.They have already lost the power in the moment the assault ?happened, and getting them back to a place where they should feel empowered should be our number ?one goal.Yes, the campus does a good job at bringing sexual awareness to the attention of the University, but we need to put more of a push on making people realize assault should never be accepted.Cassi Le-Huecllehue@indiana.edu406 B E 20th StreetBloomington, IN',\n",

       "  'body': 'A victim reported being raped on the IU-Bloomington campus after attending a party Saturday afternoon, according to an IU ?Crime Alert.The victim reported having consumed a beverage at the party and experiencing memory loss shortly after, according to the alert.“The victim went to a party on campus and got to a state to where there was a loss of memory and not really knowing what was going on,” IU Police Department Lt. Craig Munroe said. “When the victim did recover awareness, there was a male subject sexually assaulting the victim.”The rape was reported to have occurred the afternoon of April 11.The suspect is described as a white male about 5-foot-9 to 6 feet tall with brown hair. He is described as weighing about 200 pounds, according to the alert.The exact location of the incident was not released by police as part of a new policy from IU. Recently, the University is only using general descriptors of sexual assault locations to protect the confidentiality of victims, Assistant General Counsel Aimee Burkert Oestreich told the Indiana Daily Student on March 27.The policy is based on community feedback and concern from victims of sexual assault protecting their identities.The alert gave tips on reducing the risk of sexual assault by giving consent, being aware of personal safety with alcohol and looking out for one another. Perpetrators of sexual crimes are more likely to assault someone they know, ?according to the alert.Any information about this crime can be reported to IUPD at 812-855-6706 or to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS(8477).Storme Dayhuff',\n",

Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault brought Coleman as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.Coleman, also known as “The Dating Doctor” and “the real life Hitch,” has spoken at more than 2,500 college campuses, conferences, singles’ organizations, churches and corporations, according to Coleman’s website. Much like actor Will Smith’s romantic comedy character, this real-life Hitch will dissect why pickup lines fail, how to tell if someone is really into you and the ABCs of initial interest.Coleman will start with a 90-minute presentation about healthy relationships, dating long-distance and breaking up. The session will later break up for MARS members and focus on the male perspective and expectations involved in hooking up and dating.The first portion of the event is free for greek and non-greek men and women because preventing sexual assault and building positive relationships affects all students, MARS President Bill Phan said.“You see it all across the world, not just on college campuses and not just with greeks,” Phan said. “We want to make sure people understand that this is something we want to work with the community on to solve this issue.”In addition to Coleman’s lecture, MARS is also hosting a screening of “The Hunting Ground.” The documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and highlights rape on college campuses and problems with student rapes being reported properly.The film will be screened at 7 p.m. Wednesday in the Whittenberger Auditorium. A discussion panel will follow the film with members from Culture of Care, Union Board, MARS, It’s On Us Campaign, IUSA, Panhellenic Association, Feminist Student Association and Safe Sisters.Lindsay Moore',\n",

       "  'body': 'On Sunday, Columbia University released a 12,866-word investigative report into “A Rape on Campus” the controversial November 2014 Rolling Stone article about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia.Rolling Stone commissioned the report itself when, upon publishing the story, the Washington Post uncovered details about the assault that suggested the incident couldn’t have possibly occurred the way ?Rolling Stone reported it.The report indicates that, as Gawker reporter Gabrielle Bluestone puts it, “Rolling Stone screwed up in basically every way ?possible.”The report speaks to just how difficult it is to report on sexual assault.And with the growing prevalence of news around sexual assault on college campuses, it’s only getting more difficult.Mainstream media coverage of sexual assault ?creates the misconception that it’s a fairly new ?occurrence.But this is untrue.Just because it’s only recently getting media attention doesn’t mean that it’s only recently begun ?happening. Media outlets are aware of this, and, rightly so, they’re giving it even more attention as a kind of reparations for having ignored it in the past.Because of this, what happened with the Rolling Stone piece could begin to happen to even more stories about campus sexual assault.With investigative reporting such as this, getting the story out quickly and efficiently can cause fact checking to suffer.It’s also easy to gloss over some of the finer details of a situation to report on a broader truth.Say, for example, you’re a reporter covering a story about an alleged sexual assault, much like Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the writer of the aforementioned Rolling Stone article.When interviewing the victim, you must be extremely cautious to make sure to convey that one, you believe and trust him or her, and two, that you toe the line in a way as to not inadvertently cause the survivor to relive that trauma so badly that he or she decides to not give you the story ?at all.It’s in these finer details where the reliving of the trauma can occur.So a sympathetic reporter might avoid these seemingly unimportant details so as to not cause the victim to suffer any more.The truth that the victim was assaulted is out there, so why worry about the details anyway?It’s difficult to refute this logic. But a reporter as experienced as Erdely — she’d been contributing to Rolling Stone since 2008 — should have known better.Still, I can’t blame Erdely that much for her ?mistakes. The same thing could’ve happened to any journalist. When you’re dealing with something as heavy as sexual assault, it’s easy for this ?to happen.You want so badly to believe the victim and, in doing so, you overlook things that don’t make as much sense as they should.It’s a shame that this happened like this because it rendered the entire story as false when it’s possible that wasn’t ?the case.But this is only a minor setback.It’s imperative that coverage of sexual assault in the media continues because only then will we be able to fight it.zipperr@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Hunting GroundA“The Hunting Ground” from its very title is a straightforward and aggressively critical examination of rape culture in the United States, especially as it pertains to college students.Written and directed by the Academy Award-nominated Kirby Dick, the documentary offers heart-wrenching first-hand accounts of sexual assault survivors and their collective fight to not only end sexual assault but also change the conversation surrounding it.From beginning to end, “The Hunting Ground” is a call to action.I write this review as a journalist and a college student, but I write it first as a woman. A woman who came into college three years ago understanding full well that there was a one in five chance of being sexually assaulted during my time here. A woman who came to college knowing the buddy system was going to be my best bet to get home safely and the pepper spray on my IU lanyard was going to be my first line of defense.“The Hunting Ground” is one of the most important films any college student or parent will see this year. Sexual assault is a story worth telling, and this documentary does it better than I’ve ever seen.The film’s moments of weakness, however, come from the same coin as its strengths. It quickly becomes clear that what you’re watching has a clear, no-holds agenda. It is advocacy filmmaking at its best: emotional, inventive and divisive.It pinpoints specific benefits that each rung of the collegiate system stands to gain from underreporting or under-prosecuting campus rape cases. The schools, the film’s experts argue, first have an obligation to protect themselves and the image of the institutions they represent.The documentary cites statistics of schools’ lackluster rape statutes from coast to coast, including one from IU.“The Hunting Ground” makes it quite clear that everyone wins in cases of sexual assault, except for the assaulted.The film argues that fraternities tie alumni and their donations to the universities. The athletic departments’ complicity in silencing these cases is because of the huge investment they make in these athletes and the multi-million dollar industry that depends on their playing time.From time to time, the rhetorical devices used in “The Hunting Ground” are a bit heavy-handed. The film opens with clips of students responding to receiving acceptance letters from their dream schools. The movie quickly offers an almost violent juxtaposition to the tears of joy and excitement by setting it up against the realities that primarily await women on college campuses.One of the main subjects, Annie Clark, said, “The first few weeks I made some of my best friends. But two of us were sexually assaulted before classes even started.”One of the most compelling parts of the documentary was the effort to include voices and stories of men affected by sexual assault. Though the film asserts the number of cases of assault reported by men are nearly infinitesimal, it was critical to the point the filmmakers were trying to prove: The patriarchy is a violent, often unapologetic purveyor of violence, and anyone can be left victimized in its wake.In the end, this film is a message to colleges and universities nationwide and to the institutions that allow sexual assault to go under reported and unprosecuted: People are paying attention. It is a message to those administrations that the women who are raped on their own campuses deserve security as well.It is a reminder to the survivors of sexual assault that there is a network of advocacy and support out there working to ensure that another student won’t one day have to share the same campus with their attacker.Ultimately, “The Hunting Ground” demands an answer to the question: Shouldn’t all students be protected?',\n",

       "  'body': 'April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, a time to raise public awareness about sexual assault and educate communities about how to prevent it.Sexual assault is a major public health, human rights and social justice issue. It ranges from verbal sexual harassment to unwanted sexual contact. Every 107 seconds, another American is sexually assaulted. There are an average of 293,000 victims (age 12 or older) of sexual assault each year.The impact is wide-ranging and long-term. Its trauma affects individuals, families, friends, partners and children. It has an ?impact on schools, workplaces, neighborhoods and religious communities. We know it must stop. But can one or two people do it?The answer is a resounding “yes.” The Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence says one way to do it is simple ... we need to talk about it.The conversations we have can keep sexual violence from happening in the first place. Conversations shape those relationships and eventually impact our culture.If we have conversations about consent, healthy sexuality, gender norms and respect, our relationships and the environments in which we live, work, learn and play will be safer and more supportive, protecting us from sexual violence risk factors.Let’s talk about consent. When sex is consensual, it means everyone involved has communicated their desires, needs and level of comfort with different sexual interactions.Let’s talk about healthy sexuality. It means being comfortable with our bodies, having respectful relationships and respecting the rights of others. Talk about gender norms. Respect others. Be aware of the impact of family, cultural, media and societal messages. Interact with all genders in respectful and appropriate ways.Talk about respect. Respectful relationships are based on affection, friendship, trust, good communication and equality for ?everyone in them.We need everyone’s help to end sexual assault.

       "  'body': 'Culture of Care partnered with the Kinsey Institute Tuesday for a discussion about sexual consent during drunk hookups.Justin Garcia from the Kinsey Institute and Leslie Fasone from the Dean of Students office hosted “Drunk Sex: Finding Boundaries” as part IU’s involvement in the “It’s On Us” White House Initiative. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden launched “It’s On Us” in September to address and help prevent sexual assaults on college campuses across the nation.The discussion began with an interactive survey in which Garcia asked the audience to choose its definition of “hooking up.” Survey results from the audience proved the definition of “hooking up” is ambiguous amongst college students .Dr. Garcia continued by showing how the culture has changed in the last decades.“What’s different now is the way we talk about it outside of relationships,” Garcia said. “It’s much more in the medium now. There’s so much discourse about it among youths.”Dr. Garcia presented additional surveys from his own research, including the motivations behind hook-ups. The survey showed that one-third of college students considered their most recent hook-up unintentional and were impaired by alcohol or drugs at the time. This survey introduced issues with consent during impairment.According to IU’s definition of sexual consent, a person is unable to give consent under the influence of drugs or alcohol.Consent must be expressed through mutually understood words or actions to both parties, and either party can withdraw consent at any moment. Additionally, consent cannot be assumed based on silence or the absence of denial.“Bloomington is a quintessential college environment,” Garcia said. “Sexual activity occurs across the continuum of pleasure, consent and sobriety, which includes both positive and negative experiences and outcomes. Our job is to understand the variety of those sexual and romantic experiences and help make them better and safer.”Garcia also brought the human nervous system to attention when addressing a person’s response to assault. He said it is human nature to freeze in certain situations that are traumatic. Consent cannot be assumed in situations in which a person does not say no or fight back.“It’s On Us” will continue through April in adherence of Sexual Awareness Month. Up next on Culture of Care’s calendar is “ConsentFest” starting April 6.Culture of Care is a student-run, faculty-supported group on campus aiming to spread compassion and redefine what it means to be a Hoosier — which Culture of Care defines as “A person who demonstrates care through action; someone with the courage to care,” on its website.Within this organization are four committees: Drug and Alcohol Awareness, Sexual Well-being, Respect and Mental Health. Director of Sexual Well-being Grace Lidinsky-Smith emphasized the organization’s efforts toward safety and comfort for students on campus.Students can participate with Culture of Care through the “get involved” index on its website. The link leads to a questionnaire to determine which committee might interest the student.Fasone identified the mutual goals of both organizations to create a safe environment on campus, teach the definition and boundaries of consent and prevent sexual violence.“Many of our efforts are collectively about changing this culture,” Fasone said. “Bottom line, if you’re engaging in sexual activity, you need to make sure you have consent.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'On April 8 and 9, students will be berated with fliers, handouts, buttons, sunglasses and platform talking points.Yes, it is that time of year. IU Student Association elections are upon us again.Last year, I ran with PLUS for IUSA, an unopposed incumbent ticket that made waves with its charismatic, progressive team.The PLUS Administration, headed by President Andy Braden, has made large strides in reforming Counseling & Psychological Services, forging new partnerships to lower textbook prices and expanding ?student outreach.With the PLUS ticket I ran for Congress, where we’ve passed legislation to provide free psychiatric care for survivors of sexual assault, to create more gender-neutral restrooms on campus and to allow students who may be transgender or non-binary conforming to use their preferred name on their student ID.This year’s ?administration has been the most productive administration in recent history.As someone who ran with PLUS, I know firsthand the leadership that has bettered IUSA during the past year.Now, there ought to be a disclaimer on this column.This year, after being approached by both INTouch and Amplify — two tickets of the three tickets running for IUSA this year — I chose to support Amplify.This year, as students approach the polls, I urge them to keep three words in mind — progress, experience, and stability.In regards to progress, Amplify has a platform of realistic, attainable goals it has already begun ?working on.If elected, its team pledges to hit the ground running. Meanwhile, INTouch and Unify, the third ticket running for IUSA, have policy points that are often broad or vague ?in nature.Amplify also has a ?combined 10 years of IUSA experience on its executive slate, overpowering both INTouch and Unify.Unify, specifically, has zero experience with IUSA, which could prove ?crippling to the ?administration.INTouch has some experience, but still less than Amplify, proving Amplify by far knows best how to work the ropes of a new ?administration.Amplify has also maintained a stable, ?experienced team since day one.Unify actually had its past chief of staff, Sam Strong, drop from the ticket. She has since been replaced by Stephen Moors, a freshman with no experience in IUSA.Additionally, the INTouch ticket had its vice president of Congress candidate, Ty Nocita, drop from the ticket to be replaced by Jalen Watkins as recently as last week.Overall, Amplify for IUSA is a ticket that is ?brimming with experience, knows how to walk the walk of an executive administration and has remained strong and focused as ?a team.I wholeheartedly believe in this ticket’s ability to create a stronger, better, more student-centered IUSA, just as it has been ?doing for the past year.There is a reason I chose to support Amplify for IUSA instead of INTouch for IUSA — I believe that, in this case, experience and focus can better the student body more than broad promises.I am voting for Amplify on April 8 and 9 because I want a better IU for future Hoosiers.I’m #Amped to be working with and supporting the best ticket in this election.ajguenth@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Thursday brought a debate between three IU Student Association tickets: Amplify for IUSA, INtouch for IUSA and UNIFY for IUSA.Each ticket had three minutes for opening statements, followed by responses to six questions.What are the three most important issues facing campus?Candidates from all three tickets agreed sexual assault is the most important issue facing campus.“Certainly sexual assault is by and far the pressing issue that our campus faces,” said Andrew Ireland, UNIFY for IUSA presidential candidate. “It is an epidemic, and it must be stopped.”What sets his ticket apart from the other two, Ireland said, is his ticket’s focus on affordability.“We face a crisis today in higher generations of students that face so much debt that they are looking at 10, 15 years to pay it off,” he said.To address affordability, Jack Langston, UNIFY for IUSA vice president of congress candidate, said the ticket hopes to eliminate tuition payments for internship credits and donate executive salaries to a textbook fund.Nick Laszlo, Amplify for IUSA presidential candidate, said his ticket emphasizes cross-cultural development.Laszlo has said the ticket hopes to introduce Skype sessions between incoming international students and current students, allowing incoming international students to ask current students questions, and forming an international student advisory board.Wes Cuprill, INtouch for IUSA treasurer candidate, said his ticket’s focus on ethics is what sets it apart.“I was an executive on the (Interfraternity Council), and we heard complaints a lot that the student ethics board was often very slow, not very transparent and often very intimidating,” he said. “So we want to work with the university to completely revamp that process.”He said the ticket hopes to make the student ethics board more transparent.How would your ticket increase student involvement?Ireland of UNIFY for IUSA said increasing student involvement starts with building the campaign, particularly with putting together a diverse and representative ticket.“If we really want to go and prove to students that it’s worthwhile voting within this election, that it’s worthwhile pursuing this, you have to put up a great slate of candidates and you have to put up a progressive policy platform,” he said. “And we’ve done just that.”Ireland added that IUSA must be a transparent and accountable organization.Laszlo of Amplify for IUSA disagreed. He said that while transparency is important, engagement is more so.“Simply telling students what you’re doing is not enough,” he said. “You must find ways to make students more interested in IUSA, and that’s how you’re going to get higher voter turnout.”Laszlo said the current administration, of which he is a part, has already taken steps toward increasing engagement through the introduction of moving speaking tours and student voice surveys.Anne Tinder of INtouch for IUSA said her ticket would take further steps toward increasing student engagement by introducing an opt-in email.“Our vision for this is a weekly email from IUSA that fills students in with what we’re doing, the progress we’re making, what we’re spending their money on,” she said.Should a student government speak out on federal, state and local issues?Laszlo of Amplify for IUSA said a student government should speak out on federal, state and local issues.“Everyone on the executive team, or everyone in IUSA in general, should be mindful that, as a student in IU-Bloomington, you’re not only being affected by the policies that President McRobbie says or the policies that Provost Robel says,” he said.Tinder agreed.“It is definitely the student government’s responsibility to advocate on behalf of these issues as well,” she said. “I think we’ve seen this on IU’s campus recently with Freedom Indiana really taking hold on campus. That was very much a student-run initiative on this campus.”Ireland of UNIFY for IUSA, however, disagreed.“We are a representative body,” he said.“We ought not to be taking sides in political issues. We ought to be working with the state house and the federal government when we can push policy that concerns student advocacy, but at the same time, we shouldn’t be meddling in divisive issues of the day.”Additional debate questions were addressed in a previous story which can be read on idsnews.com.',\n",

The female appeared to be highly intoxicated. The male said he had seen her running, naked, and tried to help her. He said he ran after her and offered his shirt, since she seemed cold. He told police that the female seemed ?“intoxicated, not making much sense and in distress,” Capt. Joe Qualters said.Officers discovered the female had met another male on the dating app Tinder earlier in the evening. The two had agreed to meet. The female said the last thing she remembers is standing outside of the Dunnkirk bar, and there is a large amount of time she cannot account for. It has been verified that the male who gave her the shirt is not the same male that she met on Tinder.Officers took the female to the hospital for a sexual assault exam and for her intoxication. She was initially cooperative with the sexual assault exam, but then did not want to complete it, according to the report.She was examined and treated for her intoxication, Qualters said.Officers attempted to locate the female’s clothing but could not find it. According to the report, the female made contradictory statements about the events of the night.She was able to provide BPD with the first name of the male she had met on Tinder.“As far as we can tell, there are a lot of gaps in the story,” Qualters said.

       "  'body': 'In an effort to combat sexual assault and its stigma within the greek system, fraternity and sorority members met to discuss solutions.The sorority group Safe Sisters, which acts as a liaison and support system for sorority members who have experienced sexual violence, and its fraternity counterpart Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault (MARS) had a collaborative meeting to discuss sexual assault prevention methods within the greek system.Sexual Assault Crisis Center counselor Debbie Melloan and other SACS representatives were present to help answer questions and facilitate discussion.“Tonight was really historical,” Melloan said. “A lot of people have been invested in making campus and the two organizations who are represented here places that people can come and feel safe and work together and tonight really is the realization of that.”Nearly 200 Safe Sisters and MARS representatives were split up into discussion groups based on their sorority-fraternity pairs for Little 500, Panhellenic Vice President of Membership Development Bella Shuh said.This allowed members to meet each other beforehand in safe, sober environments to discuss topics such as sexual violence, bystander intervention and sexual assault reporting. The groups were also Little 500 affiliated because the race and the following celebrations often require increased risk management, Shuh said.“Little Five highlights a lot of those topics and increases risk in a lot of ?senses,” Shuh said. “These topics have needed to be talked about for so long.”Safe Sisters and MARS used conversation starters from IU’s It’s On Us Summit that took place last week. The discussion prompts encouraged members to look forward and focus on improving greek culture, Interfraternity Council Vice President of Membership Development Jesse Scheinman said.Amongst the popular discussion prompts were questions that addressed greek life’s current culture, perception and what chapters would like their future legacy to be. When members joined a larger group discussion at the end of the session, several groups noted the greek image both in the media and from non-affiliated students was often negative and based off of specific events or stereotypes.“What you see in the news when chapters get kicked off for things like hazing or sexual assault, those aren’t representative of what it means to be greek,” Scheinman said. “They’re not living their values, and they’re not serving the original purpose of why greek organizations are here.”To combat those who fail to live up to greek values, MARS director Bill Phan suggested changing the culture of a chapter from ?within.“A lot of times you are in a greek organization where things are already in place, everything’s already there, everything’s already tradition,” Phan said. “Because it’s tradition you’re going to continue doing it. The times when fraternities actually improve are when one person challenges it.”Safe Sisters co-director Dylan Lanoff encouraged the larger group to not only embrace change in the culture but to be vocal about it.“The negative things that happen in greek life that people hear about are very loud and overt and out there but the good things that happen tend to be not as overt and loud and in your face,” Lanoff said. “It’s important to encourage these MARS and Safe Sisters members to make that push and be loud and overt about the good things that they’re doing.”Having both the sorority and fraternity perspective present also made discussions of sexual assault less confrontational or judgmental, Lanoff said.“I think it’s important that we came together to talk about this so we understand that we want to work together,” Lanoff said. “We’re not blaming men for sexual assault. We’re blaming the people who sexually assault.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Artist and educator Dean Adams began his presentation by telling the audience his work isn’t what most people are used to seeing.“A woman at one of my past presentations glanced at a photograph of one of my sculptures,” he said. “At first she thought it was a bird, but then she realized, ‘My God, that’s a penis!’”The presentation, titled “The Art of Being Male,” took place Tuesday at the IU Fine Arts Building. The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction sponsored the event.Adams, the foundations coordinator at Montana State University, combines his skill of ceramic art with humor in illustrating sexual ?masculinity. His works mainly include penis-shaped sculptures combined with aspects of nature, such as birds.Although he mainly works with ceramic art in depicting sexual masculinity, Adams said he doesn’t limit himself to a single medium with his profession.“I want to make positive sexual icons, meaning that I want to shed a positive light on the masculine side of sexuality,” he said. “Male sexuality in today’s culture is defined through hypermasculinity, which doesn’t encapsulate the full being of an individual.”Adams said he uses a sense of humor to get people to think about how sexuality functions in their daily lives.Adams said he wants to help people become comfortable with their sexuality.“I want people to either consider or reconsider the role of sexuality in their lives,” he said. “Letting people engage in issues of sexuality and combining it with humor allows people to lay their guards down.”Combining his humor with talks about sexuality allows people to let down their guards, he said.Nathan Davis, a former employee of Montana State University and friend of Adams’, was in attendance at the presentation and said Adams is “like a ninja” with his craft.“It’s amazing to see him keep doing what he’s doing,” he said. “Even though he’s so good at the ceramics aspect, that’s not what he likes to talk about the most.Adams said his interest in sexuality was triggered at a young age from his mother’s work; she started the first Rape Task Force in his hometown of Billings, Mont.Hearing stories from his mom about women being assaulted and raped by men made Adams afraid of his own sexuality.He overcame his fear by confronting it with art and humor, he said.Adams said he wants his work to give people a new outlook and awareness of sexuality in an affirmative way.“Being able to openly talk about sexuality is healthy,” he said. “Using humor just makes it easier.”Adams ended his presentation by saying he wasn’t the first person to combine humor, art and sexuality all into one process.“I am not the first person to put wings on a penis nor to put penises on a bird,” he said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Five years.That’s the amount of time a victim of sexual assault or rape in the state of Indiana has to charge an offender before the case legally has to be thrown out.A new piece of legislation just cleared the Indiana House of Representatives on Tuesday that provides victims of rape and sexual assault with an extension in the amount of time legally available to prosecute offenders.Senate Bill 94, which was authored by Indiana Sens. Michael Crider,R-Greenfield; Ed Charbonneau, R-Valparaiso; and Brent Steele, R-Bedford, would increase the current statute of limitation in instances of rape under certain ?circumstances.A statute of limitation is a law that prohibits prosecutors from charging an individual with a crime outside of a specified period of time. The aim of these kinds of laws is to ensure convictions can only be made using evidence that has not deteriorated with time.The statute of limitations in instances of rape would be extended an additional five years if the state first discovers DNA evidence that is sufficient enough to charge an offender or if a person confesses to an offense.The bill passed unanimously in the House with a vote of 97-0.Crider authored the bill with the intention of offering a sense of peace to victims of sexual crimes.“My bill will extend the statute of limitations by an additional five years if there is a confession, or if new DNA evidence is identified,” Crider said in a press release. “My hope is that this legislation will not only give victims of these types of crimes some closure, but the opportunity for justice, which does not exist if the facts come forward outside the current five-year statute of limitation.”In Indiana the current laws state that for Class B, Class C or Class D felonies, charges for an incidence of rape cannot be filed more than five years after the alleged incident occurred.Rape becomes a Class B, Class C or Class D felony if an offender knowingly has sexual intercourse with another person without the victim giving his or her explicit consent.Indiana Rep. Christina Hale, D-Indianapolis, proposed an amendment to the legislation Monday while the bill was open for debate in the House. Her goal was to protect victims whose perpetrators might have recorded or documented their rape.“One very positive thing is that people are getting caught for these crimes today and they’re being prosecuted,” Hale said during her testimony. “But it’s also an awful fact that people are, in fact, documenting these crimes. I would suggest to you that in 10 or 20 years there will be people that find out that in dark places on the Internet ... their image or a video of them or parts of these crimes are being broadcast in ways that they never would have imagined.”The amendment dictated that the five-year extension to the statute of limitation would be granted if “the state first becomes aware of the existence of a recording that provides evidence sufficient to charge the offender with the offense.”Hale’s amendment was passed with a vote of 90-0, meaning the bill will return to the Indiana Senate for concurrence in the amendment before being sent to Gov. Mike Pence to be signed into law.Indiana isn’t the only state that has restrictions on the statutes of limitation in instances of rape.There are 19 states that have no statute of limitation in rape cases, but in the other 31 states and in Washington D.C., the statutes of limitation range anywhere from two to 20 years, some with various loopholes and exceptions that further complicate the ?process.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Kappa Delta Rho fraternity at Penn State is now under investigation after a private Facebook page belonging to the fraternity was discovered. The Facebook page contained pictures of nude women who appeared to be unconscious and were posted by fraternity ?members.A special task force was created specifically to investigate these allegations. Penn State University president Eric Barron released a statement about the investigation, which implies they are taking this situation ?seriously.Meanwhile, students are rallying and asking that those who are members of the Facebook page not be given their degrees. Although this might appear to be a harsh punishment for the members, it is completely proportionate to the wrongfulness of their conduct.Many fraternity members may go on to be leaders of businesses and our coworkers after earning their degrees. These postings completely support rape culture. If these men feel comfortable enough to post unauthorized nude pictures of women, they have the ability to make even worse, detrimental decisions.I do not want somebody who was affiliated with an organization that has posted nude picture of women online without consent to be my boss or my coworker later down the road. It would make many women feel ?unsafe and uncomfortable.Therefore, not granting the offending members their degrees would be ?appropriate.In the past few years, many issues and scandals among fraternities surrounding sexual assault seem to have been swept under the rug. The serious matter in which Penn State is approaching this horrific event is refreshing. It gives all students, especially women, hope for protection and equality.In addition to this, it demands that fraternities respect women more than they have in the past. Fraternities are very influential organizations and an essential component to campus life. When their actions do not reflect their core values, especially when it comes to the treatment of women, it is important they suffer ?consequences for it.This might improve the decisions made among fraternities. If fraternities choose to show women respect in their conduct, it can have a positive effect on the whole campus.There have been many scandals recently involving fraternities posting ?offensive material to social media sites. These fraternities need to remember who they are representing before posting anything online.Their decisions in real life and the material they post online represents both their universities and organizations. The consequences for posting inappropriate material should be harsh because they are misrepresenting thousands of students and fraternity members.Fraternities and universities need to start taking sexual misconduct seriously. Penn State’s decision to do that is encouraging, although it is sad that it needs to happen. This is a good step towards creating respect for women across all campuses.eshrack@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Hannah painted the Greek letters across her friends’ bare chests and butt cheeks.“RUSH AEπ.”An Alpha Epsilon Pi pledge had been challenged to convince a girl to paint his fraternity’s letters on her chest for a photo. Hannah and her four freshman friends agreed to help.Hannah had never heard of “Rush Boobs” before, but it sounded fun and harmless. With yellow acrylic paint, Hannah drew a Star of David on her friend’s butt cheek — a fitting detail for the traditionally Jewish fraternity.She wasn’t comfortable being photographed at first, she said. But when she saw that her friends would be anonymous, she joined in.Why not? She thought. It would never come back to her.Because Hannah’s chest was smaller than her friends’, she decided to have her butt cheeks painted. The girls lined up in the Wright dorm room, alternating every other — three with their chests painted, two with their butt cheeks painted.A sixth friend took the photo,which was cropped to exclude faces, and texted back to the AEPi pledge.The pledge never specified how the photo would be used, and the girls never asked. The photo was soon forgotten. But later, the girls wondered:Who saw our Rush Boobs?***The fraternity tradition of Rush Boobs often happens during pledgeship\\xad — the time between accepting a bid and getting initiated into a chapter. In order to impress brothers, pledges are asked by individual members of their chapter to find women willing to show their bare chests.All of the women interviewed who participated said it was their choice to take the photos. Those who agreed often wanted to help out a friend and were not drunk or pressured into doing so.Other women declined and found the request for Rush Boobs offensive and objectifying.The University knows this trend exists online and at other colleges but not among IU students, said Melissa Kish, associate director of Student Life and Learning, which oversees greek life.“We have no reports to indicate this is happening or an issue at IU,” Kish said in an email.Despite this, the Indiana Daily Student found a number of IU fraternities accepting and distributing Rush Boobs photos. They have been used as tasks for pledges, currency between brothers and advertising for potential new members, according to online photo galleries and interviews with students.Interfraternity Council President Sam Snemis said he has seen photos online from other schools, but IFC has not received any complaints related to Rush Boobs at IU.“I haven’t seen it prevalently used on this campus,” Snemis said.Snemis said the tradition undermines the sexual assault prevention reform the IFC is promoting. Depending on the circumstances, Rush Boobs could be considered both hazing and sexual harassment, but this would be decided and handled by the Office of Student Ethics, Snemis said.Both greek and non-greek women are asked to do Rush Boobs. If sorority members were to participate, they would be violating Panhellenic code of conduct, Panhellenic Association President Margaret Hensley said in an email.“This activity not only serves to objectify and degrade both the women participating in it and sorority women in general but involves women in the fraternity recruitment process, which we do not allow,” Hensley said.Rush Boobs has branched out from being a national chapter secret to a national phenomenon through the website TotalFratMove.com, which claims to have “the definitive collection of Rush Boobs.” Schools from every region of the country, including IU, are represented in these photos.In the last year, photos were submitted with symbols representing IU chapters for Theta Chi, Delta Upsilon and Alpha Tau Omega. Each of these IU fraternities were identified based on chapter names or the IU logo. They were the only clearly identifiable IU chapters on TFM, as most photos do not include specific chapter or school names.After learning about Rush Boobs on IU’s campus from the IDS, the IFC addressed the issue at a meeting with fraternity presidents, Snemis said.“Images of these nature create an expectation for women — or from the guy’s standpoint — that women would do this kind of thing,” Snemis said.Delta Upsilon President Quin Carroll said his chapter does not condone any use of DU letters in an inappropriate fashion, including the photo posted on TFM.“While we cannot control what is posted on the Internet, under no circumstances have we ever encouraged or accepted these behaviors,” Carroll said in an email.Theta Chi President Charlie Peters said his chapter does not condone the use of Rush Boobs either.Women also reported being asked by members in Delta Kappa Epsilon, Pi Kappa Alpha and Alpha Epsilon Pi. Presidents from DKE, Pike, AEPi and ATO did not comment on the matter.All photos are cropped and edited to exclude faces. For this reason, the women and men who have participated and spoke to the IDS asked to be identified only by their first names and without any affiliation with their greek chapters.Women are agreeing to take these photos at IU and across the nation, but it is unclear if they have consented to their photos being online or if they have any idea their photos have gone further than a text message.Sharing Rush Boobs online is a new trend, but the thought behind it is not, according to gender studies experts at IU. It reflects the cultural norm of using women’s bodies for the viewing pleasure of men.It also demonstrates how men are often pressured to relate to one another through their access to women, gender studies Ph.D. candidate Jocelyne Scott said.This phenomenon raises questions about college culture: Why are college women agreeing to strip down for fraternity brothers? Why are fraternity men being asked to get women naked to impress their brothers? What does that say about our expectations of men and of women?***Gavin, a sophomore fraternity member, went through pledgeship last fall. Individual brothers assigned members of his pledge class tasks — Rush Boobs was a popular choice.Gavin crafted a lengthy text explaining his task. He first asked his girlfriend at the time, but she hesitated, not wanting his fraternity members to see her naked. Instead, he asked another close friend, who agreed. Asking for the photo wasn’t awkward, Gavin said.“It’s not just some random chick,” Gavin said. “It’s a girl who understood the situation and accepted it.”He then sent the photo back to the brother who requested it. Gavin did not share the photo with other brothers and did not post it online.“It would be really stupid to do that,” Gavin said. “At least in my fraternity, that person would be immediately removed. This is already on the fence of whether it’s appropriate or not, but that would be the most ungentlemanly thing ever.”***With no faces or names affiliated with Rush Boobs, participants feel detached from their photos. Anonymity makes the thrill of doing something “wild” seem safer. Women said they felt more comfortable knowing they were doing it with friends or to help a friend.The photos also have a liberating and exciting appeal for some freshman women.“For me, I’m a freshman, so I’m just out of the house, and I know this sounds stupid, but now I can do whatever I want,” Hannah said. “So let me do something stupid, like being naked in a picture for a frat, because I’m in college.”In a culture of “Girls Gone Wild”, sexual freedom can be misunderstood, gender studies senior lecturer Jennifer Maher said.“That’s what makes me the saddest,” Maher said. “There’s much more to sexual freedom than being able to flash your tits.”Women on TFM make their Rush Boobs stand out with flattering filters, occasional stripper poles and even puppies. It is a cultural norm for women to be praised based on their physical appearance, Maher said.“Is that what we want young women coming into IU to think about as their greatest value?” Maher said.***Last fall, junior Jaylee White was home recovering from appendicitis when a member of Pi Kappa Alpha asked her what she thought of Rush Boobs. Not knowing what that was, White asked him to elaborate. The brother explained the tradition of writing on women’s chests. Before he even asked her, White refused.“I said, ‘Honestly, if you’re willing to ask anyone to do that, you are repulsive, and you should probably reconsider what you’re asking,’” White said.The Pikes brother later apologized. Having known him since freshman year, White said she was surprised he had brought it up. It made her think differently of her friend and of campus culture as a whole.“It’s sad that no one is saying anything about it,” White said. “Everyone’s just consenting to it. I don’t think that’s cool. Especially not with IU, because we’re so anti-sexual assault, and we have so many sex policies we’re trying to pass, and we’re so gender neutral. I don’t like it. I don’t want that on IU.”Rush Boobs gives the wrong impression of greek life as well, sophomore sorority member Courtney said. She declined to participate when a brother in Delta Kappa Epsilon asked her last year. Courtney requested her sorority not be named.“It would feel wrong using your body to promote one fraternity over another because when it comes down to it, greek is greek,” Courtney said. “Is your fraternity really better because you got more girls to show you their boobs?”Courtney said she also felt taking the photo would be a poor representation of herself. The promised anonymity of Rush Boobs wasn’t enough to convince her.“I think our generation has this thing where (we think) nothing bad can happen to us,” Courtney said. “No one will see your face, but what if someone steals your phone, or you lose your phone and someone gets on there and sees that I sent you that?”Trusting that a Rush Boobs photo gets from point A to point B with no interception is never guaranteed.***For Jas, who participated in AEPi’s photo with Hannah, the only lingering question is: Who will see that photo?“I don’t know what they did with my picture,” said Jas, who requested that she be referred to by her nickname. “That’s sort of just in the back of my mind, like they still have it, what are they going to do?”Some photos reach a much larger audience through Total Frat Move, whether the participants and chapters know it or not.TFM has been curating its Rush Boobs photo gallery for two years. With an average of 30 to 40 photos posted weekly, the site has already accumulated nearly 2,000 pictures. In January 2015 alone, TFM received 3.2 million views, according to website traffic estimator SimilarWeb.Fraternity members who wish to contribute to Rush Boobs can simply sign up with their name and school. There is no screening process on TFM. Submissions are completely up to the discretion of the individual who posts them, said Kelsey Heineman, customer relations director for TFM’s parent company Grandex. Users are giving TFM consent to use their photos however the company sees fit.Just upload, submit and become part of Internet infamy.Among these photos are a handful of Snapchat screenshots, one of which was carefully captioned, “These go viral your dead.” This implies that not all the photos posted were intended for the public eye.It also raises the question of whose property the photo is and what defines consent in the digital age.For the five freshman girls, the discussion of Rush Boobs stayed within the walls of their Wright dorm room. But looking back, Jas said she still wonders where that photo went.“I would want to know what they did with it,” Jas said, “just because those are my boobs.”',\n",

Mark Stoops, D-Bloomington, to become the Cascades Inn.Stoops, who is operating in a private capacity, said he hopes to open the property located at 2601 N. Walnut St. to guests in as early as a month.“It’s on a bluff that overlooks Cascades Park,” Stoops said. “I just watched that hotel over the years. It’s a really busy, successful place.”In addition to its last iteration as the privately operated University Inn, the site has formerly housed EconoLodge, Ramada Inn and Holiday Inn franchises.The property, originally built by Holiday Inn in 1963, offers easy access to Memorial Stadium and State Road 37, ?lying north of campus traffic.Initial opening goals include finishing renovations of 14 of the hotel’s 100 rooms and having the dining room and bar completed, Stoops said.The new Cascades Inn will enter a crowded innkeeper’s market in Bloomington, with Hyatt, Hilton, Holiday and Fairfield, among many others, offering hotel services with chain brands.Additionally, the Indiana Memorial Union serves to provide lodging for IU guests.Cascades Inn will differentiate from other hotel chains by offering a local flavor, including local food sourcing and recycling in every room, Stoops said.“I don’t think there’s a hotel with quite as nice of a natural spot,” Stoops said.Despite the competition, tourism is big business in Indiana and Bloomington, with $10.3 billion in economic ?activity coming to the state from the industry in 2013, as previously reported by the IDS.A single Big Ten football game can bring in anywhere from $3 million to $5 million for the Bloomington area, according to Visit Bloomington, the Monroe County tourism agency.The inn has four buildings and a clubhouse, as well as parking.In its final days, the ?University Inn served long-term tenants, and, due to its former owners’ neglected upkeep, the property will require extensive renovation efforts.General wear and tear required leak repair and repainting, Stoops said.The Bloomington Department of Housing and Neighborhood Development is permitted to inspect all hotels for compliance with safety regulations, according to the Bloomington Municipal Code.Alleged prostitution, ?sexual assault, robbery and child mistreatment were some of the problems that occurred at the former University Inn before its shuttering in 2013, according to IDS archives.Turning over a fresh leaf from its past owners, the new hotel will house short-term renters, Stoops said.The Monroe County ?Alcoholic Beverage Commission granted Stoops a beer, alcohol and liquor permit last Wednesday for the hotel’s bar.Stoops purchased the property through Mast Investments LLC for $1.95 million in November 2014, according to Monroe County property records.“Along with changing the name, we’re changing the look and feel, as well to fit with the natural setting of the property,” Stoops said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'After Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston was let go of all charges related to the campus rape, journalist Walt Bogdanich stepped into a 1 1/2-year investigation about rape on college campuses.Walt Bogdanich, three-time Pulitzer Prize winner and New York Times investigations editor and reporter, discussed investigating sexual assault on college campuses Tuesday at the Whittenberger Auditorium in the Indiana Memorial Union.Bogdanich shared stories and lessons learned from starting his investigation of campus rape and why this field of journalism is necessary in this time of technological influence.“Investigative journalists have a low threshold of indignation,” Bogdanich said. “Getting lashed out on is considered an occupational hazard.”Bogdanich recalled the time he was part of a $6 billion lawsuit filed to him by a powerful company, according to Bogdanich, Philip Morris Cigarette Company. The company was suing him for libel for discussing the addictive qualities of nicotine.Bogdanich discussed how these addictive qualities were manipulated by the company to sway customers to think otherwise of the health risks associated with cigarettes. The lawsuit ended when Bogdanich was able to prove all the points he posed.To be an investigative journalist, Bogdanich said he is guided by two unwavering principles. One is the information that he needs is written down somewhere, he just has to find it. The second part is every person that has the information he seeks has a motive to give it to him.“You must be creative, be sensitive, but don’t be passive.”? Bogdanich said.Starting the investigation into campus rape was described as venturing into an emotional minefield.Bogdanich focused on how well the institutions tasked with these cases dealt with them and with other ?institutions.As the university became more worried of the story, it motivated Bogdanich and pushed him even more to pursue his investigation.When his article on the rape case surfaced, neither the school nor police liked the portrayal of their institutions but didn’t deny any facts stated.Following this story, sources began to contact Bogdanich about different cases — one case involving a girl at a private university.After gaining the trust of the family Bogdanich was able to get a transcript of the panel that the victim had to approach to report her rape claim on campus.Bogdanich revealed insufficient investigations carried out by the school to rightfully prosecute the person at fault in the rape case.After this case, Bogdanich referred to himself as a member of “CSI: New York Times,” breaking the rumored idea of the slow death of investigative ?journalism.“This is not an ideal world, you must find the best obtainable truthful report,” Bogdanich said.Reporting in the perspective of Bogdanich goes beyond the guilt or innocence of the victims, making it frowned upon to use fake names at all costs and always reach out to the accused.“Great journalism stirs people to action,” he said.The lecture was the second event this semester as part of the Media School’s speaker series.',\n",

No toilet stall is safe from a ?University definition of sexual assault.Can we please rethink this ?strategy?I find sexual violence a very troubling issue on this campus and support informing as many people as possible about University policies related to sexual violence, but I find it equally troubling that a person could walk into a toilet stall, pull down their underwear, and be forced to read about sexual violence.Toilet stalls are private spaces, not rape education centers. Recently, an updated policy on sexual violence was released by ?University officials.It seems the posters may need to be updated to include new ?information.I propose a modest solution to the issue of forcing men and women to look at a sexual assault policy while sitting on the toilet: move the posters from the toilet stalls to the general bathroom areas.Move them any place where I don’t have to be half-naked. In general the campus continues to make great efforts to educate ?students about sexual violence.However, the posters seem reflective of a few administrators who are more concerned with enforcing policies than appealing to sensibilities.I believe these administrators have an authentic desire to be helpful and represent the University in a positive light, yet policies that invade a person’s privacy reflect poorly on the decision-making of the administrators responsible.It seems unlikely that someone who understands trauma would ?advocate for such a policy.

       "  'body': 'Aaron N. Anton Lee, 21, of Bloomington was arrested Sunday night on preliminary charges of rape, criminal confinement, intimidation and auto theft, according to a Bloomington Police Department arrest report.Lee reportedly raped a female, who was a friend of a friend, after the victim went out to the bars, and later Night Moves, with friends, Lt. Brad Seifers said. The female told officers she doesn’t remember where the alleged sexual assault occurred.Lee and the woman were in her vehicle Sunday night. At one point he told her that he would harm her if she tried to exit the vehicle, Lt. Seifers said. She eventually got out of the car, and Lee took off. She didn’t have her phone with her, and a couple reportedly saw her walking along the road and took her home, where she contacted the police.The woman was transported to the IU Health Bloomington Hospital for a rape kit.Officers located her vehicle on the 500 block of South Basswood Drive, where they found Lee. In the officers’ interview with Lee, he said the two had consensual sex, but he had no explanation for why he took her car.He was subsequently ?arrested.Andy Wittry',\n",

       "  'body': 'The things we do to women in this country.For all the progress we have made in recent decades — Roe v. Wade, increasing equal protection in the workplace, greater access to education and breaking down many long-standing stereotypes — we still haven’t gotten over the hump.Sure, equal pay and sexual assault awareness have been the next populist frontiers of the feminist movement, but a great tragedy still prevalent today is the rising prices and increasing restrictions for women to receive abortions.In January, the Guttmacher Institute released a report that revealed in 2014 alone, 335 new abortion restrictions were introduced in legislatures across the country and 231 new restrictions have been enacted in the United States since 2010 — a significant increase in similar legislation from the two decades prior In the state of Indiana, access to a safe, legal abortion services has grown more difficult, and for some, prohibitively more expensive.Whether it be more intrusive methods of shaming women out of their decision, requirements for multiple exam visits, limited access to local care or skyrocketing costs, the state, like many across the country, has taken an active role in degrading women in their most vulnerable hour.As of Nov. 1, 2014, Indiana state abortion restrictions include state-directed counseling with information that is designed to encourage women from having an abortion, an 18-hour waiting period before the procedure, a mandatory ultrasound and abortion pill restrictions.Anti-abortion advocates will claim this is simply an attempt to enlighten women to their options before making an irreversible decision, but the Editorial Board believes the government has no place making moral calculations of this nature for its citizens.As President of College Democrats at IU Hannah Miller explains, “It is important to remember that people do not plan to have an abortion. It is not something anyone wants to do. It is something that at times is medically, financially or psychologically necessary. Forcing people to go through with a pregnancy they don’t want is unjust and cruel.”Regardless of what advocates of these restrictions might say, forcing women into a pregnancy is exactly where their intentions lie. Further, it is a decision that has no place being judged in the public sphere.No matter what an individual’s personal feelings are, the decision to get an abortion is one which should remain solely between doctor and patient. If we want to prevent abortion, our focus should be on preventing unwanted pregnancies in the first place.“The best way to reduce abortions is to reduce accidental pregnancy, not creating socioeconomic barriers for people who are already pregnant and seeking an abortion,” Miller said. “The most effective way to reduce unintended pregnancy is better access contraceptives and particularly for teens, better sex education.”The Editorial Board agrees with this sentiment and urges lawmakers to admit this is not solely about abortion but also about making a moral and political difference.It’s time we stop shaming women, the poor or our most vulnerable citizens. It is time we treat everyone with the dignity they deserve, and that begins with breaking down institutionalized discrimination of all kinds.',\n",

INtouch for IUSAAnne Tinder, the ticket’s presidential candidate, said the ticket’s platform, the five Cs, tackles five broad areas: Counseling and Psychological Services, campus safety, collaboration, creating a conscience and conduct.Ty Nocita, the ticket’s vice president of congress candidate, said the ticket hopes to increase the number of free counseling sessions CAPS currently offers to those who have paid the IU Health fee. CAPS currently offers those who have paid the fee two free ?sessions.“These departments are doing as much as they possibly can with the resources they’ve been given,” Tinder said. “So I think our job, more than changing specific policies, will be urging the University to prioritize resources differently.”Tinder said the ticket plans to enhance student safety by creating a Global Information Systems map of the campus that identifies areas of concentrated crime.To increase collaboration, Tinder said the ticket hopes to improve myINvolvement to make the database of student organizations easier to access ?and use.Tinder said the ticket plans to extend the freshman orientation curriculum throughout freshman year, allowing freshmen to better relate to the topics that the curriculum addresses.Nocita said the ticket also hopes to make the student organization ethics board more transparent and standardized.“I was not planning to be involved with IUSA at all my senior year because I had not felt particularly supported in or excited by my roles in the past and because I was not convinced that next year’s implied administration would do a better job,” Tinder said.She said she changed her mind when Nocita approached her.“This team has clear goals and could articulate them well, even from day one,” Tinder said. “When they presented their ideas to me, I was truly inspired and believed in them, too. It’s amazing how much they care and how quickly I’ve grown to care about these topics, as well.”Meet the CandidatesAnne Tinder,?Presidential candidateJunior majoring in philosophy and political science and participating in the Liberal Arts and Management Program.Goal?“I hope to turn the IUSA office from a sprawling, loosely-connected network of committees to a robust team of leaders cohesively working toward our goals. Of course, I want to advocate for the student voice and implement our platforms, but I want to have as many students directly involved in that process as possible.”Tatiana Padilla,Vice President of Administration candidateSophomore majoring in law and public policy and minoring in Spanish.Goal“The toughest part shouldn’t be getting elected. Our efforts shouldn’t stop once the polls close. Instead, that should be only the beginning. My goal individually is to maintain my dedication to our platforms, keep myself and the team accountable to our campaign promises and surpass my teammates’ expectations of me throughout our term.”Ty Nocita,Vice President of Congress candidateJunior majoring in Arabic and political science with a certificate in political and civic engagement.Goal“It is no secret that IUSA has a representation problem. Of the marginal portion of students who are aware that they even have a student government, there is a considerable segment that view it as a ‘closed game,’ specifically for people who know the right people. INtouch has made a point to come to student organizations to find ambitious and diverse representatives of IU’s entire community.”Wes Cuprill,Treasurer candidateJunior majoring in supply chain management.Goal“I hope to work closely with other student organizations on campus to implement effective campaigns and programs that tackle issues ranging from sexual assault prevention to student health. I want to see a greater sense of collaboration and community between student organizations at IU.”The deadline for tickets to formally announce their intention to run is Monday March 9.Candidates must register by 5 p.m at the Student Life and Learning office in the Indiana Memorial Union.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Laughter, silence and deep breathing were taught to campus mentors as coping mechanisms Wednesday in the La Casa Latino Cultural Center.“The expectation that we can be immersed in suffering and loss daily and not be touched by it is as unrealistic as expecting to be able to walk through water and not get wet,” said Zelideh Martinez Hoy, director of Student Diversity and Inclusion at the School of Public Health.She was reading a 1996 quote from Rachel Remen on compassion fatigue. Martinez Hoy said it is impossible for mentors to help students through traumatic experiences and not be transformed or touched in a way by the process or the stories they share.Graduate Mentoring Center Director Maria E. Hamilton Abegunde organized a session that allowed mentors to come together for a discussion on compassion fatigue.She invited students and members of service providers on campus to be involved in a discussion of compassion fatigue, identity and how identity affects the compassion fatigue mentors feel.Martinez Hoy first asked attendees to gather in smaller groups and create individual “social identity doughnuts.” They were provided a worksheet with a circle on it. The participants were then instructed to divide the circle into several different pieces where each piece represented a part of their overall identity.After coming together as a group again, Martinez Hoy led a discussion that allowed participants to explain their partner or group member’s identity and define compassion fatigue in their own words.Hamilton Abegunde said compassion fatigue is when mentors overstress themselves to a point where they are not doing as much as they can anymore.Doug Bauder, director of the GLBT Student Support Services office, said he sees compassion fatigue as a positive thing. It’s about knowing one’s limits and how much campus mentors can do, he said.“I think if there is a positive side to it, it’s just being aware that one human being can only do so much,” he said.Stephen Amundson, a graduate assistant for the Career Development Center, said he also doesn’t take a negative approach to defining compassion fatigue. He said he feels that, as mentors, they sometimes become overly compassionate.“We’re compassionate towards people in that we give them the support they need,” he said.He said at the same time, they need to challenge the students to break through obstacles on their own. He related this concept to the proverb where instead of fishing for a man, one teaches the man to fish, and he will eat for the rest of his life.The group took an intermission after the first section for pizza and wings. When they came together again, they delved deeper to look at the way their identity affects their compassion fatigue.Martinez Hoy told the group that, in her personal experience, hearing sexual assault cases had a lasting effect on her.“It was not something I left on a paper,” Martinez Hoy said. “I carried it with me.”Martinez Hoy talked about “self-care strategies” at the end of the session. She offered a list of ways for mentors to be aware of their personal awareness while helping those who are going through traumatic experiences.Martinez Hoy used the metaphor of a backpack to describe the responsibilities each individual wears and learning when to take it off.She said identifying personal role-shedding rituals is important as well as learning not to carry that backpack all the time. She said physically changing out of her clothes from the day and into her sweatpants and comfy clothes is a “role-shedding ritual” for herself.Martinez Hoy also opened up discussion for mentors to share their own ways they cope with the effects their students have on their lives.Hamilton Abegunde said taking the time to sit, be mindful and breathe is beneficial in the midst of chaos. Martinez Hoy paused from the discussion and instructed everyone in the room to take in a deep breath and then let it out as a group.“Isn’t it interesting how, when you take that deep breath, you become kind of lighter?” she said. “I don’t know, maybe it just has that effect on me.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'IU adopted a new sexual assault policy Sunday that illustrates the prohibition of all forms of sexual harassment and sex- and gender-based discrimination, which, includes rape, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, sexual exploitation and stalking.The policy serves to provide information on how to report sexual misconduct allegation, information on resources and assistance, and procedures on addressing assault reports, according to an IU press release.University Vice President and General Counsel Jackie Simmons said IU found a good balance with the installation of the new policy.“This was a cooperative effort that was given a lot of thought and time to plan,” she said. “Most effort went into how we wanted to protect the rights of victims, how to make sure they get the right care and how to protect the due process rights of the perpetrator.”Simmons said the policy will act as a road map for everyone involved with sexual assault cases. It will provide information about the process and how it’s carried out. She also said implementing the policy was important for the nationwide issue in general.“Part of it was the whole national discussion of sexual assault on campuses and how important the issue is for everyone to be aware of,” she said. “The federal government had put out guidelines as to what sexual assault policies should include. Our campus wanted to do more with it.”According to the press release, the policy was installed with the ultimate goal of creating a safe and supportive environment for students, faculty and staff.“Indiana University is thoroughly committed to the safety and well-being of all members of the university community,” IU President Michael A. McRobbie said in the press release. “This policy makes clear that we take sexual misconduct very seriously and that we will respond promptly and appropriately when misconduct is reported. The staff and faculty who worked long and hard to create the policy deserve our thanks.”Counseling and Psychological Services at IU hosts help sessions through their Sexual Assault Crisis Service for assault victims. Director Nancy Stockton said the policy should have a positive effect on victims’ outlooks.“It should make victims feel more comfortable,” she said. “Knowing the University is looking after their best interest and following cases up as robust and fair as possible will make a difference.”Chief Student Welfare and Title IX Officer Emily Springston said in the press release there was a need for a policy that better spoke and informed the community about sexual misconduct.“In addition to providing clarity for students, faculty and staff, the policy demonstrates our commitment to complying with all federal and state laws and guidelines on sexual misconduct,” she said in the press release. “It ensures most importantly that we are collectively responding to reports in a prompt and effective manner.”The role of University employees reporting incidents of sexual misconduct is also included in the policy, as well as the IU Police Department for addressing them, according to the press release.Simmons said the new policy will hopefully encourage sexual assault victims to come forward because they will be more knowledgeable about its features.“They will know what the process of carrying out a sexual assault case looks like and how it’s handled,” she said. “We want to further encourage students to take a stand.”',\n",

The plan is published on the ?provost’s website.“The IU-Bloomington Bicentennial Plan represents both a path to excellence for the dawn of our third century and an appreciation for the strengths, people and distinctive culture that brought us to this point,” ?she said.Robel first spoke of the progress in educational ?initiatives on campus.Throughout the address, Robel mentioned the creation of the most recent IU schools, including the Media School and the School of Global and International Studies.Senior Anu Kumar is majoring in both journalism and international studies. She said she attended the address to learn about developments being made, especially in the Media School and SGIS.“I have kind of an investment in both of those schools as a student leader to see what I can do to ?contribute,” she said.Robel said SGIS was selected as one of five founding institutions of the Carnegie International Policy Scholars Consortium, a program that connects students and faculty from different universities to prepare students for their careers in ?international relations.SGIS is in the process of conducting faculty searches, Robel said, and classes are to start in the new building this fall.Robel said the Media School’s progress includes the hire of its founding dean, James Shanahan, and the approval of two undergraduate degrees in media and game design.Kumar said she was impressed with the reported progress of both schools.“I thought she gave a great review of all the initiatives that are taking place,” she said.Robel said the plan also calls for campus allocation of resources to support diversity in science, technology and mathematical fields.She said the Center of Excellence for Women in Technology, an initiative that supports women in technology fields, is making ?great strides.“CEWIT has already engaged over 350 faculty, 2,000 students, over 400 staff members and close to 500 alumni around the simple idea that technology fields should be inviting to ?women,” she said.Robel also addressed the possibility of an engineering school at IU. She said a committee of faculty members has been formed to assess the benefits of an engineering program.Beyond educational endeavors, Robel mentioned several successful campus initiatives to promote diversity and student health and wellness.She highlighted the ?efforts of IU Culture of Care, a program focused on respect, sexual assault, alcohol and drug abuse, and ?mental health.“The initiative is truly becoming a campuswide effort in engagement and collaboration,” she said.She said the program will connect with the greek community this spring to assess the houses’ adherence to their stated missions and values.To address initiatives promoting diversity, Robel highlighted IU2U, established this year to engage IU’s international student population.She said IU2U sent a group of students, faculty and staff abroad last summer to host a two-day event for incoming IU students and their families in Beijing to foster connections between current and international students before they step on campus.The program will expand next year to host events in Beijing, New Delhi, Shanghai and Seoul, South Korea, Robel said.Robel said the State of Campus address could not cover the entire Bicentennial Strategic Plan or all of the efforts being made to promote aspects of the plan on ?campus.“It is intended to be a call to pride in our collective mission and to our powers of generative thinking,” ?she said.',\n",

To do so, he said the ticket hopes to introduce new ?community events.To address sustainability, Laszlo said the ticket plans to suggest implementing dark hours and installing more motion sensors, as well as switching to more energy-efficient exit signs and beverage machines.Sohee Kwon, the ticket’s vice president of administration candidate, said the ticket hopes to address three aspects of personal health: mental health, sexual well-being and campus safety.Rather than introducing new mental health services, she said the ticket hopes to expand on and advocate for current mental health services, including IU Counseling and Psychological Services, Sexual Assault Crisis Services, Crimson Corps and Culture of Care.To address cross-cultural development, Laszlo said the ticket plans to introduce Skype sessions between incoming international students and current students, allowing incoming international students to ask questions. They also hope to form an international ?student advisory board.Considered the incumbent ticket, Amplify for IUSA, Laszlo said, has learned from both the successes and mistakes of past administrations.“You realize what has made other administrations successful, and you also realize what challenges have faced other administrations,” he said. “When you look at our platform items as a whole, what you’ll ?realize is that we’re not doing things that can’t be implemented because we’ve had experience with things that couldn’t be implemented in the past. We know what works and what doesn’t work.”Nevertheless, Kwon said, adding a fresh perspective also benefits the ticket and its platform.“Everyone in our administration is currently in IUSA,” she said. “As for me, I’m kind of on the outside of IUSA as the co-chair of Culture of Care. And since we are the incumbent ticket, it is beneficial to have someone on the outside of the administration also be on the ticket to add a new perspective to the administration and to IUSA itself.”Meet the candidatesNick Laszlo, presidential candidate, is a junior majoring in finance and entrepreneurship.Goal: “I hope to create more opportunities for IU students to interact with the Bloomington community and to experience all that this great campus offers.”Sohee Kwon, vice president of administration candidate, is a sophomore majoring in elementary education.Goal: “Through my experience in Culture of Care, I have noticed the need for students to be connected with the resources IU has to offer us as students. I’d like to see more attention on these resources and their dissemination.”Zack Farmer, vice president of congress candidate, is a junior majoring in economics and minoring in marketing.Goal: “I hope to help raise awareness of IUSA’s Congress and representatives. Representatives have the opportunity to advocate for large issues seen by the student body, and I’d like to empower them to use this opportunity as a way to positively impact campus during their time at IU.”A.J.

       "  'body': 'IU has made a lot of strides this year in its efforts to improve itself as an institution of higher learning.Students and administrators came together to enact such wonderful policies as IU’s new preferred-name policy, which allows students to change the name listed on their student ID card, if they so desire.There have been efforts to change how we look at sexual assault as a community, which revised CAPS policies that are under negotiation as we speak. CAPS has gotten a reboot to be faster and more efficient for students who need help.Our brothers in the greek community have stood up against sexual violence with the creation of the new Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault program. The University has committed itself to fighting sexual violence and protecting those who need it most.The Residence Halls Association has stood up to support the implementation of more gender-neutral housing options for first-year students.These are all tremendous accomplishments and should not be minimized in any way. That’s not the purpose of my column today.It has been evident to me in the past that, after a period of change and improvement, students and citizens become complacent in the status quo. People like the way things are going and, thus, don’t see any reason to continue fighting for change.This complacency is nothing more than stagnation under disguise. And stagnation will ultimately lead to the rot of our successes and our way of life.I fear these successes will lead to students no longer fighting for positive change at this university. I fear that the administration will no longer be challenged and students will no longer be compelled to act in their own self-interest.This isn’t to say there aren’t positive forces of change here at IU. Student groups will always continue to push for change. I am more concerned that specific areas, such as mental health, sexual violence and LGBT issues, will remain stagnant in the future.It is incredibly easy to reach success and then stop fighting. We must fight this collectively as a society.I write this not to bash any accomplishments, as they are all great acts of selflessness. However, I am urging my fellow students and citizens to not sit complacently while there is more work to be done.When I look forward into the future of this university and this city, I see new avenues and paths that need our attention. Yet I also see older paths, those such as sexual violence or transgender discrimination, which need our utmost attention as well.I fear that instituting new gender-neutral housing in one residence hall will lead to the abandonment of the ultimate goal of having gender-neutral housing available in every residence hall.I fear having one LGBT-themed floor will lead to the perception that we no longer need to strive to make all floors LGBT-friendly.I fear all of these potential outcomes, along with many others. I want to improve the lives of others. I want to create a university where we solve problems, not postpone them. I want to create a society where everyone can walk down the street without feeling fear.These goals aren’t achieved with complacency. They are achieved through action.I urge you all today to never stop fighting for a better world.ajguenth@umail.iu.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Adding alcohol to the equation of sexual assault and consent often leaves students in a gray area.Students on the Sexual Assault Task Force and other student organizations met at the Dean of Students’ office last night to discuss the relationship between alcohol and sexual assault on campus.The focus group was led by Devon Malick, an intern of Culture of Care, Dean of Students office and the drug and alcohol information center, OASIS. Malick will be working to pilot a curriculum based around sexual assault prevention. The focus group was shown the New Zealand-based video “Who Are You?” which focused on bystander intervention.The video featured a night out for two friends that began with a pregame at a friend’s house and progressed to a bar scene. Throughout the video, different bystanders were identified: the friend, the stranger, the bartender and the roommate.As the video progressed, no bystanders intervened. At the end, the night was set in reverse to show what each bystander could have done preventatively.The future curriculum would be based off a video similar to “Who Are You?” set at IU.The focus group was asked for suggestions on how to make this video relatable to IU students. Students suggested adding a variety of scenes of where sexual assault could happen including dorms, house parties, fraternities and bars.Sophomore Carmen Vernon, Feminist Student Association treasurer, suggested that switching the focus from bystanders to the perpetrator would be effective in changing the culture of sexual assault.“I’d like more emphasis to be put on perpetrators, whether they’re men, women, trans, whatever gender,” Vernon said. “I feel like we focus a lot on bystander intervention, whereas if we just learn to respect each other’s bodily anatomy I feel like a lot of these situations ?can be avoided.”It was also noted that the video focused on a perpetrator who was a stranger to the victim. Vernon suggested adding a scene where the perpetrator was an acquaintance.“You don’t want to box it in and say ‘this is what sexual assault is,’” Vernon said. “You want to show that you can be sexually assaulted by ?someone you know at a party.”73 percent of rapes committed were by someone the victim knew, and 38 percent of rapists are known by the victim, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.Perpetrators are not ?hiding in the shadows; they’re friends. Victims are not wandering into dark alleyways; they’re neighbors.Culture of Care and other preventive programs work within student groups to change how they think about sexual assault within their specific communities.This is more effective in generating discussion for ways to intervene and challenge their group norms, Assistant Dean for Women’s and Gender Affairs Leslie ?Fasone said.“Obviously we want to reduce the risk,” Fasone said. “But one of our ways in doing that is to teach people to be active bystanders so that within their group they know when they don’t see ?something, they say something and they do something.”Bystander intervention was introduced because students expressed a need for it, Fasone said. Students continually asked about how to intervene, but what they needed was the confidence to do so, Fasone said.“To really change this culture, I think students have a lot more power than they utilize,” Fasone said. “You guys can make an amazing impact on ?campus.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The IU Student Association is teaming up with the IU Police Department.The IUSA Congress passed two resolutions regarding IUPD and amended another resolution regarding sexual assault at an IUSA Congress assembly meeting Tuesday.Representatives unanimously passed a resolution expressing IUSA’s support of IUPD’s campaign to ensure all 911 communications from individuals located on campus to go directly to the IUPD dispatch.Under current procedures, all 911 communications go directly to the ?Monroe County dispatch, where it is then forwarded to the IUPD dispatch, IUSA Chief of Policy Kevin Kuo said.Furthermore, IUPD cannot receive text messages when students use Text-to-911 and, therefore, cannot respond via text message when students use the service, according to the ?resolution.“When we met with IUPD, they told us that they have had problems with communication because it’s literally a game of telephone where they’re passing on ?information,” Kuo said.The resolution expresses IUSA’s support of IUPD’s campaign to ensure that all 911 communications from individuals located on the Bloomington campus, determined by the location of the individual’s phone, go directly to the IUPD dispatch.“The purpose of this redistricting is to make the line of communication between a student and IUPD more direct rather than changing who’s going to ?respond,” Kuo said.Representatives also unanimously passed a resolution urging IUSA Congress to create a new position, the holder of which would act as a liaison between IUSA and IUPD.“IUPD wants to make sure that we have some sort of permanent line of communication with them,” Kuo said. “It’s important for IUPD to know what students want and it’s important for students to know what IUPD does.”Laury Flint, chief of police for IUPD, requested that IUSA create a position, the holder of which would act as a liaison between IUSA and IUPD, Kuo said.Representatives also amended a previous resolution urging IU Counseling Psychological Services to provide students who have been designated victims of sexual assault with free ?mental healthcare sessions.Though the original resolution did not specify, the amended one states that representatives urge CAPS to provide students who have been designated victims of sexual assault with free psychiatric sessions, as opposed to free individual ?counseling.The original resolution states that victims of sexual assault would receive free individual counseling until a licensed mental health care professional deems the sessions no longer ?necessary.The amended resolution, however, specifies that victims of sexual assault would receive free psychiatric visits until a psychiatrist deems the sessions no ?longer necessary.Though CAPS currently offers victims of sexual assault free mental health counseling through the Sexual Assault Crisis Service, it does not offer free psychiatric visits. SACS, however, will waive fees for psychiatric care if a student is unable to pay and would not turn a student away because they cannot pay, Pete Grogg, director of the IU Health ?Center, said in an email.Furthermore, though CAPS currently offers those who have paid an IU Health fee two free counseling sessions, it does not offer free psychiatric visits to those who have paid the fee.“We just wanted to make sure that we weren’t giving false information, first and foremost, to you guys and to students,” Will Wartenberg, IUSA vice president of congress, said of the ?amendments.',\n",

       "  'body': 'If you have been following along in the news from state legislatures lately, you are probably under the impression that there has been some kind of epidemic of crime on college campuses. Students are organizing protests to allow more guns on campus and to allow concealed carry permits to apply to ?college campuses.And gun rights advocates and legislators are going around spouting theories of how guns can prevent crimes common on college campuses.One of the most prominent organizations, Students for Concealed Carry, was formed in response to the Virginia Tech mass shooting in 2007. It claimed armed students could have helped stop the massacre sooner.This organization, along with one of its executives, IU senior Crayle Vanest, was recently featured in the New York Times for its push to expand concealed carry onto IU’s campus.As Oklahoma State University professor and National President of sexual assault prevention organization One in Four John D. Foubert said in the article, “If you have a rape situation, usually it starts with some sort of consensual behavior, and by the time it switches to nonconsensual, it would be nearly impossible to run for a gun.”The evidence shows rape and sexual assault is not likely to occur in a context that a gun would be useful, meaning sexual assault has no place in the concealed carry debate. This misunderstanding of crime in general, and sexual assault specifically, is why the Editorial Board cautiously stands against this proposal.“The most important thing about concealed carry isn’t the gun,” Miles Vining, President of IU’s chapter of ?Students for Concealed Carry said. “The gun is just a tool, and the tool won’t be useful to you without the right mindset.”Vining also made a point to emphasize the organization’s activities to increase situational awareness and a defensive mindset, which he described as the true virtue of concealed carry.This raises a question of the organization’s priorities. If the true virtue of concealed carry is really in the mindset and not the gun, why not focus advocacy efforts toward defensive training?Training people to be more aware of their surroundings and better prepared to defend themselves could be a legitimate solution many of the issues Students for Concealed Carry is passionate about — but we don’t hear any of them in the policy discussion, nor is this mindset a requirement in obtaining a permit.The Editorial Board is not in favor of meritless bans, but instituting concealed carry while ignoring what the organization itself believes to be the real benefits is just bad policy work.Sound policy is made through identifying a clear problem, evaluating evidence, forming an informed solution and balancing that solution’s costs and benefits.In the eyes of the Editorial Board, Students for Concealed Carry and campus carry advocates have not gone through this process, and until they present a policy that lines up with the priorities they have publicly, we will continue to stand against them.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Indiana is among the 10 states making ostensible efforts to permit firearms at universities. The belief is if guns could be freely carried on college campuses, then women would be protected against rape.This is just a problematic tactic conjured up by the conservative right to use the purity of young women as a bartering chip in the ongoing gun control debate.Beyond its convoluted logic, this argument indicates how so many of the people making decisions about our country are still getting it all wrong where rape and sexual assault are concerned and are even reinforcing rape culture.Such legislation frames rape and sexual assault in this romanticized, Victorian, foggy streets of London way in which a scoundrel Jack-the-Ripper-type stranger moves from the shadows and forces himself upon an unsuspecting and defenseless woman.The reality is most rape and sexual assault takes place between people who know each other and in a setting in which the identity of the perpetrator is already known. Legislators and society need to move past this dark-alley-stranger idea of rape, because it doesn’t occur nearly as often.Besides, if a woman were to be armed with a gun, where would she stash it? What if she’s at a party, doesn’t have her purse nearby and couldn’t have it on her body because her dress is too small? By the way, she should be able to live in a world in which she can wear a tiny dress without having to worry about being ?assaulted in the first place.But here we are, once again putting the burden on the defenders to stop rapists rather than shifting the responsibility to the attackers who should end rape by not raping in the first place.This legislation would only reinforce this unfocused approach to rape prevention.If you don’t believe rape culture is spinning this argument, consider how Michele Fiore, a Nevada assemblywoman and sponsor of a bill to bring guns to campus, said, “If these young, hot little girls on campus have a firearm, I wonder how many men will want to assault them.”Yes, the future female members of our society whom the right is magnanimously trying to protect are “hot little girls” in the eyes of Fiore, which seem to me the predatory words of sickening disempowerment that ?belong in Maxim magazine.Have these proponents considered the escalation that would inevitably occur? People may think armed students would send the message, “Don’t mess with me; I could be armed.”But to those old-timey, dark alley rapists it only says, “You need to be the first one to pull your gun on this person.”This breed of rapists won’t be deterred. The thing about rape is it includes the strategy to avoid consequences, whether that is being ?identified, caught or killed.This is a crime scenario based on power, so rapists target those they feel confident they can rape and then get away with it whether or not they are armed with mace, a knife, a gun or Excalibur.This misguided shred of faux-rhetoric would actually bring guns to campus and still not end rape.Meanwhile, universities would have to deal with the consequences of putting guns in the hands of thousands of large toddlers with better motor skills who are often under the influence of mind-altering substances and have an ?invincibility complex.gmleeds@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': '‘Fifty Shades of Grey’DLet’s start by making it clear. This review is based solely on what happened in the movie “Fifty Shades of Grey,” and I am not taking into consideration what happened in the book or sequels.“Fifty Shades of Grey,” the movie, is a poorly thought-out piece of trash.If you’ve been stranded in a desert for the last three years and haven’t heard, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is a sex-driven romance novel written by E.L. James. It began as a work of fan fiction based off of “Twilight,” so you can imagine the height of my expectations.But instead of writing mopey, sparkly vampires to carry the story so she didn’t have to put effort into crafting interesting characters, James has bondage, domination, sadism and masochism and characters that are still as flat as the pages they’re written on.And now it’s a movie. Thanks, Hollywood.Anastasia Steele is a 22-year-old English literature student in Vancouver, Wash. When her roommate, Kate, gets sick, Ana must take her place in interviewing billionaire businessman Christian Grey.There is some awkward flirting, and an attraction that makes no sense begins to grow. A few sequences later, Christian is asking Ana to be his submissive.Christian is a dominant, an individual in a BDSM relationship who takes pleasure in asserting control over his partner, the submissive. For reasons that are never explained, Christian decides he wants Ana to be his next submissive.Of course, Christian can’t just ask nicely. He slaps a contract in front of Ana, one she must sign in order to have any kind of intimate relationship with Christian. The contract goes into detail defining the terms of their relationship, the types of tools he might use on Ana and the things he can put into her body. It even limits her eating and drinking habits.Ana is not sold on the idea of signing over the rights of her own body, nor is she overly enthusiastic about the idea of letting a man hit her so he can get his rocks off.Still, Ana can’t leave Christian. And though Ana resists signing the contract, Christian continues to see Ana and have sex with her. It’s a lot of back and forth, a lot of “He scares me, but I love him so much” and “I’m no good for you, but I just can’t let you go.” Does any of that sound familiar?If this was a high school drama, that kind of instability would work. But this is two grown adults, and I don’t think I’m asking too much for a little more maturity.Aside from a weak romance, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is full of moral issues.For one, the BDSM concerns me. There is no support for Ana. Christian won’t even sleep in the same room with her. There is no care when a BDSM session ends. Christian leaves Ana to take care of herself. I also don’t like that Christian’s idea of easing sexually inexperienced Ana into a BDSM relationship is to use a riding crop during the third time they have sex.Secondly, Christian is overly possessive and a stalker. He shows up at places to which he has not been invited, and I don’t mean just popping up unannounced at a restaurant. He flies across the country to keep Ana in his sights.Thirdly, there is a matter of child sexual assault that is never properly addressed in the film. Perhaps it is brought up in a future book, but where the movie sits right now, it was grossly misused as an interesting subplot.The only things going for “Fifty Shades” are the beautiful cinematography and a killer soundtrack. The storyline is a nightmare.“Fifty Shades of Grey” is not a love story. It’s a horrific glamorization of an abusive relationship and a reminder that Hollywood producers care little about the effects their products have on an audience as long as their pockets are being lined.',\n",

Four fraternities are currently on disciplinary probation.Alpha Tau Omega is on disciplinary probation, effective through May 31, 2015, for alcohol use, according to a handout from the meeting.Delta Kappa Epsilon is under social restrictions, effective through May 31, 2015, and disciplinary probation effective through December 31, 2015, for alcohol use, according to the handout.Sigma Pi is on disciplinary probation, effective through May 31, 2015, for hazing and alcohol use, according to ?the handout, and Delta Chi is on disciplinary probation, effective through December 31, 2015, for an unsafe environment that resulted in an ?allegation of drugging.“We recognize these as serious issues,” IU Interfraternity Council President Sam Snemis said. “And serious repercussions can come about.”IU Chief Policy Officer Jenny Kincaid and IU Title IX Coordinator Emily Springston also updated the BFC on the new Sexual Misconduct Policy, Title IX compliance and Student Welfare Initiative, the topic of a Feb. 6 ?meeting at IU.Kincaid and Springston particularly addressed the role of employees.Employees fall under two categories: “responsible employees” and “confidential employees.”Responsible employees are required to report any information they’ve received about an incident of sexual misconduct. Professors, advisers and coaches, among others, are considered ?responsible employees.Confidential employees are not required to report any information they’ve received about an incident of sexual misconduct. Mental health counselors and health care professionals are considered confidential employees.“First and foremost, we reach out to that individual and help make sure that they are okay,” Springston said.The BFC discussed potential changes to the online course questionnaire policy.The online survey questionnaire is administered in all courses except for those in which questionnaires must meet national accreditation standards not met by the ?online course questionnaire.The online course questionnaire includes three categories of questions, defined in the proposed changes to the policy: student-access, promotion and tenure and ?open-ended questions.The instructor, the unit’s head of teaching and the students would have access to the responses to the student-access questions.The instructor, the unit’s head of teaching and the department chair or school dean would have access to the responses to the promotion and tenure questions and ?open-ended questions.Additionally, promotion and tenure committees may use the responses from promotion and tenure committee questions when evaluating candidates though the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education and the Education Policy Committee must define the dimension that each promotion and ?tenure question is meant for.Instructors, departments and schools may add their own multiple-choice and written-response questions. They may also replace the online course questionnaire written-response questions with their own ?written-response questions.“Our concern was very much clarity of the policy, making it thoughtful and deliberate,” said Ben Robinson, co-chair of the BFC educational policies ?committee.The BFC has not yet voted on the proposed changes to the policy.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Recently, the IU Student Association created a plan to eliminate psychological service fees for students who have been sexually assaulted. This proposal has been long overdue in the eyes of many students at IU.Sexual assault isn’t something to be taken lightly, and when someone has experienced that type of distress, they deserve whatever help they need.Counseling and Psychological Services is open to waiving off these fees, although there will need to be another source for the psychiatrists’ incomes.Part of this money will end up coming from a portion of the students’ tuition, and hopefully the other part will be from the Dean of Students. Currently, the Dean of Students’ office focuses heavily on prevention, which is fantastic.Unfortunately at IU, not all sexual assault can be prevented. The ?accountability is far too high and there’s likely to be a situation that slips through the cracks. This is why more funding should be granted to organizations like CAPS to ensure free services in order to tend to sexual assault issues that arise on campus.When looking at sexual assault, ?attention needs to be on not only preventative measures, but on current cases, as well.At college, we physically distance ourselves from our family. Although we’re geographically far apart from those we hold closest, a strange bond forms when you can’t hug your mom everyday or get a pat on the back from your dad when he gets home ?from work.There’s no longer yelling about pointless arguments about the high school party you went to last Friday night. At college, you are your own individual, and you should be allowed to make your own choices.But the one thing most of us don’t have under our belt is money. When the going gets tough, most of us turn to our parents to acquire funding for our extracurricular activities.What we don’t want to ask them for is payment for psychiatric care after a sexual assault. Amongst other things, it’s embarrassing and could possibly change the relationship students have with their parents.No kid wants to be seen as a burden to their parents. In students’ eyes, asking for money for a sexual assault counseling session says two things to their parents: one, write a check to erase all of my problems, and two, I don’t trust you enough to go to you in times of need.The truth of the matter is that things do happen. It’s not enough to be preventative in stopping sexual assault from occurring. IU Student Association recognizes that a change needs to surface, and those who have been sexually mistreated need to be noticed and helped accordingly.At the Editorial Board, we understand this is simply a step in the right direction. This isn’t the finish line — in the future, IUSA hopes to address the fees of other programs and departments.The kinds of issues CAPS deals with are the heart of the problems our campus faces — sexual assault, depression and mental health. It’s high time we put these concerns at the forefront of development at IU.The elimination of fees for sexual assault victims at CAPS will be the catalyst for change. All services should be free, and no students should be suffering ?because they cannot afford to seek help.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Rolling out of bed on a late Friday morning, IU senior Arielle Moss woke up with a mission — a mission to raise awareness of domestic abuse and sexual assault.Moss, president of the student chapter of the Middle Way House, partnered with a dance advocacy group, Movement Exchange, to join of the global movement One Billion Rising in efforts to demand justice and change for the one in three women that will be abused in their lifetime.Around 35 participants surrounded the entrance at 12:30 p.m. Friday at the Sample Gates, some holding signs and T-shirts with phrases like “Stop domestic abuse” and the motto of One Billion Rising, “Drum! Dance! Rise!”Participants performed a short, two-minute dance tribute focusing on the empowerment of women. The dance involved a song montage, provided by Pizza X, of girl power favorites such as “Respect” by Aretha Franklin.One Billion Rising is the biggest mass-action attempt to end women’s violence on a global scale. Started on Valentine’s Day 2013, the organization allowed people across the world to come together to express their outrage, to strike, to dance and to rise in opposition of injustices women suffer in today’s age.Each year contains a different campaign focus under the realm of ending violence against women. This year the campaign is “Rising to Revolution.” The first year, the focus was to dance as a way of expression. This year, the campaign is demanding change.“This is an amazing testament to the power of dance and revolution within people,” Moss said.More than 200 countries have participated in this movement, mainly forming flash mobs in large public places to get the powerful message across. This is the second year IU has participated in the movement.“We consider ourselves dance advocates,” Alex Rhodes, president of Movement Exchange, said. “We want to use the power of dance to empower change.”Movement Exchange is also a global organization with its main mission to foster cross-cultural social change with any demographic. The IU chapter traveled to South America over winter break to teach children in impoverished towns various dances to help them express themselves in a different way.The participants ranged from Middle Way House volunteers and past victims of sexual abuse to Movement Exchange members and those who just wanted to stand with this powerful cause.“Being in a flash mob is on my bucket list and I thought this was the best way to check it off,” IU sophomore Nina Schalk said.Following the dance, participants had the opportunity to hear from Evelyn Smith, the Middle Way House representative, and learn more about local volunteer opportunities focused around the cause of women’s safety.“We don’t need heroes, we don’t need saviors, we need people that just stand up for the truth,” Smith said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The IU Student Association is tackling sexual assault.The IUSA Congress recently passed a resolution urging IU Counseling and Psychological Services to provide students who have been designated victims of sexual assault with free psychiatric visits.According to the IU Health Center website, if a patient has paid the IU Health fee, the patient’s first psychiatric visit costs $40. Subsequent visits cost $20.If a patient has not paid the IU Health fee, the patient’s first psychiatric visit costs $100. Subsequent visits ?cost $50.Though CAPS offers those who have paid an IU Health fee two free counseling sessions — distinct from psychiatric visits — per semester, IUSA representative Andrew Guenther said he believes two free counseling sessions are not sufficient in treating mental health disorders triggered by sexual assault.According to the resolution, students designated victims of sexual assault by a licensed medical caregiver or a police officer would receive free psychiatric visits until a licensed mental health care professional deems the sessions no longer necessary.“In discussions I had with students before bringing this legislation to the floor, many students were concerned as to how we’d define sexual assault, as my original draft did not include stipulations about licensed medical caregivers or police officers signing off on the cases,” said Guenther, an Indiana Daily Student ?columnist.Though Guenther said he trusts students to be truthful about whether or not they are victims of sexual assault, he felt that adding a provision stating that students would be designated victims of sexual assault by a licensed medical caregiver or a police officer increased the chances of the resolution passing.“While I would love to make it so that students do not have to pass a litmus test in order to seek out free psychiatric care, tough choices had to be made while writing this ?legislation,” he said.Though the resolution passed, several IUSA representatives still expressed ?concerns.Certain representatives were concerned that, while providing victims of sexual assault with free psychiatric visits, CAPS ought to provide victims of other traumas or patients with other concerns with free psychiatric visits.“It is a very valid point of concern and one that I hope to be able to address in the near future,” Guenther said. “However, as members of the assembly ultimately agreed with, we have data on mental healthcare relating to sexual assault and other sexual crimes. We did not have data on what I called ‘miscellaneous mental trauma and ?illness.’”However, Guenther said he would love CAPS to expand to provide free psychiatric visits to all students but start by providing free psychiatric visits to students affected by sexual assault.“By opening this door, we will have more opportunities to expand upon this policy in the future,” he said. “However, myself and other representatives feared pushing forward with too much gusto and turning CAPS off to the idea of these reforms all ?together.”Certain representatives perceive CAPS as underfunded were also concerned that such a policy isn’t feasible.“Anything that we’re going to pass about CAPS has to be very deliberate and very attainable,” IUSA representative Maggie Oates said during an IUSA Congress assembly meeting Tuesday.Though Guenther said he would love IUSA to explore CAPS funding, concerns about funding should not preclude IUSA from exploring free psychiatric visits for sexual assault victims.“If we can make strides to help our brothers and sisters who’ve experienced these traumas, we should,” he said. “And we will continue to make additional strides in the future. Striving for perfection is not an option. It is a necessary part of living in a society with flaws that can and ought to be addressed.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The year was 1938, and Dr. Alfred Kinsey engaged a packed auditorium of anxious students in conversation about a taboo ?topic: sex.Decades later, Kinsey’s devotion to studying human sexuality and shattering the silence on sexual health is illuminated in the halls of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction and continues to inspire and inform IU students, the Bloomington community and the world.The Kinsey Institute is the world’s leading sexuality and sexual health research center Jennifer Bass, Kinsey Communications ?Director, said.“As you go around the world, people might know the Kinsey Institute and might not even know Indiana University,” Bass said. “It takes time for some students to know that we’re even here.”In addition to its research and educational programs, the Institute has rotating art exhibits that change in theme each semester. The spring 2015 exhibits include “Hold that Pose,” 19th century erotic photography, and “Secret Impressions,” erotic prints and paintings. In addition to her class at Kinsey, the art is another reason for junior English and gender studies major Susannah Beckman to visit the Institute.“I love going and looking at it,” Beckman said. “I think I’m always surprised by something I see just because you see things produced more than a hundred years ago that you never thought about ?existing then.”Studying the portrayal of sexuality throughout history helps students and researchers better understand sex, Bass said.“There’s only so much you can learn from talking about sex and there’s only so much you can learn about emotions from words,” Bass said. “If you look at artwork from different times about sensitive topics, you get to a different understanding of where you are now.”Studying erotic art throughout history is helpful for society when thinking about modern pornography, Kinsey Art Curator Catherine Johnson-Roehr said.“Artists have been interested in depicting the human body and images of a sexual nature in almost forever,” Johnson-Roehr said. “The fact that they continue today is not surprising.”The current exhibit even includes a print by Rembrandt called the French Bed.“It’s very interesting to realize, ‘Wow, there was a lot going on before you were born,’” Bass said. “It helps put things in perspective about our world and as us as humans that books cannot do.”Bass said the Institute began showcasing its archived art as thematic exhibits in 1996. Beckman enjoyed seeing the fall semester’s exhibit, which displayed art that showed the relationship between sex and food.“There’s so much amazing art at the Kinsey Institute that you won’t get to see anywhere else,” Beckman said. “It’s a great opportunity to see the new shows and to see as much of it as possible.”Visitors can be assured that there will always be art for them to see when they come to Morrison Hall.“The unique thing is that our shows change,” Johnson-Roehr said. “Somebody who came here last year will see something different when they come back.”The Institute has recently shifted its research focus to studying the biology of sex and relationships, Bass said.“The focus has been on sexuality and why people make decisions on what they do with their sex lives,” Bass said. “Now, it’s getting more to the biological basis of love and nurture.”Other current research at the Institute includes studying sexual assault on campus, hormonal contraceptives in various environments and long-term relationships versus “hookups,” Bass said.“It’s a scholarship all on its own and a language all on its own,” Bass said. “It’s really profound.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Sexual assault counseling will be free beyond the first two sessions if Counseling and Psychological Services adheres to IU Student Association’s new ?resolution.The IUSA Congress passed three resolutions at an assembly meeting ?Tuesday.Representatives passed a resolution urging IU CAPS to provide students who have been designated victims of sexual assault with free individual counseling sessions until a licensed mental health care professional deems the sessions no longer necessary.Currently, individual counseling sessions cost up to $20.“Basically, this policy is seeking to right a wrong that I think is a serious wrong,” IUSA representative and Indiana Daily Student columnist Andrew Guenther said. “It’s seeking to change a policy that requires students that have been victims of sexual assault to pay a fee to receive mental health care that could have saved their life.”Though CAPS currently offers those who have paid an IU Health fee two free sessions per semester, Guenther said two free sessions is not sufficient in treating mental health disorders triggered by sexual assault.In a unanimous vote, representatives also passed a resolution urging IU-Bloomington to pursue energy efficiency, emissions reductions and renewable energy sources and ?infrastructure.The Bicentennial Strategic Plan, approved in December, calls for IU to achieve the energy efficiency and emissions reductions goals outlined in both the Campus Master Plan and the Integrated Energy Master Plan.The Campus Master Plan calls for IU-Bloomington to reduce emissions by 30 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050, while the Integrated Energy Master Plan calls for IU-Bloomington to reduce annual energy consumption costs by $3 ?million.Both plans call for accountability and transparency in regard to monitoring and reporting progress toward achieving the energy efficiency and emissions reductions goals outlined in both the Campus Master Plan and the Integrated ?Energy Master Plan.“We’re asking IU to do things it’s essentially already agreed to do,” Scott Zellner, IUSA ?representative, said.The resolution also urges IU-Bloomington to publish an annual report about progress toward achieving the energy efficiency and emissions reductions goals outlined in both the Campus Master Plan and the Integrated Energy Master Plan, as well as progress toward introducing renewable energy sources and infrastructure.The resolution further urges IU-Bloomington to invest a specified and significant level of funds toward renewable energy sources and infrastructure.In a unanimous vote, representatives also passed a resolution urging IU to specify the major on bachelor of arts degrees under the College of Arts and ?Sciences.Under current practices, bachelor of arts degrees do not specify the major, though bachelor of science degrees from the College of Arts and Sciences do, as do degrees from other IU schools.“It’s not a Big Ten thing,” Guenther said. “It’s not an IU thing. It’s just something IU has never done.”The resolution states that IUSA will work with the Office of the Recorder and with Student Central on Union to explore and implement a policy specifying the major on bachelor of arts degrees, preferably before the graduation of Spring 2015.“I think that the fact that they don’t even have their majors on there is just a slap in the face,” Joseph Zarka, IUSA representative said. “Everybody’s paying tuition, everybody’s paying the dues to get their diploma from this school and to not have their major on there just seems wrong.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Men Against Rape & Sexual Assault started in 2013 with only 50 or 60 men interested in the group. Now, MARS has about 300 members and plans to keep ?growing.Bill Phan recently became the new director of Men Against Rape & Sexual Assault. One of his first orders of business was to open membership to brothers in all ?fraternity chapters at IU.“One of my goals this semester is trying to make this a Greek community-wide group,” Phan said. “When we meet we’re going to use resources that IU provides so the men in this program will be trained to handle issues that relate to sexual assault.”MARS is designed to educate fraternity men about rape and sexual assault with the goal of preventing assaults from happening as well as knowing how to deal with them if they do.“One of the things we will definitely be doing is bystander intervention,” Phan said. “It helps guys in the program feel able to intervene if they see something that ?isn’t right.”Phan said Northwestern University has the most active MARS group in the country. He hopes to make IU’s program active, as well.“I think MARS has been dormant, not necessarily absent, from IU for a while, and I think Bill’s making a really strong effort at revitalizing the program,” said sophomore and new MARS ?member Elliot Cofer.Applications to join the group are being accepted until Feb. 20, and they can be submitted through the email each fraternity received ?from Phan.Applicants also have the opportunity to become a discussion leader, who will have more private discussion and question sessions with speakers that come to ?different MARS events.The first MARS event is planned for Feb. 28 and will feature a presentation for fraternity members titled “Blurred Lines: Lessons from the Field About Sexual ?Assault.”“We’re going to have a prosecutor going over laws and rules about what is sexual assault, what is the line,” Phan said. “It’s a very blurry line, and we want to make that a very defined line.”Defining this line for fraternity members is important so more men are able to take action if something ?goes wrong.“Each house has a risk manager, and I think this also helps to show it can’t only be the risk manager who’s dealing with all these incidents, but there can also be people who were educated through the MARS program that help the overall quality of ?fraternities,” Cofer said.MARS is also planning to have some events during the Culture of Care week in April, which is also sexual assault month.They have a tentative April 14 date for a speaker to talk about relationships.“There’s going to be advice for the Greek community, but we want to put positive light on things, such as what is a positive relationship, how to treat people and advice for the MARS members on what the expectations of a ?gentleman are,” Phan said.Along with educating fraternity members about sexual assault, MARS is also dedicated to making sure everyone is safe when they’re at the frat houses.“We want one or two guys in every frat to be a member so that every single woman can feel safe at our houses and at our parties,” Phan said. “We know it’s not just a woman’s problem — it’s a man’s problem, too.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Protective Order Assistance Partnership collaborated with a variety of student groups to hold an interactive awareness event and service project Monday afternoon.The event was a continuation of last year’s Monroe County Says “No More,” which aimed to educate students about sexual assault and domestic ?violence.For four hours, representatives from student groups hosted a variety of interactive activities in the Georgian Room at the ?Indiana Memorial Union.Activities included a donation assembly table where participants helped decorate tote bags to be filled with winter clothing and donated to the Middle Way House.They also included a station where participants could design quilt squares with personal “No More” statements.IU senior and POAP intern Stephanie Waller coordinated the event to create a greater community awareness surrounding the issue of domestic and ?sexual violence.A social work major, Waller has been involved in consent education and sexual assault prevention education with Raising Awareness of Interactions in Social Encounters for two years.“I don’t like educational events that don’t give you anywhere to go with that education, so that was the idea in bringing a student group to each table so that people can get involved in those student groups and volunteer,” Waller said.Waller said the most rewarding aspect of the experience is being able to bring their message from the county clerk’s office into the community.Waller said a crucial component of the event’s success lies in the collaborative nature of “No More.”“It seems like this year there’s definitely a push for us all to come together,” Waller said. “We’re a lot stronger when we can all put our message out ?together.”Mai Ngo, a member of the IU Hapkido Club and Self Defense Club, said sexual assault and domestic violence are issues that do not receive adequate ?attention.“Not a lot of people hear about it and not a lot of people think about it, when in fact many people are victims,” Ngo said. “I wish that we didn’t have to feel the need to be prepared, but it’s a reality, so it’s nice to know how to protect yourself.”Other groups present included the Feminist Student Association, RAISE, Culture of Care , OASIS and GLBT Support Services.Waller said the best way for students to get involved is to contact any of these organizations or visit them on campus.People can also like the Facebook page “Monroe County Says ‘No More’” to access details concerning future events.“It is a hard subject to talk about because there is usually a stigma around sexual assault, and there is usually a stigma around domestic violence,” Waller said.She contends, however, that this is not a sufficient excuse for not talking about important issues like domestic and sexual violence and bringing them to the forefront of conversation.“There are people in your life who are experiencing these things, and they need to be talked about and they need to be advocated against,” Waller said.“I’d rather be uncomfortable and talk about it than have one more person go through it,” she said. “It’s time. How many more years is this going to go on? It’s time for us to say no more.”',\n",

BPD received a call from someone at Advanced Auto Parts on 302 S. Cory Lane after a male subject reportedly entered the store and indicated he had been shooting heroin.The man reportedly appeared to be under the influence when officers arrived at the store and interacted with him.He told officers a second male subject had forced him to take heroin and an unknown pill and that he “felt like he was going to die,” Capt. Qualters said. The man told officers he had woken up with a syringe in his left arm that had an unknown substance in it and that his pants were at his ankles. He reportedly told officers he felt he had been sexually assaulted. Capt. Qualters said the incident likely took place at an apartment on the west side of Bloomington near Advanced Auto Parts.The man was transported to IU Health Bloomington Hospital and had several verbal and emotional outbursts while being transported, Capt. Qualters said. The man became uncooperative at the hospital and refused to have a sexual assault kit completed. He indicated he would speak with an officer at another date.Officers discovered the man had an outstanding warrant from Owen County, and he was transported to the Monroe County Jail.Andy Wittry',\n",

       "  'body': 'Around 33 percent of survivors of sexual assault have suicidal thoughts, while about 13 percent of sexual assault survivors will attempt suicide.Additionally, nearly one-third of all rape victims develop post-traumatic stress disorder, the mental illness caused by extremely scarring events.Rape victims develop PTSD at a rate almost 6.2 times that of the general population. Victims of rape and sexual assault are also three times more likely than non-victims to have a major ?depressive episode.They contemplate suicide more than four times as often than non-victims and 13 times as likely to attempt ?suicide.Survivors of sexual assault and rape are also 13.4 times more likely to have two or more major alcohol problems and are 26 times more likely to have two or more serious drug abuse problems.These statistics are not fun or enjoyable to read. They may have made you cringe or feel uncomfortable.Good.We live in a world today that is far too blasé about mental illness and substance abuse in regards to victims of sexual assault or rape. Any time I can make people feel uncomfortable or uneasy, I know that they’re realizing we have a major problem.Here at IU, Sexual Assault Crisis Services, a subsection of Counseling and Psychological Services, services about 30 to 35 victims of sexual ?assault weekly.Whether or not these are returning students or first-time visitors is unavailable for public viewing due to ?confidentiality laws.SACS is staffed by a grand total of two people who assist visitors with both in-person and over-the-phone ?counseling.Beyond that, there is not a licensed psychiatrist on staff, which means that SACS has to send its patients who desire or need psychiatric care or ?medication to CAPS.These students get two free sessions, which are mainly used as intake and background information gathering, for CAPS, the same free sessions given to all IU students. Afterwards, students have to pay $20 or more for CAPS sessions with a doctor who can ?prescribe medication.It could take several sessions per week for several months for victims of sexual assault or rape to make headway on a mental illness that might have resulted from the horrific experience you’ve had.For low-income students, those without adequate healthcare or who simply don’t want their parents to know they are seeking mental healthcare for a sexual assault-related illness, a $20 ?session adds up rather ?quickly.For a University that claims to stand at the forefront of supporting victims of sexual assault and rape, it certainly seems as though we are focusing exclusively on sexual assault prevention.While it’s fantastic that we want to prevent sexual assault, we need comprehensive policies and actions to deal with the aftermath in the terrible situation that those preventative ?policies do fail.Whether it’s providing more funding for CAPS and SACS or subsidizing the cost of CAPS sessions for those with mental illnesses caused by sexual assault, IU needs to stand with its brothers and sisters who have experienced the tragedy that befalls far too many ?students.ajguenth@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'It’s on us.This was the overarching message from Friday’s meeting on the new Sexual Misconduct Policy, Title IX compliance and Student Welfare Initiative.In addition to an hourlong presentation on the new policies, Chief Student Welfare and Title IX Officer Emily Springston and Chief Policy Officer Jenny Kincaid answered questions from the audience, which was comprised primarily of IU staff and faculty.Springston’s presentation described the line of defense against sexual misconduct on campus: It’s on the Title IX Coordinator and deputies to oversee sexual misconduct reports, it’s on the faculty to report and encourage students to report sexual misconduct and it’s on the students to continually shape the campus ?culture.“I would argue that some of the most effective things we can do right now are get the message out there that this is not tolerated,” Springston said. “The more people who speak up and the more we have campaigns like ‘It’s On Us,’ with people just vocalizing, you make the norm that this is not tolerated behavior. We will start to shun and make the people who may engage in this behavior feel less and less comfortable in that action.”The new policies and initiatives are in response to the compliance review of the University’s handlings of sexual harassment and sexual violence complaints under Title IX.The Department of Education informed IU President Michael McRobbie on March 12, 2014 that IU would be under review and requested 33 different counts of information, including documentation of all sexual harassment complaints and their hearings from the 2011-2012 school year, according to documents obtained by the Indiana Daily ?Student.“This community has, for a long time, done a lot of work, as has the campus,” Associate Dean of Students Carol McCord said. “This is a new initiative and push — that’s good, absolutely great. In fact, I think if we didn’t have this national attention to it we probably wouldn’t have pushed it this much and I think it’s good that we’re getting that.”The conclusive results of the Title IX investigation have not yet been released.On Friday, many audience members asked specific questions about sexual misconduct statistics that could not be answered because the annual report is still being processed.Audience members continued to ask about the lack of comprehensible and accessible data.Springston explained that statistics are affected by factors such as sexual assault and sexual harassment being handled separately and complainants who request not to move forward with their report.McCord also noted that many who are involved in a sexual misconduct incident often do not report it.“I want to caution about not getting too caught up about what those numbers are,” McCord said. “In the end, we’re still going to use them, and we need to get them out there. It helps us get a more accurate picture, more complete picture, but that’s not the complete story.”The annual report will include statistics on sexual misconduct complaints, hearings and outcomes. The report will be released this spring or summer, Springston said.“Clearly the need for you all to see that is loud and clear, we hear that,” Springston said. “We want to get that to you.”The Community Attitudes and Experiences with Sexual Assault Survey, which was administered to students in November, is also currently under review, McCord said.The survey measured campus climate and was taken voluntarily by 23 percent of the student body, Springston said.Some basic conclusions from the survey will be shared with student groups March 8 followed by feedback from students on the results and on what they want to know more about, McCord said.Faculty members will learn about the results of the survey and the student focus groups in May. Then, all of this information will be used for programming for the fall semester, McCord said.Staff members also asked for a further explanation of the obligations set for “responsible employees” and “confidential employees” in the new policy.The policy defines responsible employees as “University employees who have the authority to redress sexual misconduct, who have the duty to report incidents of sexual misconduct or who a student could reasonably believe has this authority or duty.”This essentially means all faculty members who engage with students are legally bound to reporting sexual misconduct under the Office of Civil Rights. This includes, but is not limited to, all professors, advisers, coaches and administrators.In some cases this also applies to students who are employed by the University such as associate instructors, teaching assistants and resident hall staff members.Responsible employees are obligated to report any information they have about a sexual misconduct incident including names, dates and locations.In the past, some faculty members have been uncomfortable with this responsibility and were fearful of losing the trust of their students, Springston said.To remedy this, responsible employees who are uncomfortable with reporting are trained to redirect students to confidential employees before the student shares details of sexual misconduct.Confidential employees are mental health counselors and health care professionals at on-campus health centers who are not legally bound to reporting sexual misconduct.“At the heart of it is the notion that if a student is sharing information and they’re reaching out and seeking help, we need to make sure we get the attention of the people who are in places to respond,” Springston said.Assistant Dean of Students of Women’s and Gender Affairs Leslie Fasone also addressed the role of students during these policy changes. Fasone mentioned IU’s adoption of the White House campaign “It’s On Us.”Students can enter a public service announcement competition by sending in a 30 to 60 second video on sexual assault awareness and prevention. The competition closes Wednesday, Feb. 18.“We’re really trying to have the students share this message to help them change their norms and us provide support,” Fasone said. “We’re trying to get students out there to educate one another. It’s really about all of us coming together and enhancing what we’re currently doing and then identify where are our gaps and what else can we be doing to meet those gaps with prevention.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'As junior A.J. Brettell walked by the Theatre Building on his way to class last week, the banner for “Good Kids” abruptly stopped him.“As soon as I saw that, it immediately hit me because I experienced it all firsthand,” Brettell said. “I definitely wanted to dive deeper and see what it was all about.”Brettell lived in Steubenville, Ohio, during the summer of 2012, when a high school girl was sexually assaulted by a few of her football player peers at a party. This case became widespread once the football players tweeted, posted pictures and published videos of the assault on social media. Once the posts reached students and parents in the town, national news recognized not only the issue of sexual assault but social media’s status as a main method of ?communication.Based loosely on that event, “Good Kids” opened Friday at the Wells-Metz Theatre. Its goal was to explain the true definition of consent and the power social media holds in society today.Prior to the show, a panel of individuals from the sexual assault violence support networks located on campus and in the Bloomington area gathered in the Theatre Building to discuss the issue of sexual assault.After each of the panelists introduced themselves, Jonathan ?Michaelsen, director and IU Theatre department chair, asked participants if they felt sexual assault is an issue that has gotten better or worse over the years.“I’ve worked here since 1990, and I personally feel that I am far busier now than I have ever been in terms of clients,” said Debbie Melloan, a counselor for Sexual Assault Crisis Services. “I want to believe it’s that more people feel comfortable coming for help, and I think we as a university and the culture at large know there’s a lot more openness talking about ?sexual assault and coming forward and seeking services.”Carol McCord, associate dean of students at IU, said she doesn’t think the number of assaults has increased but that it’s been a tradition in our culture to not talk about it.“Even with the best possible numbers collected, we’re only getting a sense of the people who have come forward to somebody,” ?McCord said.As the panel concluded, people started making their way into the theater. Pop songs like “All About That Bass” and “#SELFIE” played in the background and high school football posters filled the walls.“We went into it talking about the physical environment and starting with this idea of this football culture,” Michaelsen said. “We’ve created a world that I think is simple but provocative.”After Brettell saw the play, he said he told the cast and crew how impressed he was with how accurate the play matched the real events.“The first thing I said to everyone involved in the play was that it was like me sitting at home just with a huge screen in front of my face with the event on replay,” Brettell said. “The same feelings, the same eeriness and questions I had at that time. Even though I knew what the end result was, I was still thinking what was going to happen.”Brettell said he agreed with one of the lines in the play that said there’s nothing to do in the town, and when kids get bored, they get in trouble.“It’s the honest truth,” Brettell said. “There’s nothing to do in that city. If you’re a high school kid, there’s nothing to do. So you throw parties, and when you’re underage drinking, bad things happen.”Brettell said a lot of messages can be learned from the play by audience members, whether students or adults.“If you’re an adult, it can shine light to wonder if this is happening in your town’s high school,” Brettell said. “If you’re a kid, you might look at it as saying no matter how invincible I think I am, you can still get caught when you do wrong. If you just watch it with an open mind and heart, you can really get a idea of what some people go through.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"It’s 9 p.m. on a Saturday night.The anxious giggles of sorority girls bounce off the bathroom walls.Queen B is playing on the speakers in the background, and there is a fight for wall plugs because they’re full of ?straighteners and curling irons. Once everyone is primped and prepped, you head off into a sober ride to the mystical world that is the ?fraternity house.Booze is being poured from strange containers, and mixed drinks are being stirred for a little too long. There’s smoke coming from a room upstairs, and around midnight, everyone’s eyes start to become hazy.Things become blurred, and four shots turn into 12. The dance floor empties out, and upstairs the rooms are abuzz with activities too indecent to write out. You can picture how the night will end. But what if the night didn't have to end in some random bedroom with a stranger?Recently, the New York Times ?published an article that spoke of plans for sororities to start drinking on their own turf.Maybe in a world full of rainbows and butterflies this would be a perfect plan. But at the Editorial Board, we realize we live in a world full of foul smelling bus exhaust and squirrels too friendly for their own good. There are a few major complications with sororities throwing weekly bangers to avoid drug and rape ?problems.The first women’s sorority was established in 1851. The mid-19th century wasn’t too big on binge drinking, therefore the policies that surround sororities don’t even address drinking, drugs or rape.Nowadays, every sorority has a similar code of standards and ethics regarding not drinking in the house, “man hours,” drugs and misconduct. These modern-day rules strictly apply to each organization’s founding ideals.By allowing fraternity men to come into a sorority house for a party, it would create an entire shift that would digress from the old-age principles that sorority rules were built off of. If this were to be put in front of a national chapter, there would be ?resistance because partying isn’t what any organization wants to stand for, ?nonetheless host.IU would probably be more ?accepting of new proposals, but the fact of the matter is these changes would require a tremendous amount of time, effort and money.Beside the historic complications, there are the commonplace concerns that arise from the construction of a sorority house itself. The bottom line is they are not built with basement party rooms or elevated surfaces.If the money was invested and nationals somehow came to an agreement and all of these things were to change, the sorority house would ?essentially become a frat.Drinking would consume social lives, illegal substances would be found in almost everyone’s rooms and the vibrations coming from the ?speakers would be never-ending.Strictly addressing IU, there are three sober monitors from each organization that should be present at all drinking events.These monitors look to stop reckless behavior and encourage safety for all members. So it’s hard to tell how much change would occur if the partying were to happen at a sorority instead of a ?fraternity. Maybe there would be less rape, maybe not. There’s no way to tell.But rapes don’t occur because of the environment — they occur because of who is in the situation. This proposal addresses the ?symptom of partying, not the true ?problem: sexual assault.If there’s going to be any changes made to “prevent” assault, it will have to be made by the people responsible for these rapes.Otherwise, you’re just swapping Greek houses.\",\n",

The play follows the interaction of high school students after a sexual assault takes place at a party one night. The play is inspired by true events in the small town of Steubenville, Ohio.In addition to the students talking about the situation throughout the show, Director and IU Theatre Department Chair Jonathan Michaelsen said the play covers many other teen-related topics as well.“The sense of what sexual assault is and means and what consent means I think is an important issue as well,” Michaelsen said. “Following on the pattern after the case is the sense of social media and how quickly an event can be judged by millions of people not in a court of law but in the blogosphere, or cyberspace.”Before the show and following the other performances, IU Theatre will present a panel of professionals to talk about different topics concerning sexual assault. Sarah Campbell, a graduate student working with the IU Theatre, helped to set up the different panels.“We saw the need for something because the show deals with really heavy things, and we didn’t just want the audience to go out in the streets after the show with no way to talk about what they had just seen,” Campbell said. “We thought it would be great to have experts come in and talk with the audience members in hope that they would be able to ask questions and the experts would be able to give good information about resources available on campus.”As a graduate student, Campbell said it was hard for her to get information about sexual assault prevention when she came to IU because she did not receive the guidance that freshmen are given during orientation.“If the University does talk about resources, it’s more geared towards how to help your undergraduates, which is great, but there are definitely audiences at the University that aren’t receiving the information either because they don’t know where to find it or they’re just not paying attention,” Campbell said. “So I think it’s important to have that information out there.”Michaelsen said the panels are a huge element of the message the show is trying to make in spreading awareness of the issue and how to deal with it on a college campus.“It’s difficult I think for a university because we aren’t a court and yet we try and regulate these things and have hearing and take it seriously,” Michaelsen said. “I think we’re in the process of figuring that out, respecting the victim and if you should report this to law enforcement.”Campbell said the individuals speaking on the panels were all very enthusiastic to participate in the collaborating with IU Theatre.“I think they’re all great advocates, and they’re really excited to share what they do and just spread the word about either the problems with sexual violence that we have on campus but also how they can help through their offices,” Campbell said. “They’re really here to help, and any opportunity they get to do that, they’re obviously really excited.”Although the topic of sexual ?assault is very serious, Wenz said she encourages people to come to the show because the premise is more uplifting than people might think.“I think that’s the danger with this is if people hear about what this play is based on and the theme of the play, they’re not going to want to come to it because it is a heavy subject matter and because they feel like they’re going to get a talking to basically,” Wenz said. “It’s more experiencing this rape situation that happened in Steubenville alongside the community.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The idea of virginity is one that is heavily loaded and ever-so tricky to define. One cannot discuss virginity — as a status, as a concept, or even as a word — without rendering the conversation specifically to women, and is therefore problematic.While men can obviously be described as “virgins” or “virginal,” the phenomenon of virginity was first oriented around women and their ?“virtue” — or lack thereof.According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Catholic Church first described a virgin as “an unmarried or chaste maiden or woman” around 1200.Ever since its establishment, society has obsessed over the idea of a woman’s status as a sexual being by using this word as a noun, an identity.“I’m a virgin” was a phrase that seemed ever-present in high school, framed either as a proud declaration or sheepish admission. We grow up understanding virginity as a status: you either are one, or you aren’t.Until, that is, the conversation becomes about a woman who does have a sex life, at which point the rhetoric of identity makes a drastic shift to the rhetoric of materialism. Suddenly, virginity is a commodity to be “lost.” A virgin is someone to be “ruined” and rebranded as a “fallen woman.”Let it be said that virginity is not a one-sided concept. It involves both men and women, and what it means to them as individual beings. There should be no universal definition of what it means to be a virgin.The Editorial Board believes that how we define virginity is our own individual and personal choice. It is not for society to decide what it means to be a virgin or what it means to lose one’s virginity.Kinsey Confidential is an online resource provided by the Kinsey Institute to provide accurate, research-based information on sexual health. According to its mission statement, it provides “accessible, topical information based on current scientific knowledge, and it shares news and trends related to sex, gender and sexual health.”Kinsey Confidential provides resources for questions concerning sexual health and wellness education, counseling, contraception and pregnancy, LGBT, sexual assault crisis ?services and STI/HIV information. Sexuality education programs and classes are available on its website, as well as a sex Q&A column.The resources are available and they are closer to us than we think. The stigmas attached to sexual health can often deter young people from reaching out for help or even talking about it in the first place.Starting the conversation is the first step. Somehow, we’ve forgotten that virgins and non-virgins are people with immense inherent value regardless of the socially-constructed, purely fictional “status” that is virginity. Attaching someone’s human worth to sexual activity is blatantly ?discriminatory and subtly violent.Sex is, of course, a hugely general term that acts more as an umbrella under which scores of activities fall rather than a specific, singular experience.In 2015, sex is in the eye of the beholder. Therefore virginity, if the idea insists on surviving, should be too.The concepts of sex and virginity exist on a sort of gradient scale that is defined entirely on an individual basis using utterly subjective terms. It is a choice.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Students listen when other students talk about preventing sexual violence.That’s the idea behind IU’s decision to promote the message of “It’s On Us” through a public service announcement video contest. “It’s On Us” is a national awareness campaign created by the White House in 2014 that aims to address the issue of sexual violence on college campuses.The video contest is open to any IU student, group, organization or department. The winning 30 to 60-second PSA will capture the message of the “It’s On Us” campaign and how IU students can step up to ?prevent sexual assault.“We found that one of the best ways students receive messages is when those messages are from one another,” Leslie Fasone, assistant dean of women’s and gender affairs, said. “The idea was how can we adopt this national campaign promoted by the White House and how can we engage students in sharing these messages.”The “It’s On Us” campaign is being promoted across all IU campuses, Fasone said, though the PSA competition is unique to Bloomington.“I think that something that is really powerful is that we’re sharing the message about student welfare across all eight campuses,” Fasone said. “It’s showing we are one. There is a great deal of administrative ?support for these initiatives.”The winning video will portray a message consistent with the “It’s On Us” campaign while adapting the content to IU, Fasone said. Examples include demonstrating bystander intervention, discussing what it means to get consent before sex and highlighting campus resources.Interested parties should send an email expressing their intent to submit to ?care@indiana.edu by midnight Feb. 18. Videos must be uploaded to YouTube and the link emailed via a form on the dean of students’ website by midnight Feb. 22.The winner will be announced March 2 and the video will be shown during halftime of the last home men’s basketball game against Michigan State on March 7. IU Communications will also promote the video.Fasone said six groups have already expressed an intent to submit and she is ?excited to see the final results.“We wanted to be creative and to encourage people who might not normally be involved with sexual assault prevention to become involved,” she said. “I’m really anxious to see what they come up with and how that will motivate people to step up, to intervene and to ask for consent.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'In an average classroom of 100 students, 18 students will have been diagnosed with depression, seven will have seriously considered suicide and 1.5 will have attempted suicide during the past 12 months, according to IU’s Counseling and Psychological Services.Crimson CORPS is looking for a group of undergraduate students interested in tackling these mental health issues.Applications for next ?academic year are due Feb. 6.Crimson CORPS, short for Caring, Open-Minded, Respectful Peer Support, is a group of undergraduate students trained and supervised by the staff at CAPS, according to the Crimson CORPS ?website.Through peer-to-peer support, advocacy and outreach, the group of students work to bring awareness to mental health issues, reduce the stigma surrounding them and support peers struggling with these problems.“I have had an extremely valuable experience in Crimson CORPS,” said junior and Crimson CORPS member Taylor Claxton. “I have learned so much about mental health, and I’ve learned the helping skills that I need to be able to make a difference.”Undergraduate students who join Crimson CORPS are expected to volunteer for at least three semesters, ?including one semester of orientation and two semesters of practice, attend biweekly meetings, attend one six-hour training session per semester and one 90-minute training session per month and participate in at least two outreach programs per semester.At the six-hour training sessions, members focus on general skills, such as how to listen, how to ask questions and when to ask the right questions, said junior and member of Crimson CORPS Leah Edge.At the 90-minute training sessions, members focus on a particular mental health issue, such as depression, anxiety, suicide, eating disorder, sexual assault and problem-drinking and drug use, Edge said. Members then learn how to recognize particular mental health issue as well as appropriate intervention and referral techniques.“We do a lot of role playing and practicing of the skills that we talk about because that’s the best way to get comfortable with using the skills that we talk about,” Edge said.Claxton said members split into groups of six to eight people. One pair role plays and practices the skill they learned as the rest of the group and a staff member from CAPS watches, providing feedback on what the pair did well and what the pair could have done differently.Members then apply the skills acquired in training to peer-to-peer mentoring.“Others should know that as Crimson CORPS members, we are not licensed therapists or psychologists and we cannot counsel students like the CAPS staff can,” Claxton said. “However, we are trained on sensitive topics that make it easier for us to talk with students that are struggling and guide them to getting professional help if they want it.”Members also apply the skills acquired in training ?sessions to outreach events.Claxton said members are divided into teams and each team coordinates an outreach event, such as Celebrate EveryBody Week, Culture of Care Week, depression screenings, DeStress Fest, Mental Health Awareness Day and Sex, Drugs, and ?Rock and Roll.Edge said she finds such outreach events the most rewarding, as they are where she sees the biggest impact.“As a social work major, the things that I learn in Crimson CORPS and in my classes tend to overlap, but the outreach is something that is unique to Crimson CORPS,” she said. “I just don’t get to do that very in-depth, face-to-face outreach in anything else ?that I do.”Claxton, however, said she finds peer-to-peer mentoring the most rewarding.“We can’t help everyone because not everyone wants to be helped,” she said. “But we can show that we care and sometimes that’s all someone needs.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Vanderbilt University rape trial has recently roused a great deal of attention.The trial involved two ?former football players, ?Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey, who raped an unconscious girl in a dorm ?June 23, 2013.It happened in the span of 30 minutes but changed ?someone’s life forever.After 19 long months, the trial finally took place.A three-hour deliberation was all it took for the jury to find both defendants guilty of sexual assault.Although I am grateful for the justice the verdict will bring, what shocked me the most about this case was the defense argument that Vanderbilt culture ?influenced Batey and ?ultimately led to the assault.I guess that could be ?considered marginally ?convincing.After all, there was ?alcohol involved — something that is not uncommon on college ?campuses.Batey had been in trouble twice with ethics at the school before the assault and was sactioned for smoking ?marijuana.Furthermore, there is a stigma about college culture stronger than any stench of booze, drugs and dope.The substance abuse and the sexual promiscuity on college campuses influence people to act in ways they ?otherwise would not.Yet, I think this cultural ?argument is problematic.Supposing we buy this defense argument, we would be making any individual’s actions and wrongdoings ?excusable due to the ?influence of an entire ?society.It would express the ?notion that people who rape are not really responsible for it, but victims themselves in the turmoil of rape culture.It’s the culture that is to blame.Sure, on an abstract level, this could be the case.However, it makes little sense when we put ourselves in the shoes of the victim.The girl had obviously been subject to non-consensual physical penetration.Such a thing could not have been achieved without the help of a person.And yet, if we were to say the person who committed the act was not wholly ?responsible, then it would make little sense.The problem here is ?evident: culture does not rape people.People rape people.We cannot blame culture for the misconduct of an ?individual.Thus, I think when talking about sexual abuse on college campuses, it is wrong to ?accredit certain actions to some kind of campus culture.For one, it gives off the wrong idea about college life in general and facilitates a negative social stigma.College is a time of ?intellectual engagement and personal growth.Yet, the negative ?connotations given to the phrases “campus culture” and “college life” give off the idea that everyone just wants to get drunk, get high and have sex.Not only is this degrading to us as college students, but it also becomes an excuse for misconduct.And while the former problem might be somehow dismissed, the Vanderbilt rape case has shown the latter is definitely not.nywu@indiana.edu',\n",

Leggings are ?comfortable and functional.I choose to wear them with longer shirts and ?sweaters because they keep my legs warm.I put them on knowing as I run around campus I won’t have to continuously pull at them to keep them up like I would with jeans.I have never put on a pair of leggings and thought, “Now these will make guys want to have sex with me.”Partridge is correct when saying yoga pants are thin and form-fitting.However, that is exactly what makes them ?functional.When working out, yoga pants keep my lower body cool and free to move easily.If I were to wear thick sweatpants, they would ?restrict my body movements, decreasing the ?quality of my workout.Partridge’s issue with this clothing is that it fit women’s figures so well.It is true leggings and yoga pants do flatter women’s ?bodies in a way that is ?attractive.There is no good reason to tell women wearing ?clothing that is flattering is wrong.In fact, it is Partridge’s reason for avoiding wearing these pieces in public that is wrong.She is basically ?sending the message that ?women who are sexually ?assaulted — or worse — are ?responsible for the assault.Partridge decided not to wear leggings or yoga pants because her husband told her it was difficult to not look at other women who were wearing them.Partridge avoids holding her husband accountable for his own lustful thoughts and places the blame on women.This is a wrong and ?outdated way to handle this situation.We need to make men responsible for their own thoughts and actions.If a woman’s clothing makes a man want to have sex with her, then that’s the man’s responsibility.We cannot continue to tell women they need to ?constantly adjust their ?movements, words, actions and clothing in order to ?divert the male gaze.If leggings are not sexually attracting a man, then something else would.It is a man’s responsibility to rightfully handle his sexual thoughts and actions.A woman’s clothing should not be responsible.eshrack@indiana.edu',\n",

These tips focused on multiple ways that I can “protect” myself from rape, such as running and screaming for ?protection or keeping an eye on my drink.Nowhere did this alert mention that one should ask for consent before engaging in sexual activities or, you know, not rape someone.The problem with this type of education is that it places the weight of the problem on the victims.It perpetuates the idea I won’t be raped as long as I follow these tips, and if I am raped, it’s because I didn’t do enough to prevent or stop it.This is dangerous. It redirects the responsibility away from the individual who commits the crime.With this email coming from the police, isn’t the point to focus on the crime?That’s what was said by the official IU Bloomington Twitter (@IUBloomington) in response to individuals who brought up similar questions.@IUBloomington stated the focus is on responding to the crime, but let’s remember the crime wasn’t that someone was raped.It was that someone raped another person.So, why not focus on those actions?The alert included in the email (http://stopsexualviolence.iu.edu) leads you to the website by the Student Welfare Initiative.This initiative is an attempt to have a coordinated response to the issue of sexual assault across the entire IU ?system.The issue is that this website provides the same “safety tips” included in the crime alert.There is some information about consent, but it is in an area separate from the “safety tips.”While I admire what IU is doing to attempt to end this issue on campus, it is clear that there is more work to be done in how we educate students on these ?issues.Sarah Fernandezssfernan@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'It’s a sad day in America when the comedic father of the century makes jokes about his own rape allegations at a comedy show.On Jan. 9, Bill Cosby made a quick joke about the rape accusations during a stand-up performance at the Budweiser Gardens in London, Canada. A woman rose from her seat to fetch a drink, only to be asked by Cosby about where she was going. According to National Post reporter Richard Warnica, the woman in the audience told Cosby she was getting a drink and asked if he wanted one. Cosby said he had a bottle of water onstage and then said, ”You have to be careful about drinking around me.”Anyone following the recent coverage of Cosby knows he’s referring to the method of rape he has been accused of: drugging women’s beverages and preying on them.Sunday night during the 72nd Annual Golden Globes, comedian hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler made some quip remarks about the allegations against Cosby. During a description of “Into the Woods,” Poehler went on to tie Cosby into the ramble of jokes and said, “Sleeping Beauty just thought she was getting coffee with Bill Cosby.”The two Hollywood besties then went on to do impersonations of “The Cosby Show” creator with lines like “I put the pills in the people,” and “I got the pills in the bathrobe and I put ‘em in the people.” The reaction from the crowd was mixed — some less than pleased, others humored. Most were simply shocked.The difference between jokes shared by Fey and Poehler and those by the comedian in question are the motives behind them and the message it sends. People continuously shout that rape jokes aren’t funny, and that hasn’t changed.But Fey and Poehler called out America’s Dad on national television, and they did so in their own way. Both actresses have been rather outspoken about women’s rights during their careers and the undertone of their witty remarks were clear: we stand against what you’ve done, and we believe these women.It appears that Cosby has yet to take this issue seriously.The Editorial Board believes that more than a dozen women with stories of sexual assault cannot be swept under the rug.Though representatives of Cosby have denied the allegations and pointed out that most are decades old, the only direct answer the public has received from Cosby is this joke in ?London, Canada.The comedian has refused to answer any questions from reporters about the allegations and was discovered trying to bully an Associated Press reporter from airing questions asked about the ?accusations.It appears the reason most people have difficulty swallowing the Cosby allegations is because they cannot accept that a beloved man who’s warmed our hearts for years could do something so heinous. It’s up to the public to realize that most rapists aren’t lurking from bushes in the dark. They are friends, family, people you know and people you watch on television.The Editorial Board has decided that it’s time to say “Goodbye, friend” and demand answers from Cosby. More than a dozen accounts from women shouldn’t be outweighed by one man because he made us chuckle.As Fey and Poehler said about their own Cosby jokes: “That seems fair.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'A former IUPD cadet and IU student, expelled for violating the University’s consent policy, is suing IU for gender discrimination.Aaron Farrer, 21, alleges that the University’s policies for sexual assault investigations unfairly favor women and fail to protect the accused, according to court documents.“IU violated Title IX by creating a gender biased, hostile environment against males, like Farrer, based in part on IU’s pattern and practice of disciplining male students who accept physical contact initiated by female students, but failing to discipline female students who engage in the same conduct,” Farrer’s attorneys wrote in the complaint.Farrer was accused of sexual assault in October 2015 by Marion Zerfoss, 21, a fellow student and neighbor. He was left to take care of Zerfoss after she was drinking at a party in her home, and the two had sex while he was looking after her.While Farrer argued Zerfoss initiated the sex, Zerfoss has said she was blacked out and had not wanted to have sex. She filed a complaint with IU and the Bloomington Police Department. Farrer was arrested and charged with rape.After a University investigation, Farrer was expelled in November 2015, on the basis that he had violated the University consent policy, which says consent cannot be given by someone who is extremely intoxicated.Farrer and Zerfoss could not be reached for comment.The criminal case against Farrer in Monroe Superior Court, however, was dismissed in September 2016 due to insufficient evidence.Farrer’s federal lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.It lists Zerfoss and IU as defendants, as well as a slew of University officials: Jason Casares, former deputy Title IX director, Vivian Hernandez, assistant director of IU’s Office of Student Ethics, Harold “Pete” Goldsmith, dean of students, Amber Monroe, IU’s associate director and Title IX deputy investigator and members of the disciplinary panel that expelled Farrer.According to court documents, Farrer is suing for “defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violations of Title IX” and violation of due process. He alleges that “IU engaged in a gender-biased investigation of Farrer, which culminated in Farrer’s unlawful expulsion from IU.”Margie Smith-Simmons, IU spokeswoman, said the University cannot comment on the lawsuit or Farrer’s case due to privacy laws.“The University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy provides for a fair, impartial and robust investigation and adjudication process when responding to reports of alleged sexual assault,” Smith-Simmons said. “Indiana University is strongly committed to providing a safe and secure environment for all members of its community, and assuring that its processes are fair and afford due process protections.”Farrer is seeking $75,000, demanding a jury trial and is asking to be reinstated as a student at IU, according to court documents.An earlier version cited a contradicting court document that listed Farrer as seeking damages in the excess of $75,000. The IDS regrets this error.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Two people began wrapping one another in paper towels, transforming into what Skye Kantola referred to as a powerful image of the dichotomy between survivor and perpetrator.The scene was a part of an allegorical skit — an exercise Kantola, program coordinator of Multicultural Efforts to End Sexual Assault, used to represent the facets of sexual assault and its relationship to underserved communities, especially the LGBTQ community.The exercise comprised the final portion of the Sexual Violence Prevention Across Gender and Sexuality Workshop. This portion was organized by MESA and the Middle Way House on Wednesday.The event focused on teaching sexual violence prevention in a more engaging and collaborative way.“Unfortunately, education often happens in a way that the educator brings the knowledge and the students receives it,” Kantola said. “Education needs to be free of oppression in order to combat oppression. In order to do this, we need to have interaction rather than passively receiving information.”Kantola said this collaborative process is representative of her strategy in educating counselors, social workers, social service and medical professionals and advocates about the experiences of members of the LGBTQ community, especially those who are survivors of sexual assault.The six-hour workshop included other interactive elements, including monologues, dialogues and discussions about heteronormative systems that may make it more difficult for the queer community to receive the help they need both in everyday life and in dealing with sexual assault.“No individual created this system, but we all exist in it,” Kantola said. “We need to be aware of the effect of this system and work to overcome it.”Myke Luurtsema, prevention educator at the Middle Way House, said it is the responsibility of every individual to contribute toward overcoming this system.Awareness of whether our language reinforces gender and sexuality norms is vital to overcoming them, Luurtsema said.Kantola said she hopes the collaborative aspect of the workshop would benefit attendees in a unique way.“I hope that they learned things from the content of the discussion and collaboration because then you get the ability to learn from so many people and sources at once,” Kantola said. “I also hope that they met people that can help them in any capacity in their own work.”Sam Harrell, county services specialist from the Middle Way House, said the learning format helps form new understanding by presenting individual experiences.“I think events like this can really help social workers and other professionals to really understand the struggles the queer community may face, especially when looking for sexual assault prevention and support programs,” Harrell said.Harrell said they felt reliance on emotional and cultural stories made the event a more engaging experience.Kantola said she agrees these individualized experiences have a greater impact than the more common lecture techniques often used in sexual assault prevention workshops.“I’m always amazed at how much I learn from the participants as well, because the participants are so different in their identities and their experiences, so they all bring something different to the table,” Kantola said. “These different experiences make the workshop more impactful and engaging and more capable of creating change.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'It’s December, and awards season is finally and fully upon us.In the last few weeks, critics associations have begun to recognize the best performances and films of the year with a flurry of awards, fueling preliminary Oscar buzz and beginning endless speculations that will lead up to the day of the show.While results have varied, one name in particular has garnered strong frontrunner status in the Best Actor race. Casey Affleck secured awards for “Manchester by the Sea” from multiple critics’ groups and has been the subject of various magazine profiles and rave reviews. At this point, he’s Hollywood’s golden boy, and it’s his race to lose.Let’s rewind for a moment to another Hollywood golden boy, who began the year with similar coverage thanks to the debut of his film “The Birth of a Nation” at 2016’s Sundance Film Festival. Back then, actor/director Nate Parker seemed poised for Oscar gold as well, until his history of alleged sexual assault came to light.When the news broke of Parker’s alleged rape of a female college student - and the student’s eventual suicide - he was booted from the frontrunner pedestal with astonishing speed.Critics, audiences and Hollywood bigwigs boycotted the film and spoke out against him in droves. It seemed like a long-overdue reaction to the kind of person whose sins the entertainment industry tends to forgive and forget.It seemed clear, thanks to Parker’s case, that the industry refused to separate the art from the artist any longer. They would no longer overlook similar crimes and mistreatment of women in favor of rewarding a talented male actor or director. Finally, it appeared, a precedent had been set.Then, this fall, rumors began to spread about Casey Affleck’s past conduct with women. A cover story about the actor in Variety magazine mentioned briefly that he had a history of alleged sexual harassment. Other sites, like the Daily Beast, did extensive research into the claims and discovered that Affleck had been accused of sexual harassment against coworkers while on the set of his film “I’m Still Here.”Complaints ranged from physical intimidation to verbal abuse to an incident where Affleck allegedly broke into a female cinematographer’s hotel room and snuck into her bed. (For more detailed information on the complaints filed against Affleck, the Daily Beast has published an in-depth account of the events.)Both women ended up settling lawsuits against Affleck, and the entire incident had little-to-no public impact — until now.It should be no surprise that members of the industry are hesitant to condemn Affleck for his alleged past abuse of women, considering the list of popular actors and directors in Hollywood with similar histories of suspected abuse and mistreatment.Some of them are so well known that they have become punch lines, like Woody Allen and Sean Penn. Others fly far more under the radar, thanks to quietly handled issues of domestic abuse or accounts of general mistreatment: Michael Fassbender, Gary Oldman, Sean Bean and Nicolas Cage, to name a few.Just look at Johnny Depp. In the span of a year, he went from being accused of violent domestic abuse to landing a huge role in the “Harry Potter” cinematic universe. Is this how Hollywood rewards men who are accused of violence toward women?Yes it is.That’s why the swift condemnation of Nate Parker was so surprising. Granted, being accused of rape is a far cry from domestic abuse or sexual misconduct on set, but where does Hollywood draw the line?If Parker’s alleged victim hadn’t killed herself, or if he hadn’t publicly drawn so many parallels between his own life and his passion project, would Hollywood have overlooked his past? What made his crimes so very different from those of other successful men in the industry?An obvious answer to that question would be to point to his race. Nate Parker is a black director who made a film about a violent black uprising in early American history. How much did his race play into the fact that he has been shunned by Hollywood? If Affleck wasn’t a famous white man, would his own case be playing out differently?Parker’s career is, by all accounts, over. If Hollywood has decided that it is going to treat all alleged rapists and sexual predators in the same way, then Parker’s treatment was absolutely just.But if Casey Affleck walks onto that stage in February and accepts his Oscar for Best Actor, despite general knowledge of the accusations against him, the entertainment industry will yet again have rewarded an alleged sexual predator with the highest honor they can give.And the audiences and media who propel him to the top will be just as complicit as the voters who hand him the prize.',\n",

       "  'body': 'In the 1980s, a campaign for international human rights sprouted from highlighted instances of domestic violence and sexual assault around the world.The campaign was called “Thursdays in Black” and was a way for people to support women’s right to live in a world without violence, rape and fear. It later sparked the annual event Purple Thursday, which took place Oct. 20, 2016, for the 11th time, for Domestic Violence Awareness Month in the United States.Middle Way House, a shelter in Bloomington for those affected by domestic violence and sexual assault, is one of many organizations that celebrated Purple Thursday. In addition to celebrating Purple Thursday, Middle Way House has coordinated many other sexual violence prevention events and programs this year.An education and advocacy center for the community, Middle Way House’s work continues beyond Domestic Violence Awareness Month and through post-election tension.Established as a non-profit in 1971, Middle Way House’s model prioritizes strength-building. It is one of six National Model Domestic Violence programs. Middle Way House’s work with clients emphasizes achieving stability and independence from abusive relationships.“We work on an empowerment model and want victims to make the choices that are best for themselves,” community programs coordinator Debra Morrow said.While the organization aims to stop domestic violence perpetrated against anyone, they pay particular attention to its disproportionate effects on women, Morrow said. According to a 2011 report by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, one in three Indiana women have been affected by violence within an intimate partnership.Throughout October, Middle Way House had events to raise awareness of domestic violence and raise funds to support survivors. Among them were the XO Variety Show at the Bishop, which featured a lineup of local artists and performers; a panel on abuse and technology at the IU School of Global and International Studies; and other fundraisers throughout town.The organization also had its Eighth Anniversary Benefit Show at the Comedy Attic. Jesse Eisenberg, who works with the organization, was the host of the show.In November, Middle Way House was host to Hands Across the Trail, a rally to fight against sexual assault violence in public spaces around Bloomington. The rally emphasized the importance of bystander intervention and included speakers such as professor Dawn Johnsen of the Maurer School of Law and former Rachael’s Cafe owner Rachael Jones.“The election has made people more insecure, and, as an agency, we want people to recognize that we will work to end violence in our community,” Morrow said.Middle Way House is a member agency of the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence in Indianapolis.Colleen Yeakle, prevention initiatives coordinator of ICADV, said the coalition maintains supportive relationships with domestic violence prevention centers across the state by providing information, training and technical assistance. As parts of a statewide alliance network, ICADV and Middle Way House work closely together, she said.Morrow said Middle Way’s crisis line calls have increased since the election. The shelter has been tracking hate crime calls to make distinctions between reports reflecting patterned domestic violence and those reflecting hate crimes, she said.Yeakle said in the midst of intensified fears, it’s important to remember the perpetrators don’t represent the general sentiment.“The people who are participating in hate crimes are outliers,” she said. However, it’s important to take each act of violence seriously.“If we create connections in communities that prevent violence, we can stop other forms of violence,” she said.These connections can also attract positive involvement for a range of social issues, she said.Yeakle said campaign initiatives in recent years have focused more on messages of connection and support and less on violence statistics. “We should be showing every person that they have a role to play,” she said.Morrow said that she wants those affected by violence of any kind to know the social service agencies of Bloomington are concerned and working for them.She said Middle Way House is continuing its prevention work as always in accordance with its mission statement.“The ultimate hope is that it’s not always just damage control when a situation arises,” Morrow said, “But that we can reach a point from preventing domestic violence.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Depression is the new craze, right?I couldn’t believe when I read several tweets discussing how depression is the new fad.These series of tweets came after the recent news of Kanye West being hospitalized due to his extreme depression and paranoia causing situational psychosis.Kanye is not the first celebrity to admit to suffering from a mental illness this year.Many mixed responses, including support, confusion and even blatant disrespect for Kanye and his illness, have come since his hospitalization.Lady Gaga recently revealed she has been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder during an interview with the Today Show.Celebrities, now more than ever, feel they can share with the public what is going on in their lives. Yes, we have seen their personal lives for years and years, but this is a new form of personal.There has always been a stigma against mental illness, and it is obviously not going away any time soon. Despite this, people are trying to bring awareness to mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety.Fans, especially, have been supportive of celebrities. They often are able to relate to their idols who suffer from the same or similar illnesses.The popular response to people opening up about their depression or anxiety is saying “Go outside,” “Don’t be sad,” or “It’s not that bad.” Most of the people who respond this way have probably never suffered from depression, or if they have, they received the same responses.People wonder why the youth today are so sad or dramatic but refuse to ask what causes them to feel this way or acknowledge that they may have a part of it.It’s almost shocking to read about different traumas that affect young teenagers and lead to the crippling combination of anxiety and depression.A combination of environment, heritability and life choices affects how susceptible teenagers and young adults are to mental illnesses like depression and anxiety.Seventy-five percent of people who have suffered from anxiety say they had their first experience with the mental illness by the age of 22.I don’t want to say every college student deals with anxiety on a daily basis, but a vast majority deal with it frequently.Depression and anxiety may be the most common ones to occur among young adults, but more disorders and mental illnesses can result if they are left untreated or if more stress is added.Of course, some illnesses are biological and hereditary, but they are typically triggered by one event or another.Because of this, it is important to keep an eye out on the people we love.We tweet about how we support Kanye West, Kid Cudi and sexual assault survivors like Ke$ha, yet we don’t recognize these same things happening to our loved ones.I appreciate celebrities coming out and not being afraid to share their need for help with the public. It’s incredibly brave and a great step toward becoming mentally healthy or the best they can be.Reading up on mental illnesses and how they manifest certainly doesn’t make you an expert or a therapist, but it is helpful so you can understand why your friend may act the way they do.Let’s not make fun of celebrities or call depression a trend.Let’s help each other move forward.mmgarbac@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'In the past few days, a lot of questions have gone unanswered about IU Coach Kevin Wilson’s departure from IU.Why did he resign?Why would he leave millions of dollars on the table and settle for about half a million?What did he do?Many current and former players have come forward with stories of all kinds about Wilson. Those stories have commended his character and described his love for his players and their disbelief regarding the end of his IU career. A lot of typical we-love-you-coach type stuff.On the other hand, some former players wrote on Twitter and told the Indiana Daily Student about Wilson’s downfalls. He allegedly pressured players to play through injuries and built a culture of fear to discourage reporting these injuries.Like with most of IU’s other flaws — things like Alpha Tau Omega’s video leak and other campus sexual assaults — that get national attention, this isn’t just an IU problem. It’s a national problem.IU isn’t the only school with fraternity problems. IU isn’t the only school with sexual assault problems. It likely isn’t the only school with a problematic coach, either.In 2009, Mike Leach was fired from Texas Tech after refusing to apologize to a player he allegedly forced into a storage closet as punishment. That same month, Kansas’ Mark Mangino was asked to resign amid allegations of verbal and physical abuse of players.This problem even exists among Big Ten programs in cases like Rutgers’ Mike Rice, Ohio State’s Woody Hayes and most recently Illinois’ Tim Beckman, who was dismissed just before the 2015 season after accusations similar to Wilson’s arose. However, North Carolina still picked up Beckman as a volunteer assistant. He resigned after the rest of the world realized North Carolina was OK with having someone who neglected his players’ injuries.This calls to mind Liberty University’s recent hiring of former Baylor Athletic Director Ian McCaw, who resigned as a scandal unfolded involving allegations that athletes had been repeatedly accused of sexual assault and administrators did nothing.All these hirings and firings lead to one question. How much do colleges care about their athletes?I believe IU Athletics Director Fred Glass is a nice guy who probably does care about athletes individually. Otherwise, the department wouldn’t have let go of a coach who took a team from 1-11 to 6-6. It would have held him tight as long as the problems weren’t public.The NCAA will say it cares about athletes, too. However, to the institution, players are just dollar signs.Billions of dollars circulate in and out of the NCAA. Players don’t see that money.Yes, they do get an education or at least part of one, but other than that, not much.Coaches are paid millions to tear them apart mentally and physically. As long as they get results, who cares? Look at Bobby Knight: years and years of televised tantrums and other alleged abuse, but the University didn’t fire him until 2000 — long past his prime.In the NCAA’s 2010 Growth, Opportunities, Aspirations, and Learning of Students in College survey, 31 percent of men’s basketball players and 22 percent of football players somewhat or strongly agreed their head coach puts them down in front of others. Only about half said their head coaches could be trusted.These questions did not reappear on the 2015 report of the study.What universities don’t realize, though, is it’s not just the student athletes being hurt by this. In a study published by the American Psychological Association, researchers found athletes with abusive coaches are more willing to cheat than athletes with more ethical coaches.I get it. Sports are rough. A lot of former athletes say their angry coaches made them better. The older generation has the whole, “Well, back in my day ...” thing going for it where they played until they physically could not stand, and then some.However, medical technology has advanced. We know CTE is a thing. We know injuries like blood clots are not to be taken lightly.We don’t know for sure why Wilson resigned, but if these allegations of ignoring injuries and putting down those injured are true, perhaps it’s best the athletic department stepped up and said something about the first coach in 25 years to lead the Hoosiers to back-to-back bowl games.It’s a step in the right direction.',\n",

       "  'body': 'He was familiar with the tolls of space and time: in 2012 it was 7,200 miles, the distance his daughter Bingbing had traveled to arrive at the Kelley School of Business.It was as many time zones away as one can get and by longitude nearly the exact opposite side of the earth.Multiply distance by the months apart.The disconnect had frayed them. Hongjin and his wife, Fuxia Zhao, had never been to the United States. He had seen stories on social media of Americans beating Chinese. He worried about sexual assault but couldn’t bear to mention it by name.They called every day.After a year of this, his wife demanded to go see things for herself.Another year, and Bingbing pitched them a crazy idea. It would take $200,000.By 2015, they had uprooted their lives in China, and that crazy idea became brick and mortar, spice and oil.***Bingbing had arrived three years before with little English and less direction. When she wandered into her professor’s office to ask for a reference letter, he asked her what she’d accomplished.She couldn’t think of anything.“I was doing what everyone else was doing,” she said.Verbalizing it flared her ambition. Newly arrived, still unsure of her language abilities or place at school, she threw herself into Bloomington’s flagship tradition — the annual Little 500 bike race. She laid the groundwork to found an all-Chinese cycling team, the Young Pioneers, but it needed money badly.Meanwhile, in China, Hongjin and his wife were bored and anxious.As a father, he said he felt it was his job to secure his children’s futures — but he also wondered what was left for him and his wife.He heard his daughter’s dream. He and his wife missed her terribly.Therefore, he gave his Shanghai noodle shop to his little brother, and he and his wife made the move.For years, the building on Third Street, half-buried, had drawn beatniks to coffee and spoken word. On Aug. 20, 2015, what had been Rachael’s Café opened as Gourmet Garden.***Hongjin talking about food is like Neil deGrasse Tyson talking about comets. He babbles about boneless fish, rails against General Tso’s, zips between topics and repeats himself. If he could, he would send United States’ peddlers of strip mall Chinese food to the Hague.“We want to create a platform for you to taste real, regional Chinese food,” he said.When explaining all this to an American, he uses “you” like a priest sniffing out a convert, square glasses bobbing up and down.“We don’t want you eating General Tso’s,” he said, again. “You don’t understand what spicy is, what not spicy is,” he said. His wiry hands punctuate it.Fuxia agrees. One evening, she waits on two locals. When she realizes they speak Chinese, a grin splits her face and she recommends the best things on the menu.“You like spicy?”“Yeah.”“Do 44. Much spicier.”They’re not exaggerating. Chilis hide in the shredded pork like triggerfish in coral, waiting to strike. The menu boasts ox blood and lamb testicle, pork knuckle and duck intestine. The prices are unapologetic — if you want $7 plates, head to Longfei across the street, with its 24-item menu all in English.Their first chef, in fact, was considered a culinary prince. He was the son of a cook who they say had served Premier Zhou Enlai, the second most powerful man in Mao’s China. He wasn’t good enough, so they replaced him six months in.Hongjin relates the depth of food to the depth of the challenge he and his wife face every day. “The biggest trouble is language,” he said.Cooking for him is a type of translation, the chasm standing between the U.S. understanding of Chinese food — lo mein, sugar-crusted donut balls, a buffet with jello — and the cuisine’s true soul.“When you translate Chinese to English, you lose things,” Hongjin said. “A lot of meaning is lost.”Chinese cuisine is one of the oldest on earth. It has evolved through ages through billions of cooks. This tradition plays about the corners of Hongjin’s mouth when he talks about king crab or Sichuan spice.Only one other topic makes him smile the way food does. Only one other thing makes him as proud.***Bingbing is now 2,000 miles away in California. She translated her entrepreneurial spirit to an internship at Disney. Her English is now nearly flawless. Her parents still feel her distance.“When they were in China, I relied on them every day,” Bingbing says. “Ever since they came to the United States, they rely on me.”They call her nearly every day. She flies back almost once a month.To get an idea of her parents’ concern, which they express only in Chinese and the lines of their faces, for her, one can listen to her concern for her parents.“They don’t get to rest,” she said. “I want them to take a break and do something else, but my mom worries too much about the business. Their health is the most thing I worry about.”Hongjin and Fuxia have a new sort of home now. Chinese students are a constant feature at the restaurant. The staff comprises skinny, middle-aged men and women in neutral polo shirts with sleeves twice the size of their biceps.The last guests leave, but new plates come from the kitchen. Fuxia conveys them with vast boats of soup and sauce to the table. Steam whirls around her arms.The sinks in the back hush, the stoves die down. Within seconds the mother and six men and women have converged around the table. Almost nothing is said. The only language is the tap of chopsticks and the slurping of broth.Hongjin, late to communion, is the only one sitting apart. His mind is elsewhere. His hands are still knit together.It took $200,000 to open the restaurant. Perhaps $200,000 could also fund a bike team, but perhaps that wasn’t the only goal all along.He smiles, remembers himself and grabs a bowl with the rest of the crew.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Students Against State Violence interrupted a Board of Trustees meeting Wednesday to voice their demands regarding the police, sexual assault, social justice and IU as a sanctuary campus.The SASV walked in during Provost Lauren Robel’s IU-Bloomington campus report and interrupted her to begin the statement.“Dissolve the IUPD and the IU Police Academy, and redirect their funding toward educational resources for underrepresented minority students and faculty and students from low-income backgrounds,” junior Keenan Rhodes read from the statement.Other SASV members voiced different parts of the statement. They said students should be required to undergo an investigation or face immediate suspension if accused of sexual assault.The general education, the group said, should be restructured to “ensure an ongoing education in social justice for students, staff and faculty.”Finally, the group said all IU campuses should become sanctuaries for undocumented people.Following SASV’s statement, the board asked for a copy of its demands. One of the group members unfolded her paper and handed it to one of the trustees. SASV walked out of the room after the statement had been made, and the trustees continued their meeting.The Board of Trustees met for the first of two days of meetings. Trustees approved new degrees at other IU campuses and listened to various reports from faculty as well as students.Robel gave a report on the Bloomington campus. She talked about the Class of 2020 and the recent actions in response to the bicentennial. Robel shared developments and highlights in IU-Bloomington’s strategic plan.She said IU’s residential community is vibrant, and the students are diverse, global and academically prepared.Robel talked about how the study abroad program has increased. Thirty percent of students now study abroad, Robel said. One hundred twenty-three low-income, first-generation and/or underrepresented minority students were sent to study abroad this year.“Most of these students haven’t been overseas,” Robel said. “Most haven’t even been on a plane.”Sara Zaheer, IU Student Association president, and Adam Reneker, Graduate and Professional Student Government president, talked about student mental health issues.Zaheer talked about how the counseling services are free for the first two sessions, but they are often booked and appointments are set back weeks.IU Health Center funds have only gone up by 20 cents since 2011. Because the population and need for counseling have both increased, Zaheer and Reneker asked that the project receive more attention.“The student health fee is an issue. It hasn’t gone up in a while,” Robel said. “We have been putting money into this, although it may not show up.”In other business, trustees approved of the Merger of Kinsey Institute, an action introduced during the Executive Session of the meeting.According to the agreement and plan of the merger, the Kinsey Institute and IU will be merged into a single entity.Trustees will meet again Thursday morning to discuss finance and approve projects. The board will also be discussing topics surrounding IU-Purdue University Fort Wayne.',\n",

       "  'body': 'As the semester is coming to a close, some students are panicking.Memes are circling around the internet about bringing grades from a D+ to an A-. Everyone and their mother is having a mental breakdown.If anyone is wondering, it may be possible. However, the issue many students are facing is they aren’t aware catching up is an option. A lot of students believe that if they’re behind, that’s it. Game over.There is such a stigma surrounding what happens if you turn an assignment in late or not at all.I know I have definitely felt this way, so I can account for it.Professors and teacher assistants are generally very understanding about issues concerning mental health, physical health and even genuine misunderstandings.The best way to find out if your professor falls under this category is to talk to them.Email them, go to their office hours, stop them after class — do whatever you can to get across that you are in need of their help or even an extension.Most professors I’ve had make an announcement at the beginning of each semester telling students that if anything comes up that prevents them from performing as well as they can, to let them know immediately.This includes any type of mental illness. Yes, including anxiety.Professors want you to succeed in their classes, as much as they may make you think they are hell-bent on making this the worst semester of your life.Sure, it may seem daunting if you are in a class with two hundred other students. This is where TAs come in handy.Many zeros in the gradebook can at least be brought up to a fifty percent, and surprisingly, that can do wonders for your grade.Another great resource for students that many aren’t aware of is the Student Advocates Office.They help students with all types of issues and work with the University on the student’s behalf. If you’re having an issue with a professor, or other students (whether it be social, sexual assault or a misunderstanding), student advocates can provide you with help.Maybe you have had to miss a bunch of classes because you’re going through something.That’s okay. Student advocates along with Counseling and Psychological Services can work with you to help your professors understand what you’re going through.So, instead of wallowing in the self-disgust you have from not turning in six finite assignments, or crying yourself to sleep after failing your fourth quiz in a foreign language class, talk to your professor.Talk to CAPS. Talk to student advocates.You can take charge of your schoolwork.If you manage to pull off passing all of your classes exceptionally or even averagely, you will feel so much better knowing you tried.But above all, your mental health and physical health are the most important things you need to take care of.Don’t let finals season bog you down so badly that you can no longer function in a healthy manner.Sleep well.Eat well.And take a shower.mmgarbac@umail.iu.edu@uma_merman',\n",

       "  'body': 'Alfred Hitchcock was known by many in the film community as the master of suspense, but actress Tippi Hedren’s recent book, “Tippi: A Memoir,” reveals it was more than just the filmmaker’s craft that was bestial.For anyone who has seen a Hitchcock film, it’s pretty evident the man had an unnatural obsession with killing women in his movies. He had a particular affinity for blondes in this regard.“Blondes make the best victims,” Hitchcock once said. “They’re like virgin snow that shows up the bloody footprints.”Even for the man who directed “Psycho,” that’s creepy.According to Hedren’s new book, Hitchcock was no more charming in person during the few years she knew him. Hitchcock had apparently discovered her through a non-speaking role she had in a TV diet-drink commercial, and he insisted that Universal Studios find her and bring her to him.Upon meeting Hedren, the director hired her at once for “The Birds,” his planned follow-up to “Psycho.” Hedren wrote that Hitchcock would attempt to regulate her diet and even ordered her “Marnie” co-star Sean Connery to not touch her at any point during shooting.Also during the shooting of “The Birds,” Hitchcock allegedly attempted to embrace and kiss Hedren in a limo in front of a crowded hotel.She successfully avoided this unwanted encounter, but the director supposedly got his revenge the day after through the filming of the movie’s famous telephone booth scene, where the killer birds try to break in through the glass surrounding Hedren.It looks like the director had been watching too many of his own movies.Since the publishing of Hedren’s memoir, many Hitchcock experts and fans have come out in defense of the renowned director. All of them have been male.Apparently it’s easier to believe that an 86-year-old actress is still seeking attention than that a notoriously sleazy director could have assaulted at least one of his actresses.Hitchcock biographer John Russell Taylor said in an interview with the Guardian there were several months separating the attempted kiss and the phone booth filming.He also said it would make no sense that Hitchcock would try seeking revenge against Hedren, as that would only disfigure her.Hedren’s hairdresser Virginia Darcy, however, said she supported Hedren’s claims and mentioned that the whole crew was looking out for the actress.During the shooting of “Marnie,” Hedren said Hitchcock told her about a recurring dream he was having of her in his living room, telling him how her heart belongs to him. He said if it weren’t for his wife, Alma, he would be with her.Hedren asked Hitchcock to stop, but he didn’t comply and leaned into her ear to confess his twisted idea of love for her. It’s an image that seems to come straight out of “Vertigo,” and perhaps Jimmy Stewart’s obsessive character was autobiographical.It didn’t get any better after that. After a shooting, Hedren claims in her memoir that Hitchcock randomly grabbed her and touched her all over.“It was sexual, it was perverse and it was ugly, and I couldn’t have been more shocked or repulsed,” Hedren said.This was the final straw for her. Hedren said she immediately cancelled her contract with Hitchcock and never saw the man again.“Don’t let a situation get to the point where you can’t control it,” Hedren said. “Ever.”While Hedren has escaped her abuse, there are still thousands of women throughout the history of Hollywood who have suffered from the abuse of their silver-screen higher-ups. Hedren herself didn’t bloom too many years from the days when women had to sleep with producers in order to be secured a role.After Hitchcock, there has still been a considerable amount of misogynistic treatment from directors. Rose McGowan practically quit acting after an Adam Sandler film audition required her to be dressed in a bikini.Also, what was the last Christopher Nolan film you’ve seen where a woman wasn’t already dead, killed or completely sidelined? That’s right. None. And let us not forget the fact that there has yet to be a female character in a Michael Bay movie whose purpose is anymore than eye candy.However, Hedren said she believes women today have the ability to fight back against this sexism.“I think they’ve become stronger,” Hedren said. “They certainly have the right to be stronger. If they don’t use that right, I have nothing to say to them.”afaulds@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Saturday afternoon, in the 43-degree weather, more than 100 people gathered at Showers Plaza outside City Hall to raise awareness of sexual assault.Rachel Himsel, a Bloomington resident and singer, was performing the song for the beginning of Hands Across the Trail, an event put on by Middle Way House to promote safety in public spaces and an end to sexual violence.Middle Way House is a resource center where women and children who have suffered domestic abuse go for support and information.Himsel said the song is a constant reminder for her about what still needs to be done by every member of the community.“Am I perfect?” Himsel said. “No, but I’m trying to be better every day.”Musicians, speakers and poets all came together on Saturday to help Middle Way manage the event. Actor Jesse Eisenberg was also in attendance and played the drums as a band member.Hands Across the Trail was meant to help bring people together and say sexual assault and violence in public spaces is not acceptable, Himsel said.“We’re here to say enough is enough,” Himsel said.Himsel said she had her own stories of sexual assault and understood what it was like to feel helpless. She said she was on a red eye flight when the man next to her brought his hand up to her inner thigh during the flight.“It happens to too many people,” Himsel said.The event started off as an idea from a Facebook post by Aubrey Seader, a Bloomington resident, who said she had to find a way to deal with her fear and anger.Seader recalled a rape reported during the middle of the day before on the same trail the event was being taken place. Seader said she was shocked and appalled from the initial news.“In broad daylight on a public trail, I had to worry about being raped,” Seader said.Seader said the next time she wanted to go outside and workout, she just felt this cold fear settle in and she was tired of that feeling. She said she could not go on living in a city where public spaces were not safe.“I would no longer accept a Bloomington where acts like that could happen,” Seader said.Donna Storm, an employee at Middle Way for 11 years, also said how happy she was people had come out to the event but that she wished the event was unnecessary.“I think it’s troubling we even have to have this event,” Storm said.Storm said she thought the key to coming together and ending violence, especially sexual violence, was by using empathy and being willing to call out people who perpetuate the culture with their words or actions.“We need to put ourselves in other people’s shoes,” Storm said. “The root of respect is empathy.”The event was also designed to be non-partisan. Seader said the event is just about coming together and it is not about which political party you support.“It’s not a partisan issue,” Seader said. “No matter what side of the aisle divides us, we all want to come together.',\n",

Safety is the most basic of rights, and each of us deserves to be as secure as possible in our surroundings. Public safety is my first concern as mayor.”Local activist Aubrey Seader said she wanted to take action and raise awareness so she and others can continue to use the trail without fear of attack.“We’re often told that, as individuals, we are solely responsible for keeping ourselves safe and that if we’re attacked we probably could have been more cautious,” Seader said in the release.Seader said she thinks the community could be doing more to end rape culture in Bloomington.“I think if we’re going to ask women not to run alone, we have to have a long-term plan to end a culture that makes running alone unsafe,” Seader said.Seader connected with Middle Way to create an event that would examine community responsibility, bystander intervention and other issues around sexual assault awareness and prevention.With the addition of the city on board, the event has grown to include a rally that will feature speakers, musicians and poets, followed by a human-chain created on the B-Line to show the Bloomington community will not accept violence in public spaces, according to the release.Speakers scheduled for the event include Middle Way House prevention staff member Gabrielle Schiller and triage specialist Donna Storm. The rally will also feature original poetry from teen poets in Bloomington High School South’s “Outspoken” poetry club.Middle Way House staff will also provide tables where citizens can learn more about bystander intervention, consent culture, healthy communication in relationships and Middle Way’s Sexual Assault Advocacy program.Staff will also have a safe place for people to speak privately about concerns or questions, according to the release.Alyson Malinger',\n",

       "  'body': 'Virtual reality gaming is intended to be an escape from everyday life. Often, the games take place in fantastical landscapes, where players complete tasks and perform feats they never would have been able to do in reality.However, there are some nasty realistic things that exist even in digital worlds where you have to fight off zombies from castles and fortresses.Jordan Belamire, a woman playing the game QuiVr, reported she was virtually sexually assaulted within minutes of testing out the gameplay.Another user virtually rubbed her character’s chest and grabbed at her butt and genitals. He chased her when she ran away and ignored her when she told him to stop — all within the game.The reason? While her character looked just like every other character in the game, other players in the multiplayer version could hear her voice. Her female-sounding voice.Virtual reality, or VR, glasses and gaming systems make every experience in the game seem as real as possible, as players control their characters with their own bodies and see everything from a first-person perspective.That made the other player — comically and almost too perfectly called BigBro442’s — groping seem just as real as it would have been if they were on the sidewalk instead of in the forest.Upon hearing about Belamire’s experience, QuiVr developer Jonathan Schenker instituted a “personal bubble” setting to protect players. Anyone who plays the game can set their ideal distance to maintain around themselves. If another player got too close to them that player would simply “fade out of existence.”If only it were that easy in the real world.The biggest issue here is that there is literally no safe space from the threat of sexual assault. Even when you are alone in your house playing video games, someone can reach out and “touch” you inappropriately.The culture that makes it OK for women to be objects of these kind of inappropriate actions simply because they are women pervades even into a world completely different from our physical world.It’s scary to think that within VR, often a mechanism for people to play out fantasies and adventures, someone’s idea of a good time is to assault a woman. Online, there are no rules. The worst that could happen is they may be kicked out of the game.Many have attributed VR sexual assault to the fact that gaming is often a male-dominated activity.But women ages 18 and over make up about 31 percent of the gaming world, according to the Entertainment Software Association.So the problem is not because there are men online. The problem is that people do not feel like their actions have repercussions online, even though they may still be able to traumatize others.Assault is not OK anywhere. Not at school, not at work and not in virtual reality.meickhof@indiana.edu@maggie_eickhoff',\n",

       "  'body': 'On Oct. 25, conservative firebrand and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich was a guest on Fox News’ “The Kelly File” last week to discuss the Donald Trump campaign.Considering Fox News’ status as the most prominent conservative voice in media, some may be surprised to see Gingrich engage in a pouty, accusatory tirade against Megyn Kelly, the show’s host and a rising star in journalism.During the exchange, Kelly, who became a household name after her aggressive questioning of Trump during an August 2015 Republican primary debate, referenced Trump’s comments condoning sexual assault. As a hardline Trump ally, Gingrich instantly grew perturbed. He pointed to a lack of coverage on Bill Clinton’s sexual indiscretions and Hillary Clinton’s paid speeches to a bank in Brazil as proof that Kelly and her collegues are “fascinated by sex” and uninterested with providing substantive content.This awkward exchange is strange on many levels.First, it highlights the changing landscape of the two-party system. As stated, Fox News and Gingrich are conservative icons, and the clash between the two accentuates the fractures in the fabric of the Republican party.To an extent, the two parties represent two starkly distinct types of conservatives. Gingrich, as a Trump supporter, represents the old guard, while Kelly, who is known by many for her lack of alignment with the GOP nominee, represents younger, more moderate individuals that are turned off by the likes of Bill O’Reilly and other traditional conservative talking heads.The exchange further proves Gingrich — and the faction of the party he represents — is out of touch. Members of both parties tend to agree with Kelly that stories like Trump’s “Access Hollywood” tape and accusations of sexual assault are absolutely worthy of coverage.To Gingrich’s point, Trump is not a convicted sexual predator, and maybe the media ought not to treat him as if he is. Putting the scores of accusers who have corroborated each other’s stories and audio recordings in which Trump literally incriminates himself aside, Gingrich believes the focus should be on decades-old episodes involving not the Democratic nominee herself, but her husband, who is vying for the unofficial title of First Gentleman. Which is, of course, totally reasonable.In all seriousness, the speeches referred to by Gingrich are worthy of more scrutinous coverage, but the absurdity of the rest of his narrative destroys any credibility he had to develop a reasonable argument.This behavior shouldn’t surprise anyone. In August, Gingrich countered factual evidence that violent crime was at its lowest point in years by saying, “That’s your view.”The former House Speaker certainly cares little for objective journalism.On the other hand, many have posited about what episodes like these could signify for the future of Fox News. Following the exchange, some accused Kelly, whose contract with the network is set to expire next summer, of taking advantage of the forum to “audition” for more prominent roles with a major network like ABC News.If Fox News is to extend its reach beyond its core following, comprised largely of older white Americans, it would be smart to try to retain Kelly. To appeal to younger voters, who tend to be more middle-of-the-road or liberal, Fox needs more Megyn Kellys and fewer Bill O’Reillys.Regardless of how one feels about the individuals involved, the exchange was an embarrassing display of Gingrich and Co.’s blind adherence to a losing agenda that has the GOP in jeopardy of losing the presidency and both houses of Congress on Nov. 8.',\n",

       "  'body': 'With a mix of Beyoncé, Destiny’s Child and Ariana Grande playing in the background, Feminist Student Association leaders handed out paper for people to compose letters, some addressing them to the Trump campaign office in New York.Three weeks ago, the Washington Post published a tape in which Donald Trump made derogatory marks about a former love interest and said the now-infamous “Grab ’em by the pussy” line, so IU Feminist Student Association decided to make a statement of their own Thursday evening.At Pussies Grab Back, an event hosted by FSA, around 15 people wrote letters to Trump and other politicians about their concerns this election, especially with regard to Trump’s comments on women.“We try to be non-partisan,” IU Feminist Association President Carmen Vernon said. “But Trump is so alienating.”Vernon said different groups around the country have adopted this notion of “Pussies Grab Back” and have been writing to Trump and other politicians.The Pussies Grab Back meeting began by showing attendees the music video for Pussy Riot’s song “Straight Outta Vagina.”For IU student Stephanie Whitlock, not only are the letters a way to express her thoughts on Trump, but they serve as an emotional outlet. Whitlock is involved in other campus activist groups, including Students for a Democratic Society.“I hate Donald Trump with everything I am,” Whitlock said. “It’s really therapeutic to get down in words. We are not the only people doing this.”Whitlock focused her letter on her personal experiences with sexual assault and harassment.She said the way Trump speaks and acts towards women only validates the views of the people who assaulted her and reinforces the views of people who are against women.“He claims they’re just words,” Whitlock said.Another letter writer, Suzie Wilcox, said she acknowledges the fact that Donald Trump or someone from his campaign might not read the letters, but she still liked the idea of getting to “shit all over Donald Trump.”In her letter, she said she wrote about her anger towards Donald Trump’s consistent themes of degradation of women and xenophobia.“There are things in our culture that are kind of terrifying,” Wilcox said. “The amount of women that support him is really sad more than anything.”Wilcox said she hopes the influx of letters from around the nation make Trump aware of how appalled people are at his comments.The group also took videos of those who wanted to share their letters and plan to make a video compiling the individual clips.Vernon said that if Trump is elected, the FSA hopes to have more politically focused events, like the letter-writing campaign, aside from the rallies and other general meetings.“If he becomes president, which is a scary, scary thought, we will switch gears from lots of educational and other meetings to become more policy-focused,” Vernon said.In the meantime, the FSA is planning a carpool to “The Revolution Will Be Uterized” rally in Indianapolis on Nov. 2 to protest Trump and running mate Mike Pence.',\n",

       "  'body': 'After the sexual assault that was reported Oct. 15 at the Alpha Epsilon Pi House, the fraternity is planning to continue the different sexual assault education programs they have done in the past, said spokesperson of the fraternity’s national organization Jon Pierce.Pierce said AEPi has a very clear and strict policy about respect toward everybody, men and women included.“We do not in any shape or form condone sexual assault but also anything that makes people feel uncomfortable or is antithetical to our Jewish values,” Pierce said. “When there are incidents brought to us, we act swiftly.”Pierce said continuing programming for sexual assault education within chapters is important to the organization, and members of AEPi are also educated on the topic during the organization’s international conventions and regional conclaves.“We also have a number of our staff travel to meet with undergraduate chapters to talk about what our expectations are for behavior,” Pierce said.Sexual assault counselor with Counseling and Psychological Services Debbie Melloan said sanctions like suspension or expulsion are in many cases placed on fraternity members who are found through the IU system to have committed sexual assault, but those fraternities should take the opportunity to have more discussions and programs about sexual assault and consent.Fraternities who experience this could also try to discuss what might be missing in the recruitment process in terms of assessing who fits the example of what they want a brother to be, Melloan said.Melloan said she thinks there is always more everyone could do in terms of addressing the issue of sexual assault.“It’s an ongoing process, educating students about the different complexities connected to sexual assault,” Melloan said. “Bystander intervention is one piece, but there are other useful programs like ones that might look at topics like toxic masculinity.”Melloan named Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault, a group of Interfraternity Council chapter members who aim to engage and educate men about issues and rape of sexual assault, as a good tool to educate fraternity men on topics like these.“The bottom line is committing sexual assault is an individual thing and one person makes that choice, but I do think it’s important for fraternities to respond in appropriate and responsible ways when they’re aware a sexual assault has happened in their space or by one of their members,” Melloan said. “Whatever the consequences for them are should be different than a fraternity that tries to hide it or to silence a victim.”Sexual assault counselor at CAPS Ann Skirvin said in an email fraternity leaders are put in a tough position when a member is accused of sexual assault, but they should prioritize the needs of the survivor and hold members who are found to have committed a sexual assault accountable by terminating their membership from the fraternity.“I believe if fraternities kicked out problematic members with swift action, this would make a safer environment in the greek community,” Skirvin said in the email.Skirvin said she is aware that the things she recommends fraternities do to address this issue could result in organizations getting in trouble, being put on social probation or having other long term consequences.Skirvin said this creates what she would define as the binge/purge scenario of fraternities being better behaved while they are on probation, then binging with wild parties and more problematic behavior the second the sanctions are lifted.“In my opinion, this is not resolving problems and reforming the system of accountability for fraternities and sororities should be explored,” Skirvin said.Skirvin said fraternities often have lawyers or alumni advisers telling them what to do to stay out of trouble and protect the image of the organization, but do not prioritize what would improve the climate for members or guests of the chapters on campus.“I think it is problematic to hold the whole fraternity responsible for the actions of a few members or nonmembers acting on their own against the values of the fraternity,” Skirvin said. “However, if the fraternity is creating an environment where sexual assault is encouraged, facilitated, made a condition of membership, or rewarded, then I think the entire fraternity should be held accountable with strong long-term consequences.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The people you live with are supposed to be the people you can trust and feel safe with. They shouldn’t bring other people into your house or apartment that will make you uncomfortable. They definitely should not bring people into your house or apartment that will proceed to make rape and sexual assault jokes all night.And on top of all of that, you should be able to talk to your roommates about this.I received a text from a good friend of mine the other night about how upset she was that there were men in her house making rape jokes. These men were dating her roommates. I asked if there was any way she could explain to her roommates why this made her so uncomfortable.The atmosphere these men created made it so she didn’t feel right asking them to not talk that way in her own house. She believed that if she commented on it, then she would be the next girl they called nasty names and made rape jokes about.What’s wrong with a woman commenting on something that makes her uncomfortable? This is something I’ve been wondering for the last few weeks. What is it that makes women so afraid to discuss their discomfort?Honestly, I think it is the blatant apathy I have witnessed men express when it comes to rape culture. They can talk about rape so nonchalantly. They don’t bat an eye when they discuss what they would do to a woman if she was unconscious.They don’t miss a beat between talking about how much they love their mother and about how their ex-girlfriend was a “crazy bitch.”Rape culture isn’t the only issue America is barely acknowledging.Sure, domestic violence is taken seriously. But people have their own definitions of domestic violence.Violence doesn’t only come from a man or woman hitting their significant other. Violence can come in the form of threats or backhanded compliments meant to make you believe that no one else could love you like they do.The Twitter trend #MaybeHeDoesntHitYou tells the stories of many women and men who have encountered domestic abuse without the men ever laying a hand on them.I don’t only overhear rape jokes on the streets or in the classroom. I hear jokes about how a girl should “shape up or get hit.”Or sometimes “bros” will joke with each other about how they put their girlfriends down the night before.“She can’t feel too good about herself.”“I don’t like her to go out when she looks hot.”“I care about her, but I have to act like I don’t.”But why is that? Why can’t guys just treat girls the way they want to? Where did they learn to make fun of girls and crack jokes at their suffering?I think women learned to not voice their discomfort at the same time that men learned to say whatever they want about women. So long as women don’t feel comfortable in telling men to stop talking that way, they’re going to think it’s okay and keep doing it.Of course, this is no excuse.Men have no right to make jokes about rape, domestic violence, or the intelligence and worth of women. But I think we women should stand up for ourselves. If someone doesn’t like it, then that’s too bad.Embrace the nasty woman.mmgarbac@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'We are, at last, nearing the end of this election, for better or for worse. It has inarguably been the most vitriolic, divisive, tumultuous election in living memory. The presidential candidates of the two main parties are possibly the most hated in American history. The Democratic nominee is a consummate politician with a long history of being tied to corruption. Now, the revelation of her campaign emails and speeches has demonstrated Hillary Clinton’s true dishonesty to the world. Meanwhile, the Republican nominee’s campaign spiral has grown more disgusting and cruel with each passing day. Whether it be normalizing sexual assault or tolerating white supremacists, Donald Trump has shown himself to be a man with little regard for human rights or human decency. Many Americans look at Election Day in fear, frightened of what will happen to our country with either candidate at the helm.It doesn’t have to be this way. Our choices don’t have to be between two authoritarians elevated by corrupt parties. America can have an honest, decent president who stands for the rights of all people. To do this, we must abandon the status quo. The Democrats and Republicans are stuck in the past, and their monopoly on power is only dragging us down. In the latest Gallup poll, 40 percent of Americans identified as independents. Faced with two poor candidates, we must find a third way. Our choice for that third way is Libertarian Gary Johnson. He has had some gaffes in regards to foreign policy where he seeks peace and trade, but he has two traits in spades above Clinton and Trump: successful executive experience, and more importantly, a fundamental sense of decency. We call upon our fellow students to choose decency as well.Tyler CombsBloomington',\n",

       "  'body': 'Last week, IU attempted to prepare its students and staff for something that is certainly on the mind of every young person. It’s an uncontrollable, carnal force that we live with. It’s natural to have questions about it.IU Notify warned the event in question could begin with “a shaking that starts out to be gentle” but escalate quickly to a “violent jolt.”That’s right, we’re talking about earthquakes — incidences that, in Indiana, are about as likely as the election actually being rigged. Sorry, Donald.As in, the likelihood is very low. IU’s press release states that since 2001, only three earthquakes with a magnitude of at least five have occurred in southern Indiana.It’s noble for IU to take such an interest in our health and safety. Especially during our college years, it’s important to learn about measures we can take to protect ourselves and others.IU Notify’s plan to prepare everyone for this unlikely natural disaster was to interrupt classes last Thursday with a prompt for everyone to spend ten to fifteen minutes underneath their desks.Of course, this prompt was very easy for professor’s to ignore by clicking “Acknowledge” and continuing with their lesson plan.The reasoning for this drill was that southern Indiana is situated at a “crossroads of two significant seismic zones.” However, this is the first time IU has really participated in a drill like this, despite southern Indiana always being in the same place.If the seismic zones we are sitting on were as dangerous as they were made to seem last week, we should have heard of them by now.Meanwhile, we have not had an all-campus drill of this caliber for dangerous events with larger likelihoods, such as an active shooter or a blow dart bandit or a swift stampede of wildebeests.The earthquake “Shakeout” drill was not, of course, issued with any kind of ill will or desire to waste student and faculty time. It was simply a confusing decision that came all at once, causing students to ask questions about how big the threat of an earthquake actually is.It would be interesting to see IU put the energy surrounding this sort of campaign strategy into preparing students for things our campus actually struggles with.Perhaps a pop-up on Canvas that teaches you about how to handle your crippling student debt or a call for professors to carve out fifteen minutes of class time to have a frank discussion with students about sexual assault and consent.Regardless of what IU chooses to do with the potential success of this type of drill, we can agree on one thing: the literature on what to expect out of an earthquake uses some incredibly erotic language.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Almost a century ago, the 19th Amendment of the United States Constitution was passed, allowing women across the U.S. their first legal chance to vote in political elections.Now in 2016, a female presidency is seen as possible in the minds of many Americans, including Kate Cruikshank, the president of the League of Women Voters of Bloomington and Monroe County. The League of Women Voters is a nonpartisan group focused on voter rights and Cruikshank said her opinions regarding the candidates are not endorsements in any way. While American women have attempted to run for president since the early days of the women’s suffrage movement, Cruikshank said she believes it has been difficult for them to achieve this in what she considers to be a country built on white, male superiority.“It’s not a case of we’re all in this together and may the best man-slash-woman win,” Cruikshank said. “It’s may the best man win because women almost have to go beyond that in order to get on the same plateau.”]Cruikshank said she believes the Democratic candidate is the most qualified candidate ever to run for president, based on the life she has led and her decades-worth of experience.“She’s awfully intelligent and apparently has an incredible capacity for seeing the big picture,” Cruikshank said. “If she wins, it can be really exciting just to see that play out.”While Phyllis Finley, the president of the Monroe Country Republican Women, agrees that Clinton is a strong and intelligent woman, she said she strongly disagrees with Clinton’s pro-choice stance on abortion.As a mother and grandmother, Finley said she believes allowing a fetus to be aborted is a negative view of life for a woman. Her only exception to her pro-choice stance is if the mother’s life is in danger or if the child is significantly deformed.Along with that, Finley said she also believes Clinton did not have a strong personality as secretary of state. She said she believes the events of Benghazi, in which four American soldiers were killed in Libya, could have been prevented by the government.“It grieves me that we had four men in Benghazi that lost their lives because of negligence and the lack of leadership in that office to rescue those men,” Finley said.Finley said she is also not personally convinced of the prospect of a female president in the U.S. She said she believes women are often motivated by their emotions, and she doesn’t think a woman would be able to fill the position of a strong figurehead who is respected by all cultures.However, Republican candidate Donald Trump has had a significant number of controversies in the past regarding his alleged treatment of women. This includes a recently leaked video from 2005 where Trump brags to reporter Billy Bush about his sexual assaults toward women.While bothered by Trump’s remarks, Cruikshank said she is more disturbed by how his supporters can overlook what he has said about women.“I think the most frightening thing about Donald Trump saying all those things is that people don’t see it as a problem,” Cruikshank said. “He kind of has a sort of predatory personality, and that plays out particularly toward women.”If Clinton is elected, Cruikshank said she believes the biggest concern should be understanding why Trump’s supporters either overlooked or supported these remarks and how they can change their mindsets for the better.However, while Finley said she agrees some of these remarks have been harsh, she doesn’t think he truly has disrespect for women.“I don’t think he’s cruel to women,” Finley said. “I just think he too often speaks before thinking it through.”Instead, she said she is more concerned about the domestic abuse against women.Along with building a wall across the Mexican border, Finley said she also agrees with Trump’s policy of not allowing Syrian refugees to enter the country. She said she believes this will prevent not only terrorist acts, but also violence against women.“Women in this country should be standing up and screaming ‘We do not want refugees here that treat women the way the women in Europe have been treated by the refugees,’” Finley said.Under a Trump presidency, Finley said she believes he will respect women and women’s rights, not only on a work level, but also as human beings.On the other side, Cruikshank said she believes Clinton’s worldwide influence as a strong female will help her benefit women in the U.S.“She has been such a pioneer for women’s rights around the world that I imagine that will carry through in everything she does,” Cruikshank said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Children run around and play on Friday, safe inside the fence surrounding Fairview Elementary school playground. They, unlike their parents, are unaware that a Fairview bus driver was arrested earlier that week, disturbing this safe environment.The Bloomington Police Department arrested 43-year-old Timothy Poteat, the driver of bus 44, on Oct. 21 on charges of child exploitation and child molesting.BPD is encouraging anyone who has children on that bus to contact the police about anything unusual.One parent, Elke Acosta, expressed her disbelief as she picked her son up from school. Acosta said she prefers to pick her children up to avoid issues like bullying, but now she has another reason.“It’s crazy,” Acosta said. “You don’t know what he did on that bus.”Poteat was originally arrested Oct. 18 after he finished his bus route. Police began an investigation Oct. 11 after receiving a tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children stating child pornography was being accessed from a specific IP address. BPD then traced the IP address, the electronic signature of the images, to Poteat’s house.BPD searched Poteat’s home and found six phones, two computers and seven external hard drives. BPD Lt. Brad Seifers said they are still reviewing all of it for evidence.The day after Poteat was taken into custody, another report came indicating that Poteat had attempted to take photos of two sisters, ages 8 and 7, as they rode his bus.Poteat was originally released on bail from the first arrest but was then taken back into custody without the option of bond and was arrested a second time on charges of child molestation.The charges were added once pornographic photos and video were discovered on Poteat’s computer. BPD Lt. John Kovach said video and photo footage involving at least two girls younger than 14, were found on Poteat’s computer.Poteat’s ex-wife identified one of the juvenile girls as her daughter based on the photos, but she told police she did not believe the video was of her own daughter.Kovach said the photos and video showed the two girls and various sex objects which Poteat used to sexually assault them.Acosta said she did not understand the whole situation and how a school bus driver could do all these things. She said her plans to pick up her children each day have been reinforced after Poteat’s recent arrest.“You don’t know a person just because they drive a bus,” Acosta said.Andrew Clampitt, the public information officer for Monroe County Community School Corporation, said the school system is saddened by the news but is determined to maintain the safety of children.“The safety and security of our children,” Clampitt said. “That’s our first priority.”Every MCCSC employee goes through a background check, Clampitt said. Requirements for MCCSC bus drivers include being at least 21 years old, having a good driving record and undergoing periodic drug testing, according to job postings on the MCCSC website.“We run a background check on everyone, even me,” Clampitt said.Poteat’s criminal record includes seven separate traffic incidents, five of those involving speeding or failing to stop. These incidents go from April 2015 to as far back as March 1998. Poteat was hired as a bus driver trainee in January 2015 and underwent a background check at the time.Clampitt said he was unable to comment on what exactly was found in Poteat’s file as it was currently being used in the investigation.Clampitt said MCCSC has replaced Poteat and is working with BPD during the investigation, according to the press release.Acosta said the charges against Poteat just reinforce her belief that her children are safer if she takes them home each day.“You can’t protect them on a bus,” Acosta said. “I don’t know what goes on.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"In 2008, when 22-year old Stefani Germanotta first entered the mainstream as Lady Gaga, she was probably the most controversial pop artist of the past 20 years.Eight years later, the now-beloved star will soon be releasing her much-anticipated fifth LP “Joanne.” It has been two years since Gaga has released an album and three years since she released exclusively a dance album.If that somehow isn’t enough, it was announced at the end of September that Gaga would be performing at the 2017 Super Bowl Halftime Show.She previously sang the national anthem at this year’s Super Bowl, but now she is given the chance to follow in the footsteps of Prince, Madonna, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen by giving us an ecstatic and stunning show we will never forget.It’s hard to imagine a time where Gaga was actually disliked, given how larger-than-life her status is now.But early in her career, one would have thought the antics and oddities of the former New York nightclub performer would have made her the next Madonna.But she wasn’t Madonna. She was better.Gaga encouraged her listeners to explore their independence, acceptance and artistry.[Lady Gaga's ability to transform is what makes her so captivating | IDS Weekend]Time has not been kind to stars like Madonna and Britney Spears, but in the Babylonian age of Twitter criticism, Gaga still reigns as queen of the pop industry.The former two faced harsh scandals and criticism almost from day one, while the latter somehow managed to go almost a whole decade without serious public hate.With that said, Gaga’s “little monsters” were recently fearful that she may never perform again.Her aspirations of becoming a wife and mother consumed her shortly after becoming engaged to Taylor Kinney. Earlier this year, she even put off all plans for recording and engagement to focus on becoming pregnant.When the couple broke off their relationship in July, it seemed as if a massive weight had been lifted from Gaga’s shoulders.Shortly after, she released “Perfect Illusion” as a single and later did the same for “Million Reasons.”These two singles show a more soulful, vulnerable side of Gaga we have only seen glimpses of before in songs like “Speechless,” “Dope” and “Til It Happens to You.” Gaga has said this openness and soul-searching is present throughout “Joanne.”This sudden change in tone comes as no surprise to Gaga fans, however. Each of her previous albums have shown drastically different musical styles.“The Fame” was the Madonna-esque synthpop record. “Born this Way” was the New York nightclub record. “Artpop” was the, well, artistic record. And “Cheek to Cheek” was the jazz standards record with Tony Bennett.The record will feature collaborations with Florence Welch, Beck and Father John Misty. She will also be working with Tame Impala singer Kevin Parker and songwriting legend Mark Ronson in the writing process.Who could ask for a more perfect blend?It’s safe to say the doubt in most people’s minds about Gaga years ago has been replaced with a stronger level of devotion.Gaga’s sheer talent and unique performances play the most significant role in this, of course, but her activism and philanthropy have been equally appreciated in the hearts of her fans.From the very beginning, Gaga was open about her bisexuality and faithfulness toward the LGBT community. As such, songs like “Born this Way” have been held as anthems for members of the community.Gaga has also used her fame to champion for women’s rights and has openly discussed issues such as sexual assault and gender inequality. The former was the subject of her 2015 hit “Til It Happens to You,” which was recorded for the campus rape documentary “The Hunting Ground.”In Gaga’s music, listeners have managed to find a place where judgment and hate are nonexistent and inner-beauty and love are not only normal, but required.To be a freak is to be loved. ‘Cause, baby, you were born this way.afaulds@indiana.edu@a_faulds9615\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Mental health is a key concern for most college students. In 2013, about 11 out of 100,000 students between the ages of 15 and 24 died as a result of suicide, and there has been an increase in the percentage of psychological problem on campus in recent years.The Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State found that anxiety and depression are the most common medical diagnoses on college campuses. This fact is horrifying.However, while I thought this fact was bad, I was more shocked at why students say they were struggling. Students don’t feel that their colleges are doing enough, and I agree.A good amount of my friends have some symptoms of a mental illness — whether it’s anxiety, depression or obsessive compulsive disorder. This is fine — mental illness is an illness and should be treated as such. It’s not something to be ashamed of.The stigma of mental illness contributes greatly to people not wanting to talk about it or refusing to believe that they have it. However, many of these same friends refuse to seek treatment because they simply can’t afford the cost of counseling.Counseling is considered a luxury for many students, many of whom have to pay for their own rent and school. While the two free sessions per student provided by IU Counseling and Psychological Services are useful, they’re not enough.Counseling or therapy requires more than two sessions.IU has a lot of problems that it needs to combat. It needs to better its sexual assault services and work on making the internet more reliable, but it especially needs to work on its mental health services.It’s great that the school offers two free sessions. However, mental health disorders are diseases and should be treated as rigorously as the flu. CAPS needs to not only offer more sessions but also expand its services to be more inclusive of its general population: students.The IU Health Center is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. These are peak class hours, which means that it’s difficult for students to attend if they want to. Additionally, a suicide hotline for the school would be useful.While the national suicide hotline is always open — (800) 273-8255, for those who need it — offering one through the school may make students feel as though there is a more direct connection to the speaker.Mental illness is one of the most biggest risks for students our age. It should be taken seriously. Not only that, it should be fought vigorously by the school.There is nothing I find more discouraging than hearing depression levels in college are so high that it’s the leading cause of death for college-aged students.We can fight this disease, and we can do it well. IU needs to play its part. It needs to take care of its students. While none of these solutions will eliminate suicide, they could drastically reduce its rates.npatwari@indiana.edu',\n",

These are ours. | IDS]Skirvin asked the audience to share some ways they see rape-supportive culture around them.Sarah Nagy, senior associate director of the Office of First Year Experience Programs, said she consistently sees victim blaming based on the victim’s consumption of alcohol before an assault.Another staff member said she often hears people talk about the lives of rapists being ruined, which shifts responsibility of their crimes away from the perpetrators.Skirvin said the first person a sexual assault victim tells about their assault has an affect on whether or not that victim reports their assault.“If the first person someone tells blames or shames them, it often shuts that person down, but if they’re understanding and supportive, they’re more likely to report,” Skirvin said.Trigger warnings for sexual assault topics covered in classes are another way Skirvin said faculty can help accommodate students who have experienced assault.“I just think it’s important for people to have as much information as they can so they can make informed choices,” Skirvin said.Leslie Fasone, assistant dean of students of women’s and gender affairs, spoke about the problems the University has with students not reporting their sexual assaults and what might cause students not to report them.Fasone said lack of reporting can be an issue if underage students fear repercussions if they were at a party where alcohol was present.“Our sexual misconduct policy provides students with amnesty, but I don’t think many of our students know that,” Fasone said.Several audience members proposed investing in sexual assault prevention programs that last after freshman year would be effective in preventing sexual assaults, but Fasone said lack of funding is a problem preventing such an expansion.Associate Dean of Students and Title IX Deputy Coordinator Carol McCord explained how IU employees should go about reporting sexual assaults reported.Employees are obligated to report the date, nature of the incident, parties involved and any other additional information they have.McCord said employees should tell students they do not have to share additional information if they do not want to, but they have an obligation to share the information they have with a confidential victim advocate and the Office of Student Ethics.“Our job is to make sure you know about the support we are supposed to provide for everyone,” McCord said.Fasone and McCord explained why the University refers to sexual assault issues as sexual misconduct rather than sexual assault or rape.McCord said some students have voiced the opinion that using the term sexual misconduct dismisses or minimizes the seriousness of sexual assault and rape and said the University takes feedback on these issues into account.“We’re not trying to be dismissive, but we have had people say they didn’t report because they didn’t think what happened to them was rape,” McCord said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'On country roads outside Bloomington, houses are decorated with American flags and eagle statues. As people drive by, they may also see signs for Donald Trump and Mike Pence with the slogan “Make American Great Again.”Phyllis Henry, a Bloomington resident, has signs for Trump, Trey Hollingsworth for Indiana district 9 and Eric Holcomb for governor in her yard. She said she continues to support Trump despite his lewd comments because she was raised a conservative. She said the alleged sexual assault accusations are fabricated by the Democratic Party to worsen public opinion of Trump. However, Henry said she was offended by the comments in the “Access Hollywood” clip. But she said the comments came out 11 years ago, and since then Trump has become a better person.“I believe people can change,” Henry said. “Everybody makes mistakes. We’re human.”Since the release of the tape of Donald Trump making lewd comments and bragging about sexual assault, Trump has lost support across the board and particularly among women.Forty percent of women are less likely to support Trump after viewing the hot-mic tape, and 16 percent of Republican women are less likely to support him after the release of the tape, according to an ABC News and Washington Post poll.Henry said Trump’s mistakes from decades ago will come up because he is in the spotlight, but her own will not because she is not a public figure. Trump deserves the same treatment as any other person because in 2005 when he made the comments he did not know that he would be running for political office one day, she said.Henry said Trump is not perfect. However, she added Hillary Clinton is by far worse because she is not trustworthy. She said Trump’s status as an outsider and his business experience is what the United States needs right now.“The country needs a fresh start,” Henry said.Bloomington resident Glen Sparks said Trump has no tact, but still has his vote.Andrea Sparks, a Bloomington resident, said at the end of the day the country is in an economic slump, and Trump is the man to fix it. Nevertheless, she said she is nervous Trump will make mistakes when it comes to the military and foreign policy, in particular.Trump may get too aggressive with the United States’ enemies and get the country into another war, Andrea said.Sara Skrabalak, a Bloomington resident with signs for Clinton, governor candidate John Gregg and other Democratic Party candidates in her yard, said she was not surprised by Trump’s comments in the “Access Hollywood” clip based on the previous discriminatory comments he had made. However, as a woman and a Democrat, she said she is frustrated.Trump is not concerned about people, Skrabalak said. Americans are economically hurting, and Trump’s rise to power reflects the extent of economic hurt.Americans are looking a candidate who speaks to their concerns and frustrations, Skrabalak said. She said she hopes their frustrations can be channeled through more constructive political dialogue because she does not want her country to have a president who brags about sexual assault.Trump’s language and people’s dismissal of the comments are hurting people, she said.“I hope people might take a moment to pause and think about people who are victims of sexual assault,” Skrabalak said.As a woman, Andrea said she is not pleased with his comments. However, she is unsure if the sexual assault claims are true. The Democratic Party may have paid these women to say Trump assaulted them, she said.Andrea said though she thinks Trump is a loud mouth, she will still vote for him because Clinton is a hypocrite who is not truly for women.Andrea said if her husband did what Bill Clinton did to his wife, she would not keep him around. She said she does not like that Bill is involved in the campaign and continues to support his wife.“I won’t vote for her,” Andrea said. “That’s for darn sure. I don’t respect her.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Indiana Daily Student’s investigations team has been reporting on campus sexual assault and how IU handles alleged harassment, assault and rape cases this semester. It’s difficult work, but last week was particularly jarring.The release of tapes of Donald Trump speaking lewdly about his actions with women illuminated a nationwide fragmentation between people who defend so-called locker-room talk and those who vilify it.After one woman tweeted her first experience of assault at age 12 with the hashtag #notokay, thousands followed and contributed to an internet phenomenon: a communal unburdening. People came forward because others had. Some discussed their assaults for the very first time.Reading through the tweets reminded the IDS that sexual violence is objectively not OK, and though we are journalists, we are students, too. Our own experiences are part of the very framework of rape culture on which we’ve been reporting on.In the hour before the second presidential debate, we tweeted our own stories in hopes of encouraging others to share theirs. I prepared for an empty inbox. Instead the emails, texts and phone calls flooded in. It’s been one week, and we’ve had more than 20 responses. Most came from current or former IU students. Many stories happened on a college campus.We’ve been humbled by your trust and amazed at the totality and ubiquity of the experiences. To say your bravery has better informed our understanding of the issue would be an understatement. We hope that by sharing a few of your stories in our paper today and descriptions of our ongoing investigations stories, you too will have a greater understanding of sexual violence, and perhaps you will consider coming forward with your story.Hannah Alani, investigations editorinvestigations@idsnews.comI told him no. He held me down and came inside me. I told him no.***I took a very drunk friend home so he wouldn’t drive. While in his house, he kisses me, and I told him I needed to go.As I turned the corner, he slammed me up against the wall, stuck his hand up my dress and grabbed my crotch. The look in his eyes was cold and evil. He did not see me as a person at all.***In my young adulthood, I met a handsome and successful professional. He was 10 years older, and I was very naïve. He and I drank some wine, and we started to become intimate.I consented to vaginal intercourse but not anal. He did it anyway and told me to just relax. Then he quickly took a shower and kicked me out of his apartment.I was too intoxicated to drive, but did it anyway. I was in shock over what had just happened. I was scared to go to the police because I was tipsy, and I had consented to some sex. I knew it would not be a case that I would win. For days I bled, trying to rationalize and make myself believe it did not happen. It happened though.***Went in bed to “cuddle,” he did more than cuddle with me even when I said no.***I had separated and filed for divorce. I had a restraining order against my estranged husband. He kept showing up at my job. I would call the police, and he would leave before they arrived.One night he showed up at my job when I was alone. He forced me into a back room and raped – it’s hard to even type that word – me. I called the police after he left. A few weeks later they arrested him.When I went to do a deposition, his attorney started by naming every boyfriend that I had ever had and insinuating that somehow I deserved it.***I told him that I was pushing him away. He started getting angry and told me I needed to live in the moment, that I “didn’t have to do anything,” I just had to “lay down.”He continued to force his hands in my pants and under my shirt. In the morning, he texted me “my b.”***I was sexually assaulted as an IU grad student, but not on the IU campus ... When I returned to Indiana, I sought an STI test from the Health Center about two weeks after I was subjected to my assailant’s unprotected penis and bodily fluids.After the physician examined my genitals and took specimens to put in vials, I had to walk to the Health Center’s lab from my exam room with a clear plastic bag of my bodily fluids. I would have really appreciated a paper bag to avoid the weird looks I had to ignore while walking through the busy health center.***One thing led to another and started kissing, which I was OK with it. He kept moving on and trying to do more. I repeatedly asked him to stop.He then pulled down my pants, pull down his pants, put one hand on my throat and one hand over my mouth and proceeded to rape me ... I kept trying to get away and it wasn’t until my dog jumped up on the bed and peed on him was I able to escape.***My sophomore year of college, I went on a date with a guy. I did everything right, I thought ... all public places ... dinner, a movie, and then a trip to a library to talk. He raped me in a conference room of the library.He said I “owed” him because he bought me dinner, and I led him on because I kissed him.',\n",

       "  'body': '“Mandrake, do you recall what Clemenceau once said about war?” Gen. Jack D. Ripper asks in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove.“He said war was too important to be left to the generals. When he said that, 50 years ago, he might have been right. But today, war is too important to be left to politicians. They have neither the time, the training nor the inclination for strategic thought. I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination, Communist subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.”I can imagine Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the supreme allied commander of NATO, or even Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton, saying Ripper’s word’s to a similar effect. But today, NATO has troops stationed deep into what once made up the Soviet Union’s Iron Curtain — all the way up to Russia’s border with Latvia and Estonia.Clinton now speaks of Russian “infiltration” and “subversion” of her now-likely coronation as president of the United States.On Saturday, the Obama administration announced it would be directing the CIA to carry out a cyber-attack against Russia as retribution for unsubstantiated claims that Russia has hacked Democratic Party officials and provided the documents to WikiLeaks.Even if the “covert” attack is nothing more than fear mongering to boost Clinton’s candidacy, President Obama is barreling toward a confrontation with Russia that Clinton is eager to inherit.In the fallout from Donald Trump’s sexual assault fiascoes, I genuinely considered breaking my abstaining mentality and voting for Clinton.Then, I witnessed her comments about Russia at the second presidential debate. She again advocated for a no-fly zone, which would require a large amount of U.S. troops to enforce and allow for Russian planes to be shot out of the sky.Furthermore, in Clinton’s own leaked high-profile speeches to the wealthy, she admitted that a no-fly zone would “kill a lot of Syrians.” Those that call for a “war crimes” investigation into Russia for its bombing of East Aleppo are either purposefully encouraging war or too much of a brainwashed patriot to believe that the U.S. should be held accountable for its crimes.The mainstream press is in full support of the impending bombing of the ISIS-held city of Mosul, Iraq, which the Guardian admits is inhabited by “hundreds of thousands of civilians” that are “digging makeshift bomb shelters” and “stockpiling food.”If you’re under attack from American bombs, it’s just another day at the office, but if they’re Russian bombs, it’s a “Holocaust.” I worry about Clinton’s commitment to antagonizing an economically weak nuclear power that has been geographically backed into a corner.I also see a mainstream press intent on selling the war just as they always have.In the western echo chamber, any criticism of U.S. policy toward Russia is subversion directed by the Kremlin. That is why the attempts to delegitimize WikiLeaks’ release of Clinton documents is so dangerous. Consider Clinton’s blasé comments about regime change in Syria in a leaked transcript of one of her Goldman Sachs speeches: “My view was you intervene as covertly as is possible for Americans to intervene.“We used to be much better at this than we are now.“Now, you know, everybody can’t help themselves. They have to go out and tell their friendly reporters.”As a journalist, I await the mayhem that will be released by Clinton’s presidency with chagrin but will still keep my spine unlike other writers in this country who fail to recognize that Clinton’s love of imperialism is a threat to us all.luwrobin@umail.iu.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Dozens of members of Students Against State Violence and Students for a Democratic Society rallied Saturday afternoon, passing out fliers, speaking and chalking to raise awareness of SASV’s three major demands.They demand the University redirect funding for the IU Police Department and Police Academy toward resources for minority students and faculty, restructure the Office of Student Ethics to be autonomous from the administration, and rework general education requirements to promote diversity and social justice education.As the clock tower struck 2 p.m., they unrolled three banners. The first was yellow, placed directly between the Sample Gates. It read, “IU profits from rape culture.”The banners occupying the left and right walkways read “Black Lives Matter” and “New Campus Now.”Even with the banner backdrop, families with toddlers, alumni from decades past and groups of girls in candy-striped overalls continued to wrap their arms around each other and smile for homecoming photos.Sophomore SDS representative Stanley Njuguna said he hopes passersby were reminded that SASV’s demands are important and don’t disappear simply because IU football happens to be playing.“Folks are free to drink and partake in the fanfare,” he said. “But they will not be absolved from facing the issues that are affecting people every day in the community.”Senior Jess Mann of SASV, said the group chose homecoming for the rally because many IU donors would be in town and deserve to know what’s happening on campus.Some listened. Some did not.“It’s sort of disheartening that we’re trying to say, ‘Here, look at this information,’ and people don’t even want to look at it,” senior Claudia Brooks said as her freshman sister, Jordan, extended a flier toward a man who ignored her. “It’s not a lot of words on here.”Their sheets outlined how the former director of student ethics faced allegations of sexual assault last semester and how SASV believes IU should have investigated his case more thoroughly.Neither of the Brooks sisters had heard about the case before recently becoming involved with SASV, but they had been raised with convictions in social justice issues.“I would feel really accomplished if the University just acknowledged what we wanted and listened to the dialogue,” Jordan said.“Yeah, I’d like to get people in general to see there’s a problem,” Claudia said. “I feel like, as a student of the University, wouldn’t you want to know this?”Just a few yards away from the sisters, Associate Dean of Students Carol McCord spoke with a couple SASV members.She said she understands the group’s concerns but worries they’re painting with too broad of a stroke. Past problems in staffing, she said, do not mean the current administration is not trained and invested in student well-being.In addition, she feared the yellow banner could frighten victims of sexual assault and discourage them from seeking help from the University, which offers avenues of support outside of the Office of Student Ethics.She said those in need can reach out to Sexual Assault Crisis Services, a division of Counseling and Psychological Services, and Confidential Victim Advocates, a segment of the Student Advocates Office.According to McCord, assessing methods of raising awareness of sexual assault is essential to affecting change.“We all need to work at this,” McCord said. “The way you do this can make a difference in the life of a real person right now.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Omega Phi Beta was one of many clubs and individuals gathered to advocate for survivors of sexual and domestic abuse at Take Back the Night.Take Back the Night is a yearly event planned by the IU Feminist Student Association in cooperation with organizations related to sexual abuse. It features a poetry reading as well as a march to the Monroe County Courthouse, culminating in an opportunity to speak out for sexual assault and domestic violence survivors.The event has taken place for around 10 years. This is the fourth year the Feminist Student Association’s president, Carmen Vernon, has attended it, she said.Vernon said a key message this year and in years prior is healing for victims through storytelling.Two IU students and a professor recited poems about their experiences with sexual and domestic abuse. Evelyn Smith of Middle Way House, a shelter for domestic abuse victims and rape crisis center, also spoke.One attendee, Ryleigh Beatty, came because she was interested in the cause, but also to support her friends who have been affected by sexual abuse.“IU really needs to step up their game,” Beatty said. “They need to own it and realize it’s a problem.”One campus group that seeks to improve sexual education on campus is Raising Awareness of Interactions in Sexual Encounters. The group works with many different groups on campus, including fraternities, sororities and classes, to lead discussions and teach about sexual situations.Karis Neufeld is a RAISE member who represented the organization at Take Back the Night.She said some of her work the prior year included going to fraternities during pledge week and facilitating conversations on communication and sexual assault.Neufeld said Take Back the Night is a great way for organizations like RAISE to not only educate people about their work, but also network with other clubs that support survivors.“It’s another way to find like-minded people and connect other organizations,” Newfeld said.From Vernon’s perspective, too, the night was about providing strong support for survivors.“It’s more common than they think it is,” Vernon said about what she hopes people take away from Take Back the Night. “It’s happening to someone they know, and that person may not have told them. It’s a very personal topic. People keep it bottled up. You should always be asking questions and being more proactive.”Shortly after the speeches, attendees took part in a silent march down Kirkwood Avenue to the courthouse.Vernon said the purpose behind the silence was to emphasize the healing aspect of the march. She said it takes place to show the support network available for sexual abuse survivors, not to demand anything.The band of people from Dunn Meadow walked down Indiana Avenue as the sun set, then turned down Kirkwood Avenue, stopping traffic so the large group could cross.At the end of the line, two Omega Phi Beta members trailed, survivor’s suitcase in hand, depicting the burden survivors continue to face.“We shouldn’t be scared to walk in darkness,” Vernon said. “We shouldn’t be scared for our safety when we walk at night.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Rain may have interrupted Sigma Chi’s second annual Hoosiers Against Sexual Assault event Wednesday evening, but it didn’t discourage members from participating. Instead they moved inside the house to hear speeches about sexual assault prevention and bystander intervention techniques.Cullen Hoene, a junior and member of Sigma Chi fraternity, started the event when he realized sexual assault was prevalent on campus and wanted to do something about it.“I saw people doing great events for things like cancer research but didn’t really see anything that was affecting our campus right here and right now,” Hoene said.Hoene said he hopes the event will positively effect Sigma Chi and the greek community by raising awareness and making discussions about sexual assault less taboo.“We want members to be able to have constructive discussions about it with their friends and families,” Hoene said.Speaking at the event was Leslie Fasone, assistant dean of students of women’s and gender affairs, who emphasized the importance of not accepting nonverbal communication as consent, especially in situations where two people don’t know each other well. Stalking and sexual exploitation, like sharing of explicit text messages, are other issues Fasone said are present on college campuses.“What we really need to do is educate students on what they can do to step up and intervene in certain situations,” Fasone said.Fasone also encouraged Sigma Chi members to show support to friends who come to them about sexual assault experiences.“Believe them,” Fasone said. “Listen. Show them that you care and support them,”Emily Milner, a donor relations manager at Middle Way House, spoke at the event to inform attendees about Middle Way House’s different services, including the men’s engagement program which encourages more men to volunteer.Milner said greek organizations have been good about responding to her requests for communication about sexual assault, but they should try to be more proactive about preventing it rather than only discussing it after the fact.“I think there have been some good steps forward, but we still have a lot left to go,” Milner said.Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller spoke to inform attendees about the Indiana Coalition to End Sexual Assault. He said the coalition is determined to treat victims with dignity and respect.Zoeller commended Sigma Chi for having discussions about sexual assault issues and said the audiences he speaks to about sexual assault are usually made up of women.“In order to have a discussion about sexual assault we should be talking to men, too,” Zoeller said.Josh Leitman, co-director of Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault, encouraged fraternity men to watch out for other people and be aware of their surroundings at social events.Leitman used coercion as an example of a sexual assault issue that can happen at parties and other social events, and he said members should intervene in situations where they think someone is being pressured into doing something.“The culture is to leave it alone and not go against the grain, but it’s important to go against the grain,” Leitman said.',\n",

       "  'body': '“I have the best words.”Throughout the entirety of his campaign, Donald Trump has bragged that he has the best of everything: advisers, policies, know-how and, apparently, words.Cue our collective confusion, then, when, during the last presidential debate, he informed us that the 2005 recording of him boasting about using his celebrity status to sexually assault women is “just words, folks.”Here’s a direct quote from the recording, in case you haven’t heard yet: “I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\"But back to the main point here. This discrepancy leaves us with two different options: we must either take all of his words to be true or none of them at all.Both leave us with a rather stark outlook for Trump.If the first, well, that’s not good. It means that he is a rapist, a birther, an anti-vaxxer, a racist and a misogynist — in other words, everything that we should aspire not to be.If the second, well, that’s not good, either. It means that Trump, a major party candidate for president of the United States, cannot be taken at his word — any of them, in fact.Like I said, both are troubling. Frightening. Horrible. Enough to make me want to lock myself in my room and stress-eat nothing but pints of Ben & Jerry’s Half Baked ice cream until the morning of Nov. 9.When preparing to write my column this week, I almost wrote about something else. Several other IDS columnists had already written about this latest scandal in Trump’s scandal-ridden campaign, and I didn’t want to beat a dead horse.But the election is less than a month away, and as easy as it would be to metaphorically lock myself in a Trump-less state of mind, bingeing on cartons of calorie-laden ice cream, I simply cannot do that. I can’t.We cannot allow this to go the way of nearly every other narrative in the news cycle — that is, circulate for a few days, then make an appearance every once in a while as a talking point.No, this revelation needs to be a watershed moment in the 2016 election. It needs to define the remainder of the election.We owe it to our country and ourselves to ensure that no one forgets this, but most of all, we owe it to the future generations of our country. Trump’s America is entirely unrecognizable to me: it is hateful and divisive, cruel and untrusting. It sees the worst in nearly everybody.But Trump’s America is not yet our America. We can prevent it from becoming a reality by refusing to elect him on Nov. 8.Now is the moment for us to define our country’s beliefs, values, and hopes for the future. Or, if you want to put it in the terms of “Les Misérables,” “It is time for us all to decide who we are.”Who we are is nowhere near what Trump says we are. And that’s not “just words” — that’s a fact.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Another week, another crime that I did not receive an official crime alert for.The first words out of my mouth are typically, “Where is the IU crime alert?”I would like to clarify that I understand why we do not receive a crime alert for every crime that happens in Bloomington.Not all crime takes place on campus, and IU Notify focuses on campus-specific incidents, as the concentrated student population lives on campus.However, when the crimes involve sexual assaults, break-ins or robberies that affect students, we should be receiving alerts.During my freshman and sophomore years, I remember receiving many crime alerts ranging from silly incidents like the Blow Dart Bandit to missing students. This is not quite the case this school year.During Welcome Week, we received an alert for an attempted robbery at the Village Pantry, but I can’t recall many other crime alerts since then, despite the high crime activity so far this year.For example, a masked man broke into female students’ apartments in a general area and robbed them and/or raped them — for which we received no alerts.Just because some of these incidents are not happening on campus, it does not mean that they are no longer affecting students.Students come and go from campus every day and travel through areas of heavy crime, but they may not know if there are ongoing incidents because of the lack of notifications.The IU and Bloomington Police Departments are not conjoined, which I realize. I also realize that people report different crimes to different police departments.Whoever runs the notification system should communicate with both of the departments to see if anything has been reported that affects students.Of course, before I came to rant and rave about my feelings about lack of notifications, I looked into other channels that report crime and emergency situations in Bloomington.I discovered that IU has at least two websites that report criminal activities and other emergencies around campus and the immediate area.IUPD has a daily crime log that is posted every day on http://www.indiana.edu/~iupd/dailyLog.html. Here, you can find criminal activity around campus that occurred in the dorms or other campus buildings. The logs protect privacy of those involved. They only give the time of the crime, location and type of crime.The other website I discovered revolves around emergency situations, online safety, and environmental safety. The webpage is called “Protect IU.” There, you can report an offense, check registered sexual offenders and check the emergency status of IU.I learned that IU Notify and Crime Alert stem from the “Protect IU” webpage.It’s important to me and many other students that we are notified about terrible crimes on campus, especially sexual assaults.For some reason, sexual assaults are becoming more and more common. It’s impossible to assume every sexual assault will be reported. The stigma surrounding reporting sexual assault gets me heated enough to write a whole other column, but not this week.IU should report any and all situations it is aware of. The grisly details do not need to be known. We don’t need to know the names of the assailant or the assaulted.But I will never forget the fear in my best friend’s eyes when she learned there had been a sexual assault in her dorm and she was not notified.Nor will I forget the feeling of knowing assaults have been happening on or around campus and IU has not done a single thing to alert us.',\n",

       "  'body': 'I don’t believe that anything I can say that has not been said about Donald Trump’s video.I don’t think that there is a way to say how angry I was.Some of my anger is related to all of the politicians that denounced the Republican nominee. Great, they denounced him, and I think that it should have occurred a lot sooner, but one thing that I took away from this is that my worth is apparently tied to how I relate to the men in my life.Almost every politician mentioned they have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter or any female relative in the book that should be “revered and cherished.” While I appreciate the sentiment, I don’t think having a relation to a man should be necessary for people to finally denounce a statement that is so overtly sexually aggressive.First, I want to clarify that sexual assault is not a women’s issue.While women are more likely to be sexually assaulted, men are affected by sexual assault and oftentimes are more likely to not report their actions due to shame.When any politician, speechwriter, person says that they cannot accept sexual assault because of their female relationships, what are they saying about male relationships? What about having sons? Or what about just knowing that people undergo sexual assault?Most of my friends have had a personal story about sexual harassment or sexual assault. That includes both men and women.By solely mentioning sexual assault as it relates to female relatives, we are diminishing all of the the stories of silent survivors, whether male or female.While my concern for all survivors is one of my major problems with the response to Trump’s comments, that’s not even my biggest problem.It’s the fact that he consistently talks about women in relation to men.I am fine being called my parent’s daughter or my brother’s sister, or even someone’s girlfriend. However, I only want to be referred to in that way a few times. I am more than all of those labels.I am a student, a hiker, a runner, an avid book reader and a columnist.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Following the denouncements from 21 representatives, 6 governors, 14 senators and a former Secretary of State all within his own party, Donald Trump is currently leading the Republican ticket in the presidential election with a lack of party support.Monday morning following the second presidential debate, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan told Republican Party lawmakers he will no longer defend Trump as president and solely focus on defending the party’s majority.Although this does not officially take away Ryan’s endorsement of his party’s nominee, the lack of support has spread throughout the country, including Bloomington and Monroe County as a whole.The compromise for many GOP officials is not publicly endorsing Trump for the position, but rather supporting the party as a whole.“I endorse everyone on the Republican side because they have earned the spot to represent our party,” William Ellis, Chairman of the Monroe County Republican Party, said.Ellis said everyone is entitled to their opinion in reference to the many Republican leaders that denounced Trump, yet the support for the individual should not overpower the support of the power.“Now that we have a nominee it is our duty to get them elected,” Ellis said. “This is not a race between Hillary Clinton and Trump. It’s a race for the Supreme Court for the next 30 years and that needs to be the party’s focus.”Ellis said Trump was the lesser of two evils between the two candidates, referencing his success in the second debate and Clinton’s lack of responses to her crime allegations.“I think that with all the important issues that there are, and with where Donald Trump stands on these issues should be the focus,” John Arnold, Monroe County Republican Party treasurer, said.Arnold identified as an undecided voter, and said he was trying to take all of the information in at once to reach a decision on election day.Ellis said when the Democrats are posed with a direct question, they tend to ignore it and no one addresses the issue.It’s extremely telling that Hillary did not address the reasoning behind her mistakes, Ellis said.Many of the Republican officials denounced their endorsements following the leak of the 2005 tape of Entertainment Tonight in which Trump referenced sexually assaulting women.“I will say my criticism on how he addressed the problem, especially when addressing it as ‘locker room talk,’” Ellis said. “I don’t think that kind of talk should be allowed in any context.”Even with this criticism, Ellis said he would endorse any Republican in a sense.“We need to raise the level of the conversation to the important issues that we are facing including immigration reform and the growing deficit,” Arnold said.Arnold said he wanted the focus to leave the personal lives of the candidates and solely be on the nation’s issues. His support relied on the stances on these issues.“For both parties, when you are a party officer, you are supposed to support your ticket,” Ellis said. “When I took office, I knew this was my duty.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Student Advocates Office, located in Eigenmann Hall, helps any IU student encountering an issue or concern that impacts their life as a student by connecting them to resources on campus.The office is made up of seven paid professionals and 19 volunteers, who are retired IU staff members. These 26 people make up three teams, which are the academic and administrative team, which can help with problems involving roommates, instructors or grades; the judicial team, which helps students going through the conduct system; and the confidential victim team, which helps students who have experienced stalking, sexual violence, dating violence or harassment.The Student Advocates Office can help with students’ financial concerns and connect them to the Office of Financial Literacy, which specializes in financial planning through programs such as IU MoneySmarts.“I can’t speak highly enough about them,” said Mindy Metzcar, assistant director of the office.Any student who wants to withdraw from all classes has to go through the Student Advocates Office. It will help the student understand what it means, how they will be affected and what they need to consider.They also help with opening the door to a conversation with a professor after missing class due to a big life event. They can help with a grade appeal or grade change request when the student feels the grade was calculated with an error or by discrimination.In cases of sexual assault, the office can help by writing letters to professors for academic support, working with the students for their safety and protection, and providing people for students to talk to. They can also connect students to resources such as Sexual Assault Crisis Services, which is completely free.Sally Thomas, senior assistant director of the Student Advocates Office, stressed she is one of very few confidential staff members on campus.“Come to me, I’m confidential,” Thomas said. “I can talk about your options.”Before or after receiving a misconduct letter, students can go into this office and get help with understanding the charge and their responsibilities. It is also a safe place for students to tell their side of the story. The office will also help students prepare for appeals and accompany them to meetings if need be.The Student Advocates Office is connected to multiple Welcome Week activities in an effort to portray itself as a friendly place to go when students need help. They always have someone manning the phone or sitting in the office, ready to help.The idea behind the Student Advocates Office is that the volunteers are dedicated to their work, and they all have knowledge of how the university works, as they all previously worked for IU.“We are that office that, if you call, we are going to pick up the phone,” Thomas said.A previous version of this story referred to the Office of Financial Literacy as the Money Smarts Office.

       "  'body': 'Sitting down to write this column, I was at a complete and utter loss for words.I could think of nothing to say after the weekend’s events. The Washington Post published an audio recording of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump bragging to television personality Billy Bush about trying to have sex with a married woman and promoting sexual assault.“When you’re a star, they let you do anything. Grab them by their pussy,” he said.It’s not Trump’s comments alone that upset me. That doesn’t mean they’re any less horrible. They’re just unsurprising.What makes me upset, disappointed, infuriated and ashamed are my friends, family, former teachers and peers and their comfortability defending Trump’s comments.Their eagerness to extend Trump their grace and mercy for these unforgivable words and not do the same to the Clintons is deafeningly hypocritical.They believe these phrases — “locker-room talk” or “guy talk” — are acceptable, and it’s as disappointing to learn that’s the quality of the men they associate with as it is insulting to realize they assume all men are that way.I never want to hear the conservatives who have defended Trump to say a word about chivalry again.You cannot ask us to be respectful of women in public while sexually assaulting them in private and then laughing about it. You must choose one, and your inability to condemn Trump has made your choice maddeningly clear.I found myself at a loss to write this column because my job as an opinion columnist is to be persuasive, but I never imagined having to persuade people not to elect to the presidency a man who brags about sexual assault.After reading the comments from a variety of conservatives online and briefly engaging in conversation with them, it’s apparent that there will be no persuading them — at least not by someone on the far left. I must ask, then, that you listen to your party. Republican leadership has abandoned Trump.Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, withdrew his support. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, have asked Trump to step aside and let Gov. Mike Pence lead the ticket.Pence criticized Trump and canceled an appearance at a campaign event scheduled for Sunday.Down-ballot Republicans in tight Senate races, like Joe Heck and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hamsphire, are rushing to condemn him.Conservatives, your ship is sinking.I’m not asking you to jump. I’m simply asking you to go down with dignity and class so you may be able to say, “I didn’t vote for a rapist.”For the Christians among you who say, “He’s not a rapist. Saying it and doing it aren’t the same thing,” let me remind you of the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus assures us they are.For the secularists among you, let me be clear. I would never suggest arresting or otherwise legally punishing Trump for his words because I believe in the First Amendment. But the qualifications for president should be higher than the standard he has set.I implore you not to participate in electing a man who promotes sexual assault. I beg of you to show us the Republican Party can be — and is — better than Donald J. Trump.thshowal@indiana.edu@TherinShowalter',\n",

       "  'body': 'The second presidential debate touched on the issues that undecided voters were most passionate about approaching the Nov. 8 election. Of these issues, these are some of the ones the candidates focused on the most.What are appropriate and positive behaviors for today’s youthHillary Clinton said we are going to respect one another and lift each other up, and we are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity. She wanted to have an optimistic view of the country, celebrating diversity above all. Trump said he agreed with everything Clinton said, yet the country is currently in a bad place when it comes to business and trade. He also said his leaked 2005 video was just “locker-room talk” and the threat of ISIS was more important.William Ellis, chairman of the Monroe County Republican Party, said Trump’s commentary and behavior in the leaked 2005 video is deplorable.“People say that’s how men talk, and maybe I’m the exception to the rule, but I don’t even talk to my wife in private like that,” Ellis said.Mark Fraley, chair of the Democratic Party of Monroe County, said these comments are part of Trump’s continuing pattern.“He has long shown himself to believe that women are less than human beings and exist as playthings for people like himself,” Fraley said.He said Bloomington residents know the pain of sexual assault all too well. This is the kind of behavior the country is trying to get rid of, Fraley said; however, people in power like Trump are perpetuating rape culture.Affordable Care ActTrump said Obamacare is a disaster. “You know it. We all know it,” Trump said. “Obamacare will never work. It’s very bad. Very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.” Clinton had conflicting ideas. She wanted to address the needed cost cuts versus getting rid of the healthcare system all together. “I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act, but we’ve got to get costs down,” Clinton said.Ellis said Trump nailed taxation in the debate; however, he would like to see more discussion on insurance and state barriers.Fraley said he was displeased Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act because it will bring the country back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions.He said he believes Clinton’s plan to adjust Obamacare is much more sensible and will benefit lower- and middle-class Americans.TaxesTrump’s not releasing his tax returns came up as a major issue in the debate. Clinton said Trump is living in an alternative reality when it comes to taxes and he only plans to give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts.Trump said he understood the tax code better than anybody that’s run for president. He said he pays income taxes and federal taxes and Clinton’s bad judgement will not help the tax situation.Fraley said Trump wants to sell the Bush and Reagan idea of giving tax cuts to the wealthy as something that’s going to benefit Americans. However, Fraley said the country “has enough experience to know that’s bogus.” Taxation is a complex situation that requires someone with good judgment and discipline to do the job.“That’s clearly Hillary Clinton,” Fraley said.Ellis said he was unhappy with both candidates’ plans. He said he would like to see a robust discussion on the fair tax, but the country is not there yet. Clinton discussed investing in people; however, Ellis is concerned that this will increase taxes for Americans across the board.Syria and Aleppo crisisClinton said she would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than the United States currently has with dealing with foreign powers and she is running a campaign on the issues versus insults. Trump asked the audience “how stupid is our country,” referencing bringing in potential murderers into the country, if more and more refugees were permitted. Islamophobia was looked at as the responsibility of the Muslims that enter the country to report on what they see by Trump. Clinton saw it as a major issue of the country that needs to be approached, focusing on the religious freedom of the country.“We have to cut off the head of ISIS,” Ellis said. “The United States needs to wage war to win and do everything it can to minimize civilian casualties. However, this should not be done at the expense of dragging the war out because that will lead to a greater loss of life.”“Trump understands that in war you wage it to win and do it as quickly as possible,” Ellis said.Fraley said he did not understand Trump’s plan other than that it is the “best plan in the world.” Syria is a difficult situation that requires a president with good judgment and discipline to do the job.“That’s clearly Hillary Clinton,” Fraley said.On Islamophobia, Fraley said Trump did not present a coherent idea. On the other hand, Clinton spoke about celebrating diversity, which is what the U.S. was built on.“This is a country whose history is hung on a timeline of being more expansive to people,” Fraley said. “That is what Hillary is trying to get back to.”Ellis said he agrees with Trump and the nation needs to come to the realization that most terrorist attacks are committed by radical Muslims.“We have to confront terrorism and call it what it is,” he said. “Nevertheless, Americans of middle-eastern background deserve the same rights as everyone else in the country.”Alyson Malinger and Melanie Metzman',\n",

       "  'body': \"Many of the following issues are on the forefront of college students’ minds. While the candidates address some of these issues on their websites and in their platforms, only some of them were adressed in front of the nation during the debate. This list is comprised of issues discussed in articles featured in The Atlantic.Sexual assault on campusOn Friday, The Washington Post leaked audio of a 2005 conversation in which Trump discussed sexual advances he made on women. The audio included Trump using language such as “grab her by the pussy” and “when you’re a star, they let you do it.”A poster detailing what consent is and how to get help if you have been sexually assaulted can be found on almost every bathroom stall door at IU. On the forefront of many college students minds is the prevalence of this type of violence on campus. Clinton specifically details on her website her plan to end assault, which includes offering support to survivors, creating a fair process to report and prosecute these crimes and increasing prevention efforts. Trump does not talk about campus assault on his site.Neither candidate specifically mentioned sexual assault on college campuses during the debate. Trump denied that what he said in a 2005 video qualified as sexual assault, claiming his “locker-room talk” is just “one of those things” and is unimportant in the grand scheme of the election. He then redirected his response to ISIS, an issue he said was much more topical. He also brought up Bill Clinton's history of sexual assault allegations, saying no one in U.S. political history was as abusive toward women. Before the debate, he appeared with three women who accused Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior and one woman whose alleged abuser was acquitted with Hillary as his lawyer.For her part, Clinton referenced many points where Trump demeaned or objectified women in an attempt to counter the way he dismisses sexual assault. “Yes, this is who Donald Trump is,” Clinton said.College affordabilityWhen many students look at their Bursar bill, the sight of all the zeros following the price of tuition can be cringe worthy. This sentiment is echoed across the county as many millennials are struggling to grapple with the thousands of dollars of debt they will have as they graduate college. During Senator Bernie Sanders’ primary run, he made a big case for free tuition and a debt free college experience, but the current candidates stand a little differently. According to her website, Clinton’s plans include debt free college for students of certain incomes and free community college. According to his website, Trump proposes making trade school and two-year or four-year colleges “easier to access, pay for and finish.”Clinton mentioned keeping college affordable after the first Town Hall question about setting a good example for America’s children. She did not discuss the point further, and Trump never mentioned the issue.LGBT IssuesAround campus, there is a wide range of groups and services, including sororities and fraternities, offered specifically for LGBT students and allies who want to get involved with LGBT issues. Especially in the wake of the Orlando Pulse Nightclub shooting, LGBT activism has become more prominent. Clinton hits a number of issues in her website, including passing legislation for full equality of LGBT people and ensuring transgender rights. Trump does not explicitly address LGBT issues on his online platform.LGBT issues were not mentioned during the debate.EnvironmentOn his website, Trump said he plans to “conserve our natural habitats, reserves and resources” and “unleash America’s $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves.” Clinton, on the other hand, said on her website that in 10 years within the time she takes office, she plans to install half a billion solar panels by the end of her first term, cut American energy waste by a third and reduce oil consumption by a third.During the debate, Clinton said she wants to bring the coal industry back, but her campaign will also focus on protecting the environment. “I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses,” Clinton said.Trump said he appreciates alternative forms of energy, but wants to use natural gas and coal to focus on putting the energy industry before the environment. “We are killing, absolutely killing, the energy business in this country,” Trump said.Marijuana legalizationMarijuana, while illegal in Indiana and most other states, has a prominent place in college communities. Especially for millennials, the push for legalization has been amplified in recent years by states that have already legalized recreational use of the substance, like Oregon and Colorado. Neither candidates specifically addresses this issue on their website platforms.Marijuana legalization was not mentioned during the debate.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'The Comedy Attic is hosting three shows Saturday for its annual charity event. This year, the proceeds will go to Middle Way House to support victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault.Academy Award nominee Jesse Eisenberg, Diane Neal and Todd Barry will perform stand-up comedy at the event. The three comedians will be signing autographs, and autographed items from Eisenberg’s films will be auctioned off.“It’s vital people know about and support the emergency shelter, rape crisis and domestic violence victim services,” Eisenberg said in an email. “The legal advocacy services Middle Way House provides to hundreds of victims of abuse and assault every year really increase access to justice and make the whole community safer.”Middle Way House Events and Communication Director Rachael Himsel said in a press release the nonprofit lost $174,000 this year in funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.Eisenberg, who donated $100,000 to Middle Way, has been volunteering since January to try to close the mortgage so that they can focus on funding their crucial direct services.The Comedy Attic started donating the proceeds from shows to nonprofits eight years ago, club owner Jared Thompson said. They have continued the tradition since.“At the end of the day, the only thing that really matters is we’re going to be able to present Middle Way House with a super substantial amount of money, which I’m really excited about,” Thompson said.He said the show is the realization of a dream for him and his wife. When they opened the club, they had trouble finding audiences, he said.Today, their efforts bring people together to raise thousands of dollars for local Bloomington charities.Eisenberg said he advocates for being an upstander. Middle Way hosts training sessions throughout the year to help people get involved.“I don’t know if students know how many of their peers have benefited from Middle Way services,” he said. “You know, they’re the ones who meet rape survivors at the hospital in the middle of the night. They’re the ones who answer the phone the minute someone calls, every single day of the year, at any hour, when someone’s having a flashback or feeling afraid.”Thompson has known Eisenberg and Anna Strout, another volunteer at Middle Way, for a while, he said. They have attended shows on multiple occasions, but this will be the first time that Eisenberg will be performing stand-up at the club.He said it is rare for the club to host someone of Eisenberg’s stature.“We really are sort of just letting Jesse do what he wants,” he said. “We’re kind of hoping for there to be some stuff that people will remember forever.”Eisenberg said nothing is more terrifying to him than stand-up comedy, but it’s a great way to reach a broad range of people and to get them to discuss uncomfortable issues.“I’ll take laughter, even if it’s at me, instead of with me,” Eisenberg said about his debut.',\n",

       "  'body': 'As last month’s Emmy Awards proved, HBO is dominating television this year.“Game of Thrones” is one of the biggest shows in the history of television, “The Night Of” wowed fans and critics alike, “Veep” is a smash hit and critical favorite “The Leftovers” will soon begin its third and final season.That said, the end is in sight for each of these shows, and HBO is counting on “Westworld,” its new expansive sci-fi drama, to pick up the slack. And based on Sunday’s intense, enthralling and occasionally disturbing premiere, that faith is well-founded.Based loosely on the 1973 film of the same name, “Westworld” introduces a futuristic theme park where guests pay absurd amounts of money to interact in a Western setting with synthetic life forms.It’s nearly impossible to tell early on who is a human and who is a machine, which “Westworld” uses to its advantage. Guests make their way through the park in a sort of real-life “choose your own adventure,” often choosing to murder, rape and act out their most horrific fantasies.One victim of these fantasies is the robot Dolores, played by Evan Rachel Wood, who repeats the same looped storyline every day unless interrupted by a guest.Even without the involvement of the often abusive “players,” Dolores’s loop is horrifying. She wakes up with a smile, goes about her daily errands, meets a dashing cowboy, played by James Marsden, and then returns home to see her family being brutally murdered by outlaws.This ugliness is inherent in almost every aspect of the park, thanks to Westworld employees and their chosen storylines.While some employees are more sympathetic to the “hosts” than others — one employee, played by Anthony Hopkins, seems to encourage humanity in his creations — many of Westworld’s creators seem even more unfeeling than the robots they construct.During the premiere, a glitch in some of the hosts’ programming causes a few of them to act out. This leads to recalls and investigations into many of the robots.Thanks to fantastic performances from much of the main cast and some subtle CGI manipulation, the “hosts” come across as simultaneously lifelike and not-quite-right. Wood, in particular, walks a perfect line between naively harmless and straight-up scary.The supporting cast is equally solid so far, despite being made up of an odd array of actors including Rodrigo Santoro (what has he been doing since “Love Actually”?) Thandie Newton, Jeffrey Wright and Luke Hemsworth (the elusive third Hemsworth brother).HBO also makes use of “Game of Thrones” composer Ramin Djawadi, whose music — think “Game of Thrones” theme meets “Downton Abbey” — accompanies a gorgeous, haunting credit sequence.Despite the many things that “Westworld” does right, it has one glitch of its own that is impossible to overlook.HBO has been under fire for years now concerning its unnecessarily violent treatment of women, and “Westworld” is possibly the worst perpetrator to date.The show uses the murder and rape of the hosts to illustrate larger points about the casual exploitation of fictional lives, but their treatment is distressing nonetheless.It may serve a larger purpose — which is hard to predict after seeing only the first episode — but for now, the assault and abuse of innocent creatures (even those who aren’t technically sentient) is genuinely hard to watch.Despite this, it’s the larger stakes at play that make “Westworld” so compelling.Beyond the basic layers of the story is the exploration of broader themes within the narrative. As guests brutalize their way through the park, it’s impossible to miss the reflection on today’s popular entertainment.We like our video games bloody, our movies sexy and our television shocking. But at what point do those choices begin to affect us as people? What happens when other people’s trauma becomes our entertainment?Some viewers will ironically enjoy “Westworld” because of the sex, violence and shock value.Others will look a bit deeper and love it for the symbolism and allegory. Shakespeare fans will enjoy one particular scene in the premiere.Many others will enjoy the show on some levels, while finding the casual violence and sexual mistreatment unsettling.Whichever category you fit into, one thing is for sure — “Westworld” may have a glitch in its programming, but its well worth saddling up for the ride.khalliwe@indiana.edu@kate__halliwell',\n",

       "  'body': 'Early Monday morning, five men falsely dressed as cops raided Kim Kardashian’s apartment in Paris, France, for Fashion Week.Before making off with supposedly about $10 million in jewelry, the men tied the celebrity’s hands with zip ties, taped her mouth and held her at gunpoint in her bathroom, threatening to kill her if she didn’t comply.What a year this has been.The five assailants were reported to have handcuffed, tied up, gagged and locked up a male concierge. Two of the five entered Kardashian’s room before assaulting the “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” star.Despite this, it appears very little of the internet actually cares about Monday’s incident, some going so far as to brush it off as a publicity stunt for the upcoming season of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians.”I will admit, this story doesn’t entirely add up. There were apparently no bodyguards present before the attack, most of the articles on the event have anonymous sources, and none of us know exactly how Kardashian freed herself from being tied up in the bathroom.Some are even speculating that Kardashian faked the whole thing in order to help pay off West’s $53 million debt. If that’s not crazy enough, there’s virtually no existing security footage of the incident.If this whole thing turns out to be a hoax, it could be very detrimental to Kardashian’s career. With that said, our lack of knowledge on the subject should be precisely why no concrete judgement should be made. That’s just a good sense of justice.Regardless of how you may feel about the rich or Kardashian herself, severe attacks such as this should never be met with mockery or hatefulness. You can’t expect help for the common person if you deny it to a more distinguished one.If you brush off this act of violence simply because of Kardashian’s wealth or fame, then you are, by default, minimalizing the significant number of similar attacks that happen to others every year. Fame is not a gateway to dehumanization, nor is it armor against hateful behavior.According to an ongoing report from Us magazine, Kardashian feared for her life during the raid, believing she would be sexually assaulted or killed. She was hysterically crying and begging for her life to the attackers, who apparently did not speak English.Kanye West cut off his concert in Queens, New York, as soon as he heard about the incident. West has proceeded to reschedule two of his tour dates in December because of the incident, according to a press release from Live Nation.Of course, the prospect of stealing from the rich goes even further back than Robin Hood, but such large-scale robberies from A-list Hollywood celebrities is a pretty new idea. In fact, Paris itself acts as a sort of kingdom for thievery and is home to a large number of professional pickpockets and robbers.Between August 2008 and October 2009, a group of teen thieves known as the Bling Ring robbed the homes of countless celebrities, including Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Orlando Bloom and Megan Fox.The group is estimated to have stolen roughly three million dollars in cash and belongings. However, the Bling Ring has gone on to acquire great notoriety, even inspiring two films based on their exploits.So, obviously, Kardashian’s robbers weren’t the first to carry out an armed mission against the wealth of celebrities.But, of course, Twitter has been making plenty of judgements on the matter, aside from just the doubts. Many tweeters have been arguing if Kardashian didn’t “flaunt her wealth” so often, then her robbery would have never happened.You know, like how apparently a woman deserves to be sexually assaulted for wearing a skirt or a man in a Chicago Cubs jersey deserves to be attacked by a St. Louis Cardinals fan. This is a mirror being held in front of our victim-blaming society.afaulds@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'A class full of ringing phones can be somewhat amusing until you realize that the phones are ringing because an Amber Alert is being administrated to the general populace.This wasn’t the first Amber Alert to be sent out to Indiana residents this week.Early on Monday, two young children went missing in the Fort Wayne area.Since that alert was sent, the children have been found dead.The death of young children is always saddening, but this case is infuriating.Amber Pasztor, 29, was charged with the murder of her two children after they were found in her car late Monday night.It is impossible for me to fathom killing or even injuring my children. I can’t even scold children without feeling guilty after.Not only is she suspected of killing the two children, police have suggested that she may be behind the death of an elderly man, too.Official reports have not yet been released if this is the case, but it is highly plausible.What struck me as bizarre was that Pasztor came to the police herself to report her children dead.Most homicidal people will take what they did with them for as far as they can until they get caught. Did she confess out of guilt? Or was it a more sinister reason? Murderers that are the scariest to me are the ones who want recognition.Other cases of cruelty towards children have surfaced in the media lately.A single mother in Albuquerque, New Mexico, went online to find men to sexually assault her 10-year-old daughter.The daughter was beat, raped, murdered and dismembered by her mother and three other men.Michelle Martens, the girl’s mother, felt no remorse about what she had done and even claimed she did it “because (she) enjoyed watching it.”As if just killing your children wasn’t enough, this woman took it upon herself to do every other horrible thing to her daughter.On top of which, police found a video camera that they believe were used to exploit the daughter and possibly other children.Thankfully, the Amber Alert that caused all of our phones to ring in class was resolved peacefully with no dead or injured children.Many times, missing children cases just become a post that is shared around your Facebook feed for a few days until people forget about it.It’s really disheartening to see majority of them end badly, or just become forgotten because the case has gone cold.The Amber Alerts have brought more attention since they are pushed through iPhones unless you turn the notifications off.However, they don’t exactly follow up on the alerts and you have to look them up yourself.It’s great that we as a society pay more attention to what’s happening to children now, but I think we could afford to spend more time worrying about the people raising children and what they are doing to them.It hurts my heart to wonder what could have happened to these kids if someone worried about the state of mind of their parents or looked for dangerous signals.mmgarbac@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Greek life is about to be a whole lot different from what IU is used to.A ban on hard liquor? Blasphemy.The idea is noble, and the intentions are as well, yet the initial response has been outrage. Perhaps this was predictable. But what do the new rules actually say?It appears that hard liquor is being banned, but what has been said is only wine and beer can be offered to those who are 21 and older as long as it remains in the original packaging.This is a step forwards, in all reality. Before, no alcohol was explicitly allowed in greek houses on campus.There was no written right and it was just a rule that was continuously broken. The new rules are responses to the many outrageous incidents that have occurred over the years in the greek system.The greek system has been viewed as one that encourages rape culture and allows accidents involving alcohol to happen.IU is trying to become more accountable and more responsible for the greek system by implementing these rules.Of course, there will be repercussions. People already believe these new rules will have a more negative effect rather than a positive one.Why ban hard liquor from the frats and sororities when those who come to the parties will seek them out anyways?We fear some people will just end up drinking before they leave and increase the likelihood of accidents occurring on the way to and from parties. There is also the possibility of drinking hard liquor in the houses but having to do so in secrecy, which would raise the potential for accidents.This rule about what alcohol can and cannot be on greek house property goes hand in hand with the new policy on police searches, another outrageous rule in the eyes of the greek system.Once again, though, this is an attempt for IU to check itself about what is happening beneath its nose.It is very likely that members of a fraternity or sorority could have contraband in the house that would get every member in trouble if found by the police.Also, the chance of manufacturing or selling said illegal and dangerous goods is a high risk for the community as well.Naturally, the greek system will not like any of the rules put in place so long as it can damper the party life they aim for.Do we believe a lot of resentment will meet these rules? Absolutely. The outrage is justified.However, the results of these rules in the long run will likely benefit the greek system and IU at the same time.Hopefully, this helps fight the epidemic of sexual assault on campus that is often pinned, whether correctly or not, on the greek system.When everyone takes responsibility for what is necessary, that is when we will see change in the greek system as well as the University.These rules are just a step towards that change.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The suspect police identified as the masked man — Devin Grounds — is no stranger to the Monroe County justice system, court records show.Since 2006, Grounds, 28, has been arrested in Monroe County on three charges of theft, two charges of burglary, two charges of breaking and entering, one charge of leaving the scene of an accident and, most recently, two charges of attempted rape and one charge of rape.In 2010, he was arrested on multiple charges of burglary on East Melrose Avenue. Court records show he participated in the Monroe County “Community Transition Program” in 2011.Records also show Grounds has served Monroe County jail time as well as house arrest and probation.In 2012, Grounds, of Solsberry, Indiana, was arrested in Greene County on two charges of theft and one charge of criminal mischief.Grounds was arrested Sept. 15 on charges of rape, theft and burglary after a woman reported that a man broke into her North Walnut Street apartment on the morning of Sept. 5, tied her up and raped her.Four other break-ins were reported on the south side of campus the same week.The Bloomington Police Department named Grounds a suspect in all cases Monday and added a charge of burglary in the case of a Sept. 8 break-in on East Melrose Avenue.In both 2016 cases, detectives used DNA evidence to identify Grounds as a suspect.In the Sept. 8 East Melrose Avenue case, detectives interviewed a victim who described being awoken at around 5 a.m. by a 5-foot-8 to 5-foot-10 white man wearing pants or jeans and a shirt with buttons, according to the probable cause affidavit for Grounds’ arrest.“Shut the fuck up, or I will kill you,” the man said, according to the affidavit. “You’re going to do what I say, or I’ll kill you.”The man then tied the woman’s hands behind her back and proceeded to rape her.He untied her before fleeing the apartment and possibly stealing the woman’s iPhone, according to the affidavit. The phone was never found.The woman later completed a sexual assault evidence kit at the hospital, and detectives took a cup from the woman’s home that was believed to have been touched by the suspect during the assault. DNA recovered from the cup and sexual assault evidence kit helped the Indiana State Police lab identify a presumptive hit in their Combined DNA Index System that matched Grounds, according to the affidavit.Detectives said they originally did not believe the Sept. 8 break-in and rape were connected to the string of four burglaries, according to the BPD release.However, Grounds’ DNA was also found in the apartment on East Melrose Avenue, where a 22-year-old woman reported waking up to see a masked man crouching next to her bed.In the other three reported break-ins, occurring in the early morning hours of Sept. 5 and Sept. 8 on South Henderson Street, South Washington Street and East Second Street, all victims reported seeing a masked man who likely entered the homes through unlocked doors. Rape was attempted in two of the three break-ins.BPD is continuing to investigate all of these reported break-ins as connected cases with Grounds as a suspect.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Following a difficult year in the Office of Student Ethics, students and administrators met Thursday evening to discuss better means of communication and changes to IU’s Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Conduct.The meeting, put on by student group Raising Awareness for Interactions and Sexual Encounters, also brought discussion of several new positions implemented within the Office of Student Ethics following resignation of the office’s former director Jason Casares last February after he was accused of rape, though the case was later dismissed.“Last year was a hard year in the Office of Student Ethics,” Dean of Students Lori Reesor said. “A very, very difficult year. I know a number of things happened and changes were made.”In the 90-minute open forum attended by representatives from the Feminist Student Association, Safe Sisters, Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault and Student Assault Crisis Services, Reesor explained the changes made during the summer leading up to this school year.The changes, which focused primarily on refining the University’s definition of consent and sexual assault, also included the hiring of personnel in the Office of Student Ethics and the creation of a dedicated four-person team to investigate only issues of sexual assault.Previously, administrators in this role have also simultaneously investigated cases related to academic misconduct and other student conduct violations.“One of the things we recognized pretty quickly with that model is this is an expertise area,” Interim Dean of Student Ethics Libby Spotts said. “This is an area that needs a lot of attention.”Spotts said the Office of Student Ethics will have a full staff within the next two weeks.After explaining these changes, the full classroom of about 30 in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs opened to dialogue between students and the four attending administrators.In addition to Reesor and Spotts, panelists included Assistant Dean of Students for Women’s and Gender Affairs Leslie Fasone and Chief Student Welfare and Title IX Officer Emily Springston.In the conversation, students raised questions about how the University educates incoming students on the topic of consent, how student organizations are held accountable for their actions and how the University can address verbal aggressions not included in the student code of conduct, such as cat-calling.The panel encouraged students to report these issues, so administrators can more easily identify problem spots on campus.“That would be my dream — that we can address every potential behavioral violation before it becomes an actual code violation,” Spotts said.Lauren Rothstein, a junior and communications director for FSA, raised concerns about IU’s lack of notification following five off-campus home invasions last week in areas predominantly housed by students.“I’m concerned about the fact that we’re not getting reports,” Rothstein said. “If those weren’t reported, then I don’t know how many more we haven’t been hearing about.”Reesor explained the University’s lack of response as a misunderstanding of how students would prefer to receive safety updates, via email or social media.“I don’t think what we did was very productive and that we should have done that,” Reesor said about the University’s lack of response. “Now we’re trying to figure out how not to do that and what’s the best way to fix that.”Reesor said she and University public safety officials met this week to discuss ways of better communication with students.When asked at the end of the night if there were still questions, hands went up throughout the room and students expressed a desire to meet with administrators again.“I’m still not fully satisfied with the system,” Rothstein said. “Obviously it’s not like an immediate change that can be done, but it’s good that they seem open to addressing it.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'It’s fair to say woman-led comedy acts have been on the rise for the past twenty years. While still not truly accepted into the male-dominated world of comedy, just the presence of this horde of women giving their own punk rock flair to comedy is a sign of change.Unfortunately, for every Robin Williams or George Carlin, there must always be that one Andrew Dice Clay.In a comedy world blessed with Tina Fey and Sarah Silverman, we must also be infected with the virus that is Lena Dunham.Recently, Dunham received backlash for complaining about the Met Gala this year in a video interview with Amy Schumer through “Lenny Letter.”Dunham’s dilemma? She said she didn’t think New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. objectified her enough.“It was like he looked at me and he determined I was not the shape of a woman by his standards,” she said in the conversation. “He was like, ‘That’s a marshmallow. That’s a child. That’s a dog.’”The assumption that men prioritize other women based on their size and shape is obviously a stereotype Dunham should be educated enough not to perpetuate.Also, truly complaining about a guy not trying actively to get into your pants at a professional event is one of the most embarrassing things I have ever heard from a self-proclaimed feminist.It would be like a woman complaining because the car full of guys that passed her didn’t roll down their window and catcall her. I don’t know whether to laugh or feel awkward about this whole thing.Through the years, Dunham has been called the voice of a generation by various publications and fans.They aren’t wrong either. But is it our generation? Not even close.Instead, Dunham speaks for our grandmothers’ generation, the bra-burning, radical misandrists who virtually ignored the rights of transgender women, queer women and women of color. She’s a second-wave feminist living in a third-wave feminist world.Honestly, even to attempt to associate her with the feminist movement is nothing short of a blatant insult to more than 200 years of progress in women’s rights.Dunham’s popular HBO series “Girls” is set in a world where women of color are scarce in New York City.You know, because a city with more than 8.5 million people must be so whitewashed.When asked on NPR about her lack of diversity, Dunham claimed it was because she didn’t understand the world of non-white people.“I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can’t speak to accurately,” Dunham said.Apparently hiring black Hollywood writers is difficult or something.However, this isn’t even close to the most hypocritical and repulsive thing Dunham has done in her life. In her 2014 memoir “Not that Kind of Girl,” she admits to sexually assaulting her little sister, Grace Dunham.“She didn’t resist,” she said in the memoir.There’s something very disturbing about that choice of words. Dunham defended her assault in a tweet as simply being the actions of a weird seven-year-old, but she still tried to make light of what thousands of women go through every year.Before this incident, Dunham said she would commonly try to get her little sister to kiss her by using “anything a sexual predator might do.”What?While she said she regrets using the sexual predator metaphor, Dunham refuses to apologize for what she did to her sister. She said she grew up in a sexually healthy environment where such an act is seen as normal.It’s clear — based on her entire feminist platform — Dunham has no real conception of normalcy. If ignoring and promoting racism and making fun of sexual assault is not only normal but revered in your world, then I want no part of it.afaulds@indiana.edu | @a_faulds9615',\n",

       "  'body': 'Students Against State Violence voted Sunday night at its first mass meeting of the semester to ratify three demands, which were the dissolution of the IU Police Department, a restructuring of the Office of Student Ethics and a change in general education requirements. They also voted to approve a mass demonstration.SASV, an organization active on campus since fall 2014, works against poverty, deportation, militarism, police violence and the prison system.The first demand aims to redirect funds toward educational resources for underrepresented minority students and faculty and students from low-income backgrounds by dissolving IUPD and the IU Police Academy.The second demand focuses on imposing immediate consequences on perpetrators of sexual assault by restructuring the OES to make it autonomous.The third demand aims to educate students, faculty and staff on social justice by shifting the priorities of general education requirements.After presenting the demands, meeting facilitator Keenan Rhodes instructed attendees to discuss the points and supporting statistics at their tables.“We’re not here to show off our ego, show off how much we know,” Rhodes said, addressing eight round tables full of people in the Neal-Marshall Grand Hall. “We’re here to build with one another.”Conversation waned after about 15 minutes after focusing on precision of language and questions about how the demands could be carried out.“Time to bring it back to the big circle,” Rhodes said.After each table presented their main points of discussion, hands raised to vote on each individual demand.A sea of hands greeted each one to indicate overwhelming support.“Y’all are really loving this,” Rhodes said after seeing the response to the second demand. “I’m loving y’all.”Rhodes said each demand is open to refining with more group discussion.The final vote of the evening approved a proposed mass demonstration during Homecoming on Oct. 15. The goals of the protest, which is still in the planning stage, include embarrassing the administration in front of donors, disrupting the process of the event and ultimately presenting the three major demands to the wider student body.People attended the meeting for countless reasons.Bella Chavez, a senior studying microbiology, said she came because the government does not work for people like her, a Chicana originally from a working class family on the south side of Chicago.“No matter what you do in life, especially as a doctor, you’re going to have to deal with issues like this,” Chavez said, referring to social justice topics like race and gender inequality. “If more people realize that, I think the want to go into diversity classes would be greater.”Stanley Njuguna, a sophomore involved with IU Students for a Democratic Society, said he came because he doesn’t want to waste the power he has as a student.“As someone who is constantly civically engaged, you come across people who are always wondering what they can do to be involved, what they can do to make a dent on these large, national, systematic issues that feel too far beyond them,” he said. “And I’m very glad that each of you is here today because we are creating that outlet for our fellow students and community members.”Elijah Pouges, a junior involved in the IU Black Student Union, said he came because systems are broken and he has never seen IUPD function in a way that makes campus safe.“I’m here tonight to stand up for new truths that I’ve come to believe,” he said.',\n",

They went to bed not knowing a terrifying situation would soon occur. Hours later, Bloomington awoke to horrible news. Three separate break-ins happened in the early hours of Thursday morning. It was reported a masked man was seemingly responsible for each of the incidents. In one case Thursday morning and in another case on Monday, he also attempted rape.As one roommate recalled the incident to IDS reporters, “He went into the victim’s room, where she slept. He threatened to kill her with a gun if she did not take her clothes off. She screamed. He threw her phone underneath her bed and fled, yelling, ‘You’re a bitch,’ before slamming the door.”Right away, students began to ask questions. Who was this man? More importantly, why weren’t we alerted about the break-ins?We at the Editorial Board are very concerned about the lack of alerts. We can recount incidents where we got alerts for far more minor incidents.However, it turns out that the break-ins simply happened outside of the area that qualifies for students to receive text alerts and calls. Understandably, many students were still upset. The crimes occurred in close proximity to campus, and many of us live in these areas.With or without alerts, many people are starting to behave more cautiously. It’s no big secret that many college students don’t lock their doors.We understand why it is easy to forget; roommates come in and out all day long with their busy class schedules, and it is easy to let a door go unlocked for a short time. However, we agree with the Bloomington Police Department’s advice to keep doors locked from now on. It really is the only way to attempt to prevent the possibility of such a terrifying crime.As for who committed the crimes, there is no confirmed suspect yet. Of course, this makes many people, particularly women – as all victims were women – still on edge.To put it bluntly, we hate how women have to live in fear of a situation just like this one. The women of Editorial Board agree that we should feel safe in our own homes.The worst part is, it is not a great majority of bad people inciting fear. In this case, it is just one person. Because of the nature of the crime though, it has created widespread distress.Many women are familiar with the scary sensation of walking home late at night alone. Incidents like these don’t help to ease nerves.We do not mean to suggest that this is indicative of a new crime wave, but we do think that it is awful that the four women had to experience what they did, and that many more are suddenly worried about their own safety.On a more positive note, the Bloomington Police Department has stepped up and increased their patrols for the time being. We hope that these extra security measures, partnered with students locking their doors, will help people feel safer.Most of the time, Bloomington is a lovely place to experience college life.Both the day and night life are vibrant, and most people are friendly.Scary incidents like these tend to really shake the campus, and we hope IU students will continue to enjoy their college experience while remembering to always be as safe as possible.',\n",

       "  'body': \"A masked man broke into four unlocked homes south of the IU campus this week and — in two separate break-ins — attempted to sexually assault women.The first break-in occurred Monday morning, and the latest three occurred Thursday morning in homes along or near South Henderson Street, according to the Bloomington Police Department.Because the suspect did not flee in the direction of IU’s campus, IU students did not receive IU-Notify safety alerts, said Ken Long, IU-Bloomington Director of Emergency Management and Continuity.In an interview with the Indiana Daily Student, an IU junior and roommate to one of the two attempted rape victims said the IU Notify protocol made her “livid.” Had she and her roommates known about the initial Monday morning break-in, the Thursday attempted rape of her roommate could have been prevented, she said.“These are all your students,” the roommate said inside her home Thursday, motioning toward South Henderson Street. “IU has the responsibility to protect IU students.”The roommate, who asked to be anonymous, told the IDS her roommate’s account of the incident:About 2 a.m. Thursday, a masked man entered their home at the corner of Second and Henderson streets through an unlocked door. He went into the victim’s room, where she slept.He threatened to kill her with a gun if she did not take her clothes off. She screamed. He threw her phone underneath her bed and fled, yelling, “You’re a bitch,” before slamming the door.The woman, home alone and not knowing where her phone was, ran across the street and used a neighbor’s phone. She called police, then contacted her parents and roommates.The other three victims reported similar details. In all cases, a masked man entered their homes through unlocked doors and woke them up. In two cases, including this case, the man attempted rape.The descriptions of the intruder match. He was described as a white man in his mid-to-late 20s, between 5-foot-11 and 6-foot-1, with a medium build.It is not clear if the other three victims are IU students as well.In the first break-in, at about 5 a.m. Monday morning, a masked man reportedly entered an unlocked apartment at Regency Court Apartments, near the corner of Henderson Street and Hillside Avenue.A 20-year-old woman reported waking up on her couch when she felt a man touching her knee, according to a BPD press release.The man told her to take off her clothes. She instead tried removing the man’s mask. He then pulled the victim’s hair before fleeing the apartment, according to the release. A roommate, who is a male IU student, was upstairs in the apartment at the time of the break-in.Three days later, the IU student reported her break-in and attempted rape inside her home in the 500 block of East Second Street.Around two hours after she made the report, at about 5 a.m., a third woman, 33, reported that a masked man broke into her home in the 1300 block of South Washington Street. She woke up to her dog barking and found the man outside her bedroom door. The man fled.Shortly after, at about 6 a.m., a fourth woman, 22, reported that a masked man broke into her apartment inside Regency Court Apartments. The man crouched next to her bed. She screamed, and the man fled, according to the release.BPD received a fifth off-campus report of a home invasion early this week. In a neighborhood just west of Memorial Stadium, on North Walnut Street, a woman reported an intruder broke into her home about 7 a.m. Monday, tied her up and raped her. BPD did not believe this case was related to the four break-ins south of campus, BPD Capt. Steve Kellams said.As of Thursday, BPD had not identified suspects in any of the cases.BPD does not have a system in place to notify IU students when crimes take place in heavily student-populated areas, IUPD Police Chief Laury Flint said.“I know a lot of students feel that IU is responsible for their safety regardless of where they are, but we do have other law enforcement agencies that we work closely with,” Flint said. “Our primary area of concern is the campus.”After spending hours at the BPD station, the mother of the IU student who was attacked Thursday morning walked her to her earliest IU class, around 9 a.m.Throughout the day Thursday, the victim's roommate said she wondered whether or not students in her neighborhood even knew about the break-ins.In her classes, she said she looked around at other students and wondered what off-campus horror they could have experienced that may have slipped IU Notify’s radar.As of 4 p.m., IU had not tried to contact her or her roommates, she said.Dominick Jean contributed reporting.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Four cases of burglary and two cases of attempted assault on Bloomington’s southeast side are being investigated as connected incidents.In all four incidents, women woke to find a masked man in their homes near where they were sleeping, according to a release from the Bloomington Police Department. Three incidents occurred Thursday morning following a similar incident Monday morning.In all four cases, the intruder fled when the women confronted or fought him, and in all four cases, he entered through an unlocked door. The descriptions of the intruder match: he’s described as a white man in his mid-to-late 20s, between 5 feet 11 inches and 6 feet 1 inch tall, with a medium build.At about 5 a.m. Monday, a woman sleeping on a couch in a house on the 1600 block of South Henderson Street awoke when a masked man touched her leg. He fled when she pulled the mask off his face.At about 2:15 a.m. Thursday, a 20-year-old woman at the 500 block of East Second Street woke to see a masked man standing above her. He threatened to kill her unless she took off her clothes. When he attempted to take off her clothes, she screamed and fought back, and he fled.At about 5 a.m. Thursday, a 33-year-old woman on the 1300 block of South Washington Street woke up to her dog barking. She found a man wearing a mask outside her bedroom door. The man fled.At about 6 a.m. Thursday, a 22-year-old woman on the 400 block of East Melrose Avenue woke up and saw a man wearing a mask crouched next to her bed. She screamed, and the man fled.In the release BPD urges residents, especially on the southeast side of town, to lock doors and windows, leave exterior lights on at night, close blinds and curtains and call 911 if they see any suspicious activity.Jack Evans',\n",

       "  'body': 'This past week, former Standford student and convicted sexual assailant Brock Turner returned from behind bars after carrying out only three months of his already-shortened six-month sentence.He was granted this early release because of his “good behavior” while incarcerated.A sex offender walking free after serving just one twenty-fourth of his suggested sentence is enraging, of course, because many feel that justice has not been served.But this judgment from the Santa Clara County Jail is troubling for numerous reasons beyond that gut feeling of injustice. It’s not quite sound logistically, and it paints a grim picture for the future of the fight against campus sexual assault.For one, there has been little to no precedent set for the release of an inmate with such a short sentence to begin with. According to 18 USCS § 3624, “a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than one year, other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner’s life, may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner’s sentence ... at the end of the first year or term.”Typically, prisoners who are granted time off or a reduction in their sentence only receive credit for up to 54 days per year of their sentence.Brock Turner’s early release is difficult to justify, since he had only been serving time for three months — one month for each of the felony counts in his conviction last March. While other prisoners are judged on their behavior over the course of the year, Turner only had to comply with prison regulations for three months.This all begs the question about what would have happened if Turner was not from a family with money. Or if his father was not so staunch in his support of his son as to say that all Brock was guilty of was “20 minutes of action.”And even more so, Turner’s early release adds another urgent question mark behind the question: What do we do about campus sexual assault?Because, despite all of the disdainful media coverage, the 7,000-word letter from the anonymous assault victim and the fact that he raped someone behind a dumpster, Turner is walking.This sends a message to students and to people in general that, as long as you can pay a good lawyer, you can get away with sexually assaulting an unconscious woman with only three years of parole.His release may have sunk the hearts of the advocates on campuses across the country fighting back against sexual assault, as it did mine.But, in the face of this failure in our justice system, I encourage those of us fighting not to let our hearts sink but to use our anger relight our convictions.The anonymous survivor of Turner’s sexual assault may not have seen justice in his sentence, but she can see justice in the way we react.So, if you’re as frustrated at this decision as I am — fight back. Promote programs to assist rape survivors. Educate others about the meaning of consent. If you see something or hear something, intervene.We can show Brock Turner what “good behavior” really is.',\n",

       "  'body': 'With the news that Acacia is returning to campus this year after a four-year hiatus comes yet another greek-life-related memory that leaves a bad taste in your mouth.For those of us in our fourth year, Acacia was kicked out just a year or so before we arrived on campus. I’m sure most of us remember friends telling us the rumors about Acacia in incredulous tones.Fast forward three years, and you have now most likely heard so many distasteful stories about greek life that the Acacia incident seems like an everyday occurrence.Acacia was kicked off campus in 2012 due to hazing and drug dealing allegations. Of course, there are many stories about what happened. These more salacious accounts, exact details aside, are almost common now.In the three years since hearing the Acacia story, countless stories of drug use and dealing, sexual assaults, hazing and more have permeated campus’ student life.Recent examples, such as Alpha Tau Omega and Phi Kappa Psi being kicked out of their houses following various scandals and a member of Delta Tau Delta being arrested for dealing drugs out of the house, further illuminate the levels of absurdity that greek life has reached at IU.What is it going to take for us to reform the greek system?The fact that greek culture has stooped to the point where individuals must be on high alert in consuming only drinks they’ve poured themselves is actually sick. The fact that this is the case is horrible in and of itself.Most of the issues I’ve listed are related to fraternities, and that is where I think the focus should be, at least for now. The ridiculous cycle that currently exists sometimes “punishes” one class of brothers without creating a lasting deterrent for the next class.Fraternities can simply rotate in when one house is kicked out, and if the new residents get caught, you guessed it!The previously kicked-out fraternity can move right back in.What is this actually teaching anyone?An article by Daniel Schwarz, a professor at Cornell, does an excellent job examining whether fraternities have outlived their usefulness.Everything that is accomplished through greek life can more or less be accomplished without it: philanthropy, involvement, housing and more.All this without horrendous crimes being perpetrated within the walls of these houses and almost no one being held accountable.What would school actually look like without greek life? Do people think they would not make friends, or not be able to be involved on campus? Is that really the true motivation behind rushing today?I want to stress that I do not think the greek system should have to be shut down in order to drive change, and I’m not trying to paint all greek members with the same brush. But greek life being shut down entirely would never happen anyway, not with this generation.Until the students and the University hold these organizations truly accountable, and demand transparency, we are contributing to the problem. We can help prevent all the dangerous and degrading activities that contribute nothing to the student body’s welfare or education.If we have that opportunity, why would we not jump at the chance?macwhitt@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'As the University of Chicago finds itself in the middle of a national debate on trigger warnings and safe spaces, IU has stayed out of the fray by saying it does not have an official policy on the matter and has allowed professors to choose their own procedures.In the University of Chicago’s statement, released last week, the university said it does not support trigger warnings or safe spaces because they prevent open academic discourse. In the next days, Purdue University reiterated a similar stance, one it has maintained since spring 2015, according to an Aug. 28 IndyStar article.IU has taken a different path to deal with the issue.“Trigger warnings are at the discretion of each faculty member — some will find them desirable in the context of their classes, while others may find them inconsistent with their academic values,” IU spokesperson Margie Smith-Simmons said in an email.In academic settings, trigger warnings are verbal or written cautions issued with course material to alert students about sensitive topic discussions and are primarily a service for students who have experienced trauma related to the subject.Nicole Kousaleos, an IU international studies lecturer, said she finds it helpful to provide warnings to her students. They appear in her syllabuses, and she tells students again on the day the topics are discussed.Her classes focus predominantly on gender violence. She said students are sometimes drawn to her classes in an attempt to understand their traumas, but they are often not ready to do so without a warning.“Trauma is a very different thing from logic,” Kousaleos said. “When we are ultimately, truly triggered by something, we have no control.”Instead of limiting freedom, she believes trigger warnings serve as a tool to help students work through experiences they may react to irrationally, Kousaleos said.Kousaleos’ attendance policy includes two free unexcused absences, which she said can be used for mental health if so desired. Students will either approach or email Kousaleos before a certain class to explain they feel uncomfortable coming to a certain lecture. She will email them the PowerPoint for that day to allow them to continue engaging with the material but in a way that might be more comfortable for them.“(They are) not just brains sitting in our classrooms but whole people on a university campus, and as much as I can attend to that, I’m going to do that,” Kousaleos said.In a recent faculty evaluation, a colleague even suggested adding even more trigger warnings to her courses, Kousaleos said.She also said she has only heard positive feedback from students and noted the ones who don’t utilize her policies don’t seem to care that she has them.Throughout her academic career, junior Marina Walinski has grown to appreciate when courses include trigger warnings. One instance that stuck with her was a professor’s use of the tool before reading William Shakespeare’s “Titus Andronicus,” a play that includes scenes of violent sexual assault.“The warnings are an alternative to censorship (so) you can cover materials,” Walinski said. “You just let students know first,”Some, like freshman Tyler Burdon, still disagree with trigger warnings and safe spaces.Although he has no firsthand experience with their use, he said he thinks these tools might hinder progress toward the equality trigger warning advocates might want.If advocates retreat to safe spaces, Burdon said he believes this prevents them from spreading their ideas to those who disagree and blocks any progress with converting people.In plights such as the struggle for LGBT rights, going to a safe space instead of voicing one’s opinion makes an argument appear inarguable and its supporters weak, Burdon said.“If someone feels strongly enough about something and people are challenging that, they should be able to challenge that back,” Burdon said.Burdon’s opinion has support from professors on campus as well.Feisal Istrabadi, professor of international law and diplomacy for the School of Global and International Studies and Maurer School of Law, said he believes students should be able to handle a civilized discussion in his class, no matter how sensitive the topics may be.That’s why the concept of safe spaces, where students are allowed to sit in a room and avoid any challenges to their beliefs, strikes him as “bizarre.”From his perspective, at a university, students are adults who need to be exposed to ideas they may disagree with.“I don’t claim to be right. I don’t claim to have found the ultimate truth that is opaque to my colleagues, but this is my view,” he said.Istrabadi explained his classes are more discussion-based, and he uses this to challenge students’ viewpoints. Sometimes, he said, he will stop a student at the beginning of an argument and make him or her debate on the opposite side of the issue before fighting for the original belief.“I don’t force students to accept the views opposing him or her, but to consider them, to analyze them,” Istrabadi said.His classes focus on post-conflict justice, genocide and war crimes.With titles like, “After Atrocities, Making the Peace,” Istrabadi said he feels students should walk into the classroom knowing they may face sensitive topics.He has only one exception to his anti-trigger warning rule.When he shows “Judgement of Nuremberg,” a movie about the Holocaust, for a class, he pauses before the Hollywood feature shows real footage of the liberated concentration camps. Anyone is allowed to leave if they want to, but he said, “no one has left yet.”He does this out of consideration that he may have descendants of Holocaust victims possibly taking his class.“Maybe that’s why I’m not dogmatic in my view because I can see other sides in certain situations,” Istrabadi said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The organization formerly known as Students for Bernie Sanders will return to IU this year as Students for a Democratic Society.Although the presidential campaign of its original namesake came to an end at the Philadelphia Democratic National Convention this July, the group’s members still want to support the Sanders revolution, said sophomore Krishna Pathak, and co-founder of Students for Bernie Sanders.“For us to just shut down because he lost the nomination, it would show tunnel vision,” he said.When the original organization existed, the nationwide Students for a Democratic Society was part of the network that helped create the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, said sophomore Stanley Njuguna, Students for a Democratic Society original leadership council member.Members will now tackle issues regarding sexual assault, participation in the democratic process, Black Lives Matter, undocumented students and other campuswide and national issues.When the decision was announced, there was no negative reaction from members because the organization was still focusing on the same issues, now just in a broader scope, Njuguna said.The talk of changing focus came long before the primary process was over, when there was still hope that Sanders would be the nominee.“We definitely knew the organization would be taking on a new form after the primary or general election,” said sophomore Jacob Mills, last year’s Head of Outreach for Students for Bernie Sanders.The first time he can recall talking about continuing the mission past the election was when the group attended the Iowa Caucus.Njuguna remembers the organization discussing the next step even when Sanders won the Indiana primary.For Pathak, the unlikeliness of the situation didn’t hit until the California primary, when he said he saw the Associated Press call Hillary Clinton the presumptive nominee for the first time, before the vote even took place. He believes the statement affected public perception and the election’s outcome.Students for a Democratic Society will not formally endorse a candidate for the presidential race.Despite this, Pathak still plans to vote for Clinton this November. He said he believes she has the experience to bring stability to the country more than any other nominee.“My dying wish as a Sanders delegate for the DNC and doing a bunch of work for his campaign, (is) we need to vote for Clinton,” Pathak said.Although they said some other members disagree with their decisions, Mills and Njuguna will also support Clinton in the general election.Mills said Clinton is not doing all that she should be to reach out to Sanders supporters, but he does like that she is trying.“Her boss is the American people, and they can hold her accountable for her actions,” Mills said.Njuguna’s decision is not made with great enthusiasm but is based on doubts about third party nominees’ chances to make a difference with limited experience and resources, he said.Regardless of the election’s outcome, Students for Bernie Sanders was always going to continue as a progressive presence on campus, Mills said.“The revolution must happen,” Njuguna said. “It’s made up of and depends on us, so that’s what we’re enacting and carrying out.” A previous version of this article referred to Stanley Njuguna as the Students for Bernie Sanders original leadership council member. Njuguna is the Students for a Democratic Society original leadership council member. The IDS regrets this error.',\n",

However, she said she’s always looking to improve IU’s campus.“I believe there’s always something we can do better,” Reesor said.Another way to increase her interaction with students is through a group called the Cabinet of Student Leaders.The cabinet meets monthly and is made up of student leaders across campus.The group previously existed, but Reesor decided to rename it from the Dean’s Advisory Board.It’s a way for students to get to know the dean and discuss ideas and initiatives with her and each other, Reesor said.Before coming to IU, Reesor worked as the vice president for student affairs at the University of North Dakota, according to a May press release.Succeeding Harold “Pete” Goldsmith, Reesor will lead 13 departments and more than 150 programs through the Division of Student Affairs.Reesor said her priorities for the year include providing stability in the Office of Student Ethics again.Last year, some students said they felt distrust of the office after Jason Casares, an administrator who oversaw sexual assault investigations at IU, was accused of sexual assault.Two of Reesor’s other priorities are helping students feel safer on campus and enhancing diversity and inclusion.Overall, Reesor said her main goal is to help students succeed.In every meeting she attends, she focuses on what students need and representing them to the best of her ability.“I’m in this job because I love students and I believe that higher education changes your life,” Reesor said.Reesor describes herself as a connector. She said she loves connecting people to other people.“I love hearing about students’ dreams,” Reesor said. “I love hearing about what they want to accomplish at IU and really how can I help.”Lori Reesor, vice provost for student affairs and dean of students, will have her office hours during these times in August and September.Her office hours will be updated monthly on the dean of students’ website, atstudentaffairs.indiana.edu/dean-students/office-hours.shtml.11 a.m.—1 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 2412 p.m.—2 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 111 a.m.—1 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 612 p.m.—2 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 1511 a.m.—1 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 2211 a.m.—1 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 27',\n",

An informational meeting is scheduled for Monday that will allow chapter presidents to ask questions about the agreement.IUPD or any other safety organization must notify the house of a search at least 24 hours in advance under the housing agreement.Interfraternity Council will wait to comment on the agreement until after the meeting, President Ryan Zukerman said.“Our stance right now is that we don’t have a stance,” Zukerman said.Also included in the housing agreement are several other new rules including a ban on hard liquor in houses and a requirement that houses submit all party and event plans to the Vice Provost and Dean of Students Office for approval at least ten business days beforehand. Those offices can ban any activities during events in Greek houses they deem dangerous or discriminatory.The policies in the housing agreement stem from a plan created by IU and the Greek community in April 2015.This plan, called the Vision for the Ideal Fraternity and Sorority Community, was created after input and discussion by one representative from each of the four greek councils, plus representatives from Sexual Assault Counseling Services, IUPD and others.This document outlines goals for solving some issues in the greek community, such as diversity and safety, but does not explicitly list how all of these problems will be solved.Sarah Kissel, who served as the delegate for the Panhellenic Association during the document’s creation, said she remembers some discussion of the search and liquor policies in April 2015, but most discussion of these policies occurred in October 2015 when greek community members participated in an open-mic town hall meeting.Zukerman said the town hall is the last time greeks were involved in the conversation about the search and liquor policies.Many were surprised when the housing agreement, which lists the search policy explicitly, was given to greek organizations this month, even though Student Life and Learning began working toward implementation as early as November 2015.Some have criticized the search policy as infringing on Constitutional rights, and some also worry the liquor ban will push parties off campus instead of reducing binge or underage drinking.SLL, which oversees Greek and other student organizations, could not be reached at press time.“My hope is that in the future, there will be better communication between administrators, greek leaders and greek community members so that members of the greek community will feel they have more access to the rules that govern them,” Kissel said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Hannah Wilson’s head injuries were so severe investigators on the scene where her body was found believed she might have suffered a gunshot wound to the back of the head.An X-ray revealed no bullets or any projectile fragments so forensic pathologist Dr. George Weir had to look deeper.The back of her head was matted with blood down to her shoulders and Weir had to cut her hair in order to get a better look at the wounds.He found she had suffered at least four blunt force blows to her head that broke through hair and skin to reach her skull and cause brain damage.These blows were the cause of her death, the manner of which was homicide, he testified Thursday morning in Brown County Court.Photos from an autopsy Weir conducted April 25, 2015, were passed around the jury and displayed in front of the courtroom. They showed close details of Wilson’s head injuries including skull fractures, hair matted with blood and bruises on Wilson’s face, shoulders and hands.Weir testified that the bruising on the hands could have happened two different ways. Either Wilson was defending herself from and attack or had hit something herself.He also described bruising on Wilson’s hip and knees and said during the autopsy he noticed dirt on her knees and grass stains on the tips of her shoes.“I believe these came from where she fell to the ground where she was found,” Weir said.The wounds on the back of Wilson’s head could not have been caused by a knife or weapon with any kind of sharp edge, but couldn’t rule any other type of item out of the question. He estimated that it was something round and longer than it is wide, but no longer than two to three feet.“Being an American the first thing I think of is a baseball bat,” he said.The damage could not have been done with hands alone and required at least 300 pounds of force to break her skin, Weir said. However, this force isn’t dependent on the person’s size and could be administered by someone who is 5’4” and 120 pounds.Weir also said he believed Wilson was still at the time the blows were given because of the type of brain damage she had. Defense attorney Dorie Maryan countered this statement, though, because the wounds on Wilson’s hands made it seem like she was conscious.Weir said he could not say whether the victim was conscious or unconscious for all of or part of the attack.Weir also confirmed during his testimony that Wilson’s blood alcohol content was at .225 percent, which is two to three times above the legal level for operating motor vehicles. At this level, he said, Wilson would have had a hard time not showing signs of intoxication such as staggering and slurred speech.Wilson also arrived at the morgue completely clothed and there was no sign of sexual assault in the autopsy, Weir said.

       "  'body': 'CHICAGO — Big Ten commissioner Jim Delaney skirted around one of the biggest issue in college football — serious player misconduct.Months after the Baylor situation, the question of bringing in players with violent pasts has bubbled to the surface. Should universities allow these players to transfer to their universities and what should conferences do about the issue?Though the Big Ten could have been a leader in terms of this issue, it will not be — at least for now.“We believe the facts and circumstances closest to the ground are the places those decisions ought to be made,” Delaney said Tuesday at the Big Ten Media Days.The Big Ten will let each school determine its transfer policy, which is contrary to what the SEC, Pac-12 and Big 12 have done.The SEC was the first do so last year, banning players who have had serious misconduct issues from transferring to member schools. This includes any player who has been involved with sexual assault, domestic violence and any other form of sexual violence.In March, the Pac-12 joined the SEC in not allowing transfers that have violent pasts. Schools can’t take transfers that are “unable to re-enroll at a previous institution due to student misconduct,” according to a Pac-12 press release.This includes assault, harassment, academic fraud or other violations of campus behavior conduct policies.The Big 12 has also recently instituted a policy that prohibits transfers and incoming freshman from being brought in if they have had serious misconduct issues.Surrounded by a pack of reporters, Delaney elaborated on his previous answer — he believes instituting a conference-wide policy would not be wise. Instead, he wants to leave it up to the schools because of the complexity of each individual case.Delaney thinks the other conference’s polices are fine for them — just not for his conference.“They are trying to figure out a way,” Delaney said. “It may work for them. We have had that discussion with our campuses, legal counsel and experts, both on Title IX and the Clery Act ... To think that you could pass a four or five paragraph policy to accommodate all that is putting a lot of faith in conference policies.”Making it clear what is and isn’t acceptable was a smart move by the other conferences. It takes the power out of the school’s hands and helps give schools a standard operating procedure. These policies spell out that if you’ve been involved with heinous acts, you can’t play here.It shouldn’t have to be spelled out, but that’s the environment we are in. We saw at Baylor that winning can corrupt people’s moral compasses. Baylor brought in transfers with serious misconduct issues and those players committed those acts again.Would the SEC’s policy have stopped what happened? We will never know, but it would have made a situation like Baylor significantly less likely.The policies aren’t perfect — like any rule should be tweaked if necessary. But not to have one seems foolish. What’s it hurt not to have a broad one at the very least?“We can learn from each other best practices,” Delaney said. “That doesn’t mean that the NCAA has to do it. When you see something that works someplace else, people will gravitate towards that.”The Big Ten isn’t saying that its schools are necessarily going to take players with serious issues. But, the schools have the ability to make that decision on their own, which leaves the door open for winning to be placed ahead of doing what’s right. Why leave it up to the school when three out of the five Power Five conferences already have a strong policy in place?Time will tell if the Big Ten’s inaction was the right course of action.',\n",

The two entered and left the door open as Wang demonstrated a few stretches the student could do.Some of the stretches were for the student’s back and required her to be on the floor. While on the floor, Wang tried to kiss her.The student pushed Wang away and stood to leave, but Wang closed the door and blocked her from exiting. He then turned off the light and began kissing the student.The student reported she felt she couldn’t move while he was kissing her, according to the affidavit.He then began to pull her leotard off and began sexually assaulting her with his hands, according to the affidavit.At this point, the student said, “Please Guoping, no, this can’t happen,” according to the affidavit.She attempted to cover her body, but Wang moved her hands and as she struggled against him he was able to pull her leotard off. Wang then tried to assault her again, but she was able to cover herself with her hands, according to the affidavit.A noise in the hall prompted Wang to go to the door. At this time, the student was able to pull her leotard back up and walk past Wang and leave. As she walked away Wang told her to not tell anyone about what happened.When she was away she texted her roommate, who met her outside the MAC and she told her what happened. She later told her dance partner when he tried to give her a gift Wang had asked him to give her.According to the affidavit, the student gave almost an exact same account to the police as she did in the IU memorandum.IU Police Department officer Nathan Koontz also reported her behaviors and stress indicators appeared to be authentic as if she were telling the truth.Wang will have a pre-trial conference at 2:30 p.m. Sept. 12, 2016.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Monroe County Prosecuting Attorney Chris Gaal tried for years to convince the County Council what his office needed was a deputy prosecutor assigned solely to sex crimes cases, but it wasn’t listening.He would annually make the argument at budget time, according to a July 12 release from the prosecuting attorney’s office, after his presentation to the County Council.“This is a county with a major university,” he’d say. “Sexual assault is a constant issue of public concern. We need to ensure that these cases get the full care and attention that they deserve.”Gaal announced Tuesday the funding had finally come through from the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute to hire a deputy prosecutor to work with sexual assault and child sex abuse cases.There was an existing position in his office that dealt with sexual assault, the release states, but that prosecutor was also assigned to unrelated felony cases.Sex crimes are generally more sensitive, time consuming and more likely to go to trial, according to the release, so it was more practical to have one individual devoted to these cases.Gaal’s office took the lead on two projects in 2009, the Sexual Assault Response Team and Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner programs, and has devoted a lot of time and effort to child advocacy and sexual assault prevention campaigns.“Although we have continued to participate in building those community resources and promoting valuable initiatives aimed at preventing sexual assault, it has been difficult to maintain our leadership for those efforts with such limited resources,” Gaal said.Emily Perry, executive director of the Susie’s Place child advocacy center, described the addition to the prosecutors’ team as a formerly missing puzzle piece.“We look forward to working with a specialized deputy prosecutor who can devote their full attention to these cases, and participate regularly in our multi-disciplinary team,” she said in the release.Anicka Slachta',\n",

       "  'body': 'The days since John Enochs was given probation instead of jail time have not helped ease the pain of the parents of his alleged victims.The same can be said of their daughters, according to a joint statement released by the parents.“These last few days have been extremely painful and frustrating for our daughters,” the statement read. “As with all victims of sexual assault, it took tremendous strength and courage for them to come forward.”Enochs was originally charged with two rapes occurring two years apart. The first occurred in October of 2013 with the second allegedly taking place in April of 2015. In both instances, Enochs was an IU student and a member of Delta Tau Delta.But even though the parents and lawyers thought the alleged victims had a good case, Enochs received no jail time after agreeing to a plea deal earlier this week.“They both fully cooperated with everything that was asked of them,” the statement read. “They were never told a plea agreement was even being discussed with Mr. Enochs’ attorneys. They were shocked to learn the charges in one case had been dismissed and an insignificant plea had been reached in the other case.”The alleged victims also did not learn of the plea deal from the prosecuting attorney, but first learned Enochs would be avoiding jail second hand, according to the statement.The Prosecutor also released a statement earlier this week saying there was a lack of evidence to prove Enochs guilty of either rape, prompting the plea deal.The alleged victim’s parents disagree with this assertion, saying in their statement the prosecutor, Bob Miller, presented the evidence of the case in a favorable light to Enochs in Miller’s most recent statement.The statement also said Miller failed to mention a number of pieces of evidence they believe would help a jury find Enochs guilty if the case went to trial“Ultimately, we conclude that the prosecuting attorney released that statement in an attempt to save face when confronted with the type of intense scrutiny our daughters have faced since they decided to come forward,” the statement read.Miller also said in his statement the DNA evidence that emerged in the investigation proved problematic in finding Enochs guilty. This is separate from court records saying there is DNA evidence proving Enoch’s and the alleged victim from April 2015 engaged in sexual activity.Jeff Herman, the alleged victim’s attorney, thought the assertion the new DNA evidence proved problematic was invalid.“The comments about other DNA are disappointing,” Herman said as part of the joint statement. “It amounts to nothing more than victim shaming. The only relevant question is whether the accused perpetrator’s DNA is present.”The parents’ statement concluded by saying the fight by themselves and their daughters was not done. If anything, the statement read, their continuous quest for justice will hopefully encourage other sexual assault victims to come forward and seek justice for themselves.“Our daughters are determined and resolute to seek justice, not only for themselves, but also in the hope that other victims of sexual assaults will not be discouraged from coming forward,” the joint statement read. “Our daughters appreciate the support being expressed to them by thousands of people they do not know and will likely never know.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Whose bathroom is it anyways?Zach ChambersWhen did bathrooms become such a big political issue?In response to an ordinance in Charlotte, North Carolina, forcing business owners to allow transgender individuals to use the restroom of their choice, the state legislature passed the North Carolina Public Facilities and Privacy Act.More than a month after its signing, this bill is still being reported on. Obviously, something is hitting a nerve here.Overruling the ordinance in Charlotte, this bill, at least in part, prevents local governments from inflicting their social views on business owners.The fact governments of various levels feel the need to tell business owners who may use which bathroom shows how far the underlying philosophy of private property has fallen from our national discourse.Bathrooms in private businesses are just that: private. The government has no business telling any private property holder how to use their property so long as they are not putting individuals in danger.Business owners need to be free to determine their own policies regarding who uses their property in what way, otherwise it is not really their property.If transgender individuals do not feel safe shopping somewhere that mandates they use the bathroom their biology would suggest, then they are free to shop elsewhere. If conservatives do not feel safe shopping somewhere like Target that allows anyone to use either bathroom, then they are free to shop elsewhere.One must ask, why is this straightforward and simple solution not more widely embraced?If I wanted to dictate, in my private residence, which gender uses which bathroom, people might complain, but it seems unlikely anyone would demand the government get involved for the sake of my visitors.Jim Crow laws required business owners to segregate their customers. These laws created a government policy interest in public accommodations, including restrooms. Ever since then, they have been something to pass laws about.Segregation was therefore, in addition to a cultural failing, a failure to respect private property rights.Rather than enforce private property rights and tell state governments they had no business pushing this on business owners, the federal government simply nationalized the issue.Allowing business owners to make their own decisions certainly makes some abuses possible.However, this is necessary for a polity that accepts rights as natural and God granted, just as the inalienable right to free speech means people are allowed to say cruel things and our procedures for fair trials ensure some guilty men will walk free.Aside from this, it is almost impossible to see how many corporations could get away with something as clearly wrong as segregation in a day and age where massive boycotts are called and media attention is drawn to owners expressing unpopular opinions.Transgender bathroom laws are just the latest salvo in the culture wars, something that has been raging since at least segregation. If public accommodations were not a matter of public policy, it might be easier to tame these fires.In a diverse country of more than 300 million individuals it is going to be impossible to find solutions to issues like transgender bathroom rights that satisfy everyone. Especially today, when we are faced with issues that are much more morally ambiguous than segregation.If the government is to decide the winners and losers of this battle, state- or even nationwide, then it raises the stakes for everyone.It would be much easier for both sides to coexist peacefully if businesses were allowed to cater to their customers’ preferences. There is room in the free market for everyone.zackchambers97@gmail.comPeople should not be punished for peeing while transJosh ByronThe idea bathrooms are a new issue is simply not true.They have been political and will continue to be and need to be addressed. Transgender people, simply put, need bathrooms.Segregation based on race, sexuality, gender identity and gender expression has occurred since at least the 18th century. The idea bathrooms are private is another issue altogether.Private corporations have gotten away with segregation in the past and would continue to do so if the government did not intervene. As a gender nonconforming person, I have experienced this segregation first hand. All three of my last three workplaces lacked a gender-neutral bathroom of any kind.What am I supposed to do if the private businesses where I work, as well as the places nearby, only have gendered bathrooms. Hold it?I cannot choose where I get hired. I cannot choose where I need to shop.If no businesses in my town decide to stand up for what’s right and there is no governmental law to help me, there will be nowhere I can comfortably use the bathroom.Despite being a small part of the population, my rights should not be infringed upon by the majority. If America claims to stand for equal rights for all, we should at least try to uphold that for trans and gender nonconforming people for something as necessary as the right to use the bathroom.Trans and gender nonconforming individuals are not more likely to attack or rape others.Spokespeople from the Transgender Law Center, the Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union said there have been zero reported incidents of attacks perpetrated by trans people in bathrooms according to an article from Mic.Alternatively, the National Coalition of Anti-Violence founded in 2013 found 72 percent of LGBT homicide victims were transgender women and that 67 percent were trans women of color. If anyone needs protection, it’s genderqueer people.Sexual predators are already everywhere. They will use any means at their disposal. Numerous places where sexual assault happens are perfectly OK: bars, frat houses and even cisgender bathrooms.Perhaps, instead of punishing trans and gender nonconforming people, impersonating a trans person to enter a bathroom should be a crime. This way, cis predators can be punished for the crimes they commit instead of actual trans people.There is no solution that will satisfy everyone in this matter. But it is up to the government to decide which side is the greater infringement of rights: the right to use the bathroom or the right to protect yourself against a nonexistant threat.The free market of our country has never and will never have room for everyone. Capitalism and Libertarian governments privilege those who are already privileged. Cultural and sociological factors like discrimination, histories of economic and political disenfranchisement and violence can’t be ignored.Trans people are a small portion of the population and their patronage won’t dramatically increase profit. But it is our right to be allowed to live our lives when we are not hurting others. The government can and should intercede in these moments of discrimination, violence and unequal access to basic bathroom facilities.I wish I could have a gender-neutral bathroom and know that I am safe in a room that agrees with who I am. If men and women cannot handle that, fine — give us our own bathroom.If you want to segregate us because butch women or non-passing trans people look “weird” to you, then at least let us live and poop.jkrathwo@umail.iu.edu',\n",

True story.My minor daughter is a high school student here in Bloomington. She was on an out-of-state school field trip recently.During their stay, the kids stayed in co-ed cabins and the 10 adult chaperones stayed in their own cabin. One night, my daughter was sexually assaulted by a fellow student. She pretended to sleep through the experience, afraid and unsure of what to do. She did not tell anyone until a fellow student confided that it also happened to her.At that point they decided to tell a teacher. The accused 18-year-old student was sent home early.The school notified the parents of both girls, but did not report the incident to authorities. To add insult to injury, one of the teachers told a parent that she believed the girls had made the story up. I called BPD, explained the situation, and was told to come in with my minor daughter to make the report.However, when I arrived at the police station with my daughter, I was told that they could not take my report as the incident happened in another jurisdiction; I would have to make the report there.BPD will not take my report of a sexual assault that happened to my child, a Bloomington resident, by another Bloomington resident, in the context of a Bloomington school field trip, because it didn’t happen in Bloomington.I ask of you, if you are reading this: What if it were your child?I contacted the local police department where the incident occurred and they advised that I couldn’t make a sexual assault report over the phone. I cannot believe this is going to get swept under the rug.I can’t tell if I’m more angry with the school for letting this happen and for failing to report, the Bloomington police for failing to provide any assistance, or the 18-year-old student who sexually assaulted my daughter.Sean Gorman',\n",

       "  'body': 'Guo Ping Wang, a senior lecturer at the Jacobs School of Music, has been fired after an investigation into a report he sexually assaulted an IU student on campus, IU announced in a press release Monday.The assault was reported March 28, at which time Wang was placed on leave until further investigation.IU’s initial investigation included discussions with the accuser and others before the University decided to report the incident to the IU Police Department, according to the release.IU first reported the incident to IUPD last Wednesday, May 4, IU spokesperson Mark Land said. The university wanted to conduct its own investigation first in order to protect the victim and decide whether the incident was a violation of school policy for its employees.“Part of our philosophy is that while we want to see cases resolved ... we also are very aware that these are emotional situations for the victims,” Land said.IU wants to make sure the student is not making a report he or she is uncomfortable with. Land said they want to first determine if there is enough evidence to involve legal authorities.Wang was notified of the termination late last Friday and has 10 days from that point to appeal the decision.IUPD has opened an investigation into the reported assault.“Sexual assault has no place on our campus, or any campus, and any act of violence on the part of an employee against a student is especially egregious,” IU Provost Lauren Robel said in the release.“The university intends to work with authorities to vigorously pursue this case to the fullest extent of the law.”Wang had been a senior lecturer of ballet at IU since 2014. He began as a visiting lecturer in 2003 before becoming a full-time lecturer in 2007.Wang studied ballet at the Shanghai Dance School and in the graduate program at the Jacobs School, according to his biography on IU’s website, which has been taken down since his termination. Before joining Ballet Chicago in 1993, Wang also danced with the Shanghai Ballet Company for 11 years.Wang was honored with a Ruth Page Award for Outstanding Dance Achievement by the Chicago Dance Community.Jacobs School of Music Dean Gwyn Richards notified students, faculty and staff of the incident and firing Monday.“This occurrence runs counter to our values,” Richards said in the release. “We will continue to do everything we can to make sure that our students have the ideal environment in which to pursue their artistic and academic goals.”Grace Palmieri',\n",

       "  'body': 'Middle Way House is amping up its men’s outreach program following the end of sexual assault awareness month.Middle Way House has less than one dozen male volunteers in crisis prevention services — meaning people may not be able to have a choice of which gender they can speak to about their experience.“We see a lack of male advocates as a barrier to delivering services to male survivors,” Crisis Intervention Specialist Sean Fleck said.Fleck joined Middle Way as a volunteer in August 2015 as part of his social work degree. He worked at the shelter for an entire year after being placed there by his advisor.Through his work at Middle Way, Fleck has met with male survivors of sexual violence. Each time, the men had requested to see a male specialist.The men’s outreach program is a tool Middle Way House is using to advertise their services to male victims as well as to recruit more male volunteers.People who experience violence can be any gender, which is why it’s important to make services available to everyone, Crisis Intervention Specialist Mary Jones said.“It’s a human problem,” Jones said. “It’s not just a female problem. The more people we can get involved the better off we’ll be.”Men have typically not been involved with shelters like Middle Way House because of the history of these types of organizations. They were first established by women, for women, Fleck said.“We’ve seen a paradigm that men are perpetrators and women can only be victims,” Fleck said. “That idea has become ingrained in our culture.”Fleck also said it has to do with the idea of masculinity in general. When men call seeking help from an organization, they’re often met with disbelief about their experience. People think men are exaggerating what happened to them, or insinuate they could have left the situation if they wanted to, Fleck said.“There’s a strong idea of what masculinity is in our society, and people in this line of work are not immune to society’s ideas about masculinity,” Jones said. “That can be a barrier.”According to Middle Way House, 2.78 million men in the United States have experienced sexual assault or rape. In addition, more than 1 in 4 men have experienced intimate partner violence in the U.S.Middle Way House started their outreach program to reach these male victims.The program is seeking to establish community and campus partnerships with other shelters, student groups, dorms and greek life. It wants to make its services more accessible to students and members of the community.The next training session for Middle Way House volunteers is June 11. Those interested can complete the volunteer application at middlewayhouse.org.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Over Little 500 weekend, a total of four rapes were reported in Bloomington. One of these involved a student being held down by two men while a third raped her in the street, according to an IU Police Department press release.In the six months leading up to this year’s Little 500 weekend, IUPD received reports of 88 complaints of harassment or intimidation, 54 reports of assaults, seven complaints of suspicious people or vehicles, four forcible fondlings and five rapes, according to a recent article from the Indiana Daily Student.Upon hearing this news, Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault co-director Alec Raich said he felt a mix of fear, sadness and anger. He said he was concerned about the safety of his friends on campus.“It makes me want to work harder to fight against stuff like this on campus,” Raich said.MARS is a student-led organization mostly made up of members of the Interfraternity Council, with the goal of raising awareness of and bettering education on sexual violence on campus.For the past two semesters, MARS has put on the BannerUp campaign. Members made large banners with messages written on them to promote sexual assault prevention.Despite the efforts of MARS, Raich said he believes more could be done to fight against sexual violence.“It’s a scary reminder that there’s still a lot of work to be done on campus,” Raich said.In order to help prevent more attacks in the future, Raich said he encourages women not to walk alone at night, especially when intoxicated.However, Safe Sisters co-director Jordan Smith said she believes there has only been an increase in reports, not sexual assaults.“My heart goes out to those victims,” Smith said. “However, I think it’s a great step in the right direction that they are comfortable with sharing that information.”Like MARS, Safe Sisters is also an organization that spreads awareness of sexual assault and rape on campus. Smith said each Panhellenic Association chapter has their own Safe Sisters representative.Every two to four weeks Safe Sisters has meetings where they discuss topics like sexual violence, consent and victim blaming. They also have guest speakers and collaborative meetings with MARS.“No one in greek life supports rape and sexual assault,” Raich said.One reason why Raich said he joined MARS was because he is against the stereotype of greek brothers being related to sexual violence.“It’s a serious problem on campus, and I really want to help fight against it,” Raich said.Instead of supporting greek stereotypes, Raich said he encourages others to discuss their concerns about sexual violence with members of the greek community.“I encourage to come start a conversation with us, not a conversation against us,” Raich said.Not avoiding conversations about sexual violence is the proper way to fight against its issues, Raich said.“I think that’s a solution that can help not only IU, but the greater population,” Raich said.Member of MARS are encouraged to be the go-to brother if a brother or friend are attacked, Raich said.However, Raich said he believes it is difficult for men to come forward because of the gender roles surrounding men that expect them to be masculine. There is also the stereotype that men are not supposed to be raped.People should believe victims when they come out that they have been assaulted, Smith said. She said she can’t understand why anyone would lie about being assaulted for attention.“The key point to take home is to believe someone when they said they were assaulted,” Smith said.When facing issues such as sexual violence, Smith said she encourages people to seek organizations like the Sexual Assault Crisis Service.SACS is a 24-hour full-time service for survivors of sexual violence, SACS counselor Debbie Melloan said. The service is confidential and free of charge for students.SACS also provides individual and group counseling for survivors of rape and sexual assault, Melloan said. The organization provides training and advising for MARS, Safe Sisters and Raising Awareness of Interactions in Sexual Encounters.Victims of sexual assault or rape should do what is best for them in order to recover from their trauma, Melloan said.Melloan said she believes students across campus should unify and fight the issue of sexual violence together.“We should look out for one another and stand up against this violence as a community,” Melloan said.Safe Sisters is made up of about 250 members, Smith said. She said this shows a step in the right direction, as well as that students are interested in these issues.“Just the fact that we have that many shows that Panhellenic women are taking a stand against victim blaming, taking a stand against sexual assault and taking a stand against violence,” Smith said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A search committee of faculty, staff and students narrowed the pool to three finalists for the IU Dean of Students position.The three finalists, Teri Hall, Beth Hellwig and Lori Reesor, all have decades of experience in student affairs. After being selected, they scheduled times to visit campus for question-and-answer forums open to the public.Hall and Hellwig had their forums on campus in the past week, and Reesor will present at 4:30 p.m. today in the Whittenberger Auditorium.“I am chairing the search committee but can’t really discuss the candidates while the search is ongoing,” Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Dennis Groth said.The dean of students is responsible for leading the Division of Student Affairs, which advocates for the success of all students on campus. The division has 13 departments and over 150 services, dealing with sexual misconduct, health and gender affairs.IU Student Association Chief of Staff Sara Zaheer said she lobbied hard to obtain a position on the search committee for the next dean of students who will replace Harold “Pete” Goldsmith. Goldsmith will retire June 30.Zaheer said students want to see candidates who are excited to work with them and continue the culture of change that is prevalent on campus today.“We want to see a candidate that will push for changes in sexual assault policy, athletics, greek life and other areas of student policy,” Zaheer said.Hall is currently the associate vice president of campus life at Towson University in Maryland. She also serves as assistant vice president of student diversity, as well as student involvement and transitions.Before her administrative work at Towson, she was coordinator of the Master’s Program in Higher Education and Student Affairs at IU. Her ties to Indiana go back even further, as she received her doctorate in higher education administration from the University.Hall managed budgets exceeding $10 million at Towson and created the Campus Life unit, as well as several services and leadership opportunities for incoming freshmen and transfer students.Hellwig is vice chancellor of student affairs at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Previously, she was dean of student services at Gonzaga University and director of student life at University of Northern Colorado.At University of Northern Colorado, Hellwig received her doctorate in college student personnel administration.Hellwig initiated a strategic planning process for the Student Affairs Division at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. She also served on several committees, from the Sexual Assault and Response group to the Comprehensive Leadership Program.Reesor, who is presenting today in the Indiana Memorial Union, is vice president of student affairs at University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. She was previously associate vice provost for student success at University of Kansas.In addition to two certificates from Harvard University, Reesor has her doctorate in educational policy and leadership from University of Kansas.The University of North Dakota reached record enrollment rates during Reesor’s time in the administration.ww The retention rates and diversity and inclusion efforts increased, in addition to several on-campus renovations and the creation of new student services units.Zaheer said several students reacted positively to the open forums on campus, which gave attendees insight on what each of the finalists might bring to IU if they are selected as dean of students.“We’re tasked with representing over 48,000 students in this search,” Zaheer said. “We’re closer to finding someone who will find a home at IU.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"As discreetly as possible, five women blanketed the Bloomington campus in sanitary napkins.They posted in bathrooms. They covered trees and walls. They marked signs and bike racks and staircases.When she completed her mission, recent graduate Katelynn Dockerty’s purse smelled like Kotex Sport panty liners.Between 6:30 and 9 a.m., women plastered campus with nearly 400 feminine hygiene products as part of the #PadsAgainstSexism movement. Each pad and panty liner bore a message condemning patriarchy and rape culture.Dockerty, 23, created the notes on the pads.“I used the original message from the German feminist who started the #PadsAgainstFeminism campaign,” Dockerty said.The German campaign posted in public spaces pads that read, “Imagine if men were as disgusted by rape as they were by periods.”Dockerty changed the message to replace “men” with “society” because she saw rape culture as a larger problem. She also printed several additional messages to address period stigma and the prevalence of campus rape.“I’ve had several friends who have been assaulted,” Dockerty said. “The administration doesn’t do enough.”Last spring, Dockerty said she had to rearrange her schedule because she shared several classes with a friend’s rapist. She said although her department heads were mostly accommodating, one administrator told her to drop her classes, despite several being required.“It should be hard to go through your day when women are being stigmatized, raped and assaulted,” Dockerty said.Peter Johnson, a graduate student, paused on the steps of the Indiana Memorial Union to look at a panty liner attached to the handrail.In 12-point Courier font, it read, “Imagine if society was as disgusted by rape as it is by periods.”“I thought it was wonderfully eye-opening,” Johnson said. “It’s awful that some people are disgusted by materials but not concerned about actual bodies.”Everett said the group also posted pads the Thursday night of Little 500 week, but campus maintenance staff swiftly removed all the group’s work.“They followed us as we posted them,” said Emily Buis, a 2015 IU graduate. “It was bizarre. They didn’t even approach us.”This week, they chose to work in the morning to create the largest window of time before staff removed the pads.“We wanted to do it in April because Little 5 is notorious for creating a culture where sexual assault is more common than other times of year,” Everett said.In Dunn Meadow, a maxi pad attached to a tree read, “4 women reported being raped between April 15th and April 17th and the Bloomington Police Department considered it ‘an abnormally mild Little 500 Weekend.' This is unacceptable.”“We’re hoping people feel as infuriated as we are,” Everett said. “We hope it sparks a conversation about rape culture on campus.Buis said she hopes #PadsAgainstSexism will begin a discussion about how to combat sexism and sexual assault. She and Everett said they welcome criticism and encourage others to suggest alternative methods of spreading the message.“We would rather hear criticism than nothing at all,” Everett said. “ If they think this project is wasteful or rude, how should we go about it? If not this, then what?”Everett said the Bloomington Pads Against Sexism group will donate twice the amount of pads used for the initiative to local homeless shelters. They are accepting donations at Rainbow Bakery.By mid-afternoon, many pads were missing. Wispy tendrils of cotton lingered on the lampposts after people tore the pads down.Dockerty said she didn’t expect the remaining pads to last very long.“It’s supposed to rain tonight, and they’re really absorbent,” she said.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'For a long time I have been heavily invested in art about feelings.Often artwork that deals with feelings is done through feminine lenses and aesthetics. This takes different forms in different art media.In music, the confessional song is looked down upon as not structural enough.For example, teen girl music is seen as being mindless rather than empowering women through the conduit of emotional expression and exposure.Vulnerability certainly comes with problems and questions, but it is a weapon as well.Internet art group Cybertwee confronts this issue head-on in its manifesto, “romantic is not weak. feminine is not weak. cute is not weak. we are fragmented and multifaceted bbs,” which is short for “babies.”Art about feelings and the criticism of them is unfairly gendered to the feminine.Woman, femmes, trans folk and nonbinary folk are told that emotional lenses of discourse are not as true or good as analytics.Basically, society wants us to talk about and refer to old, dead, white men and their aesthetics rather than those of Sailor Moon or “Get Ready With Me” videos.Femme art on the Internet is often associated with Tumblr, Grimes, Internet artist Molly Soda and selfies.These associations can reveal white privilege in this type of discourse.Who gets to overshare?Whose feelings are cute, whose are art and whose are gross?Samantha Irby, a black female writer, has a significantly smaller fan base for her blog “bitches gotta eat” than the overshare poster child and white superstar Lena Dunham does.Often folks outside of white cis heteropatriarchy — yes, that is a word — are often policed for their emotions.Black women are quickly called “angry black women,” as if they don’t have anything to be angry about. Just look at Irby or artist Hannah Black.Trans folk are accused of being irrational or overly angry, as if their worries are unbiased.This is evident when looking at actress Hari Nef, artist collaboration DarkMatter and Liv Bruce of PWR BTTM.Queer folk are expected to assimilate to marriage, and other forms of sexual expression are considered deviant and over-the-top.People who have experienced sexual assault or rape are expected to either go to therapy and bow out. Or they are expected to keep quiet.A prime example of this is the backlash against former Columbia University student Emma Sulkowicz.Young women and femmes who are often tossed out and not considered adults are expected to sit down and wait before they talk about things.Tavi Gevinsen’s Rookie Mag explores these unheard voices.Feminine aesthetics attempt to reclaim emotion, feelings and sharing as valid ways of dealing with the self and the world around us while still recognizing privileges other folks have.Traditionally feminine aesthetics like the color pink, selfies and layering in videos are something I have adopted into my own work practice.Understanding feelings, especially through structural lenses of gender, class and anti-capitalism is a big part of my video work.Some videos have large swathes of text evoking sympathy and critiquing the structures that hurt me as a queer non-binary person.While femme has issues around race and class, the feminization of the selfie and of art about feelings has mobilized femme people of different backgrounds to fight against the erasure of feelings.My work and curation attempts to bring to light this rich and often underappreciated area of art.jkrathwo@indiana.edu@lordjoshuabyron',\n",

       "  'body': 'In fall 2014, IU conducted its first-ever sexual assault climate survey. A year later, IU published the results, and President Michael McRobbie described how the survey’s “sobering” findings would be used to guide the University’s fight against sexual violence going forward.Unfortunately, IU is trusting findings that aren’t completely dependable.As stated in the final 53-page report produced by the Division of Student Affairs, all 42,085 who were students enrolled at IU-Bloomington in November 2014 were sent emails asking them to participate in the questionnaire. The questions were meant to discover what percentage of the student population experiences nonconsensual sexual acts, where those assaults occur and much more.The red flag that seized my attention was the fact the University asked the entire undergraduate and graduate population to respond, even though surveying large numbers of people isn’t the key to reaching accurate results.Famously, the once-popular magazine Literary Digest polled millions of Americans and predicted that Alf Landon would crush Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election. As we know, though, it was Roosevelt who earned the landslide win.The most well-known issue with the Literary Digest’s poll was that the survey ballots were sent to a sample of people that wasn’t quite representative of the voting population. Essentially, the sample was somewhat biased toward the wealthy and thus toward Republicans.However, despite this flaw in representation, later research by Gallup indicated that a slim majority of voters who had received the magazine’s ballot were still Roosevelt supporters.In other words, if everyone who received a questionnaire had filled it out, Literary Digest would have correctly predicted Roosevelt’s victory.This shows that there was a second reason why the poll reached the wrong conclusion. Roosevelt voters felt less strongly about the election and often declined to return the questionnaire. As Maurice C. Bryson stated in a 1976 article in the American Statistician, “The respondents represent[ed] only that subset of the population with a relatively intense interest in the subject at hand.”Similar to the intensity of that election, another discussion that can summon even stronger sentiments is the topic of sexual assault.Thousands voluntarily responded to IU’s sexual assault survey, but they accounted for only about 16-20 percent of those who were emailed. I don’t know whether victims of nonconsensual sexual acts were more or less likely to respond, but it might have had an effect on who decided to participateEither way, this attempt to survey the student body just doesn’t seem valid enough for the findings to be used by themselves “to shape future programming and strategies related to sexual assault prevention” on campus.IU pursued tens of thousands of responses without considering whether the responses it got would be representative — not unlike how the Literary Digest sought millions of responses and made the wrong prediction.When Bryson observed the shortcomings of the Digest poll years later, he stressed that the voluntary nature of mailed surveys makes them arguably the “worst” way to collect accurate data. Adding an “e” before “mailed” doesn’t change how right Bryson was, so IU must be careful not to take action solely based on survey results that might not accurately reflect reality.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Quinn Ashley paraded down Kirkwood Avenue with rainbow duct tape covering their nipples.“Yes means yes, no means no, victim blaming’s got to go!” Ashley chanted with a crowd of about 60 people.Ashley, a freshman, marched as part of the IU Feminist Student Association’s annual Slut Walk event. Slut Walk Bloomington, which started in 2012, protests slut shaming and victim blaming.“A woman or anyone should be able to dress or present however they want without being harassed,” said Ashley, who scrawled “#BodyPositivity” across their chest.Slut Walk began at 6 p.m. in Dunn Meadow, where the FSA set up a photobooth, tables for poster making, trivia and “slut statements.” Middle Way House also set up a table to raise awareness about abuse and sexual assault. Meg Davis, a sophomore, said this was her first Slut Walk.“It’s also the first time I’ve talked about my sexual assault,” said Davis, who posed at the photobooth with a white board that read, “I wasn’t asking for it.”“I’m just glad to be in a giant circle of feminist people,” she said.Casper Mendes, an agender high school student wearing a crochet vulva pin on their jacket, made a pink, blue and purple poster that read, “Love All Sluts.”“Every gender that’s out there needs to be a part of Slut Walk,” Mendes said. “Everybody is affected by gender stereotypes. Feminism matters.”At the Slut Statements table, visitors were encouraged to write down their own experiences with harassment. FSA member Sophia Muston said the club plans to use the statements to create suggestions for the IU Student Association on changing campus culture.“We wanted to be more interactive this year,” FSA member Carmen Vernon said. “Slut Walk is often criticized for being very white and middle-class, so we thought it was important to acknowledge other voices.”Three speakers addressed the crowd. Graduate student Shadia Siliman criticized respectability politics, Middle Way House representative Evelyn Smith spoke about violence against transgender women and professor Lisa Kwong spoke about stereotypes of female Asian sexuality.“We are not your China dolls or dragon ladies,” Kwong said. “We are warriors, we are survivors, we are human beings.”After the speakers finished, the crowd marched into downtown Bloomington.“This little black dress does not mean yes,” they chanted.A group of men eating outside Noodles & Company on Kirkwood laughed as girls in bras and Daisy Dukes strutted past them. IU Dance Marathon fundraisers carrying red buckets looked confused.“I guess you’ve got to respect the message,” one said.Across from FARM Bloomington, Ann Shedd turned to her 8-year-old daughter.“I don’t know if you understand this, but I’m going to explain it to you,” Shedd said. “They’re saying, ‘Just because I look good doesn’t mean you can touch me.’”Shedd said it was hard to tell her kid why nearly naked people with duct-tape covering their nipples were marching down the street, but her daughter understood the message.“I like it,” Shedd’s daughter said. “I think it’s good they’re doing it.”“What’s the rule?” Shedd said. “Do we let anybody touch us without permission?”“No!” her daughter shouted.',\n",

In that moment, all of the memories that she had repressed from her traumatic experience at 13 came flooding back.She had been struggling with anxiety and depression and had been in counseling for years, but she never understood why she was the way she was. When she finally realized what her subconscious had been struggling with for 11 years, she decided to use her experience as a tool to help others.Fowler picked four pieces for the program composed entirely by women that expressed her emotions during her journey. Because her recital date is in April, Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Fowler said her feelings that she had to tell her story were cemented.The first piece of Saturday’s performance is “Glass Echoes” by Tonia Ko for solo horn. Fowler said its mysterious and lonely mood tells the story of her childhood, with the repression of turbulent emotions just underneath the surface.Her accompanying pianist, Daniel Inamorato dos Santos, will join her on the second piece, “Pour le Cor” by Odette Gartenlaub, which embodies her moment of realization and the waves of released emotion that followed. The third piece, “Songs of the Wolf” by Andrea Clearfield, depicts her flashbacks and the predatory nature of the wolf, then an empowering moment of finding her instinctual womanhood.“It parallels how I learned that I can occupy space and not feel bad about it,” Fowler said. “I realized that I deserve to exist, to say what’s on my mind, to seek happiness and that I deserve this life that I have. I deserve to live it.”The final piece is the “Sonata for Horn and Piano” by Margaret Brouwer. The first movement was inspired by grief and emotional turmoil, ending with bittersweet acceptance.Fowler said the first movement signifies how she came to a place of inner peace. The second is about how to go on after accepting tragedy or trauma.It ends triumphantly, which is a perfect end for the recital, Fowler said.“I was angry for a long time about my experience, once I realized it, and I hated the whole world,” Fowler said. “I wondered how we could live in such a terrible place because, when you go through something like that, you see some of the worst parts of humanity. But the recovery process has shown me how good people can be. Having seen both sides of the spectrum, I’m choosing to align myself with the good.”Fowler said she was inspired by Jeff Nelsen, her professor at the Jacobs School of Music, to tell stories through music. Storytelling using music is one of the elements of Nelsen’s strategy called “fearless performance,” he said.“It’s about evolving the music that you play into something that is yours instead of just regurgitating the music and playing the notes on the page,” Nelsen said. “You have to put a story to the music and make it mean something to you so that you can give that to the audience.”Fowler’s story is as powerful as it is because it is deeply personal, Nelsen said. He said he is proud of her for being so fearless and transforming a personal ordeal into an inspiration for the audience.“It’s dangerous to define ourselves by tragic events,” Nelsen said. “She’s doing the opposite. She’s celebrating awareness and moving through it, her pain but her growth as well. For an audience to be a part of that can inspire those people to look more deeply into their own lives.”This is the second time that Fowler has performed her recital. Her first performance was April 10 at Virginia Tech, her alma mater. She said the reaction there was amazing.Her message of overcoming hardships of every kind struck a chord with the audience, and people came up to her afterward to thank her and share their own experiences. Doing the same, strangers commented on the live stream of the performance on Facebook.“Hearing other people come forward and tell me their stories drove home for me how powerful each of our stories are,” Fowler said. “We all have stories; we all have struggles; we all have things that happen in our lives that motivate us, inspire us or have traumatized us in some way. I think that sharing those stories and receiving them with an open heart is the key to empathy. That’s what we need more of.”Fowler said she hopes people will leave with a more open heart. She will be providing survivors with resources and information about where to go for help and counseling.There will also be information for others who want to get involved about where to go to provide help. Middle Way House and the Feminist Student Association will be present, and materials from IU Health Center’s Counseling and Psychological Services and Sexual Assault Crisis Services will be provided.She said she wants to continue activism through music in the future.“I want survivors to know that there are good people in this world, and that they are not alone,” Fowler said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Candles and sunflowers marked the entrance to Omega Phi Beta’s first gallery walk Wednesday night.The gallery walk was intended to display art sharing the stories of sexual assault survivors in an empowering environment, coordinator and Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. member Carlie Yancey said.Art prints were displayed on music stands, and each was accompanied by a small electric candle. Twenty stands lined the room. Most of the pieces were submitted anonymously.Performances included a keynote speaker, spoken word poetry and live music.Omega Phi Beta’s philanthropy is dedicated to fighting violence against women, Yancey said.The gallery walk was aimed to raise awareness about issues women face, she said. It’s an opportunity for people who haven’t been directly affected by sexual assault to learn from survivors’ stories.Jennifer Samaniego Burch, crisis intervention services coordinator at Middle Way House, spoke about her personal experience as a survivor of sexual assault and emphasized the importance of the community’s attitude toward survivors.“It’s super important to create a space in which survivors feel safe coming forward,” she said.If survivors’ stories are met with empathy instead of blame, she said, it can change their trajectory.It’s important to recognize issues of sexual assault aren’t temporary, but are real things that survivors face constantly, she said.Admission to the event was a $3 suggested donation benefiting Middle Way House. Omega Phi Beta member Deisy Lopez said the gallery walk is the sorority’s first event acting as a fundraiser for Middle Way.Marselis Byers performed a spoken word poem titled “My Wife.”“The poem brings to light things African Americans have survived,” he said. “Tonight’s all about survivorship and moving forward.”Communicating through art allows for a level of intimacy usually not reached, Byers said.“Art is the physical manifestation of thought,” he said. “All art is a way of communicating all the depth, all the nooks and crannies of the mind.”One piece featured a girl standing with her back to the camera with “not apologizing for my gendered form has been my greatest act of political resistance” written over her back.Staysha Asoera said this piece stuck out to her especially.Asoera said art has the power to form emotional connections that can’t be found in other mediums.Events like the gallery walk are necessary on campus, Omega Phi Beta member Anahy Mayorga said, especially after Little 500.“We just wanted to create an atmosphere where people could come and feel open and welcome to share their feelings and what they’ve gone through,” Mayorga said. “We want this to be a healing place for them.”',\n",

Unfortunately, these reports represent a pattern of violence extending beyond one week. We refuse to accept this as the status quo.Our collective mission is to bring about greater unity and cooperation among all students. This can only happen if students need not fear one another in their own community. We believe it is possible to have celebration without exploitation. As arts, governance and cultural organizations, we work year-round to make that a reality. But it can only be done with the cooperation of all students. America’s Greatest College Weekend can only live up to its name when we no longer expect reports of death, rape and violence to share the front page with the races’ winners. We will continue to create programs and resources to combat sexual assault, but we need your help to work beyond awareness and bystander intervention alone. The burden will always fall on perpetrators to recognize what constitutes rape and sexual assault, and categorically end it. Additionally, we must commend the survivors for their bravery in reporting. It is the only way the community can understand the depth of the problem and work to solve it.April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month.Campus-wide events for Sexual Assault Awareness Month can be found at https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/dean-students/sexual-violence/its-on-us/sexualassault-awareness-month.shtml.Understanding informational and reporting resources is critical.

       "  'body': 'Bloomington police experienced an abnormally mild Little 500 weekend this year, reporting 549 calls for service, 103 cases and 41 arrests between 12 a.m. Friday and noon Sunday.“That’s a very quiet Little 5 for us,” Bloomington Police Department Capt. Steve Kellams said. “Especially with the warm weather, we really expected to get hammered.”BPD averages about 300 calls for service on a typical day. This Little 500 weekend resulted in lighter volumes of police reports than a typical home football game weekend, Kellams said.“I attribute that to good defense,” Kellams said. BPD was heavily staffed all weekend and had officers and detectives driving and walking through neighborhoods and outside the downtown bars every night.The IU Police Department arrested 33 people during the weekend, IUPD Capt. Andy Stephenson said.Despite the lighter call volumes, several sexual assaults and rapes were reported to BPD and IUPD. In addition to the two alleged rapes reported in the IDS from the weekend, another woman reported a sexual assault in the early hours of Sunday morning after going home from a bar with a man she knew.No arrest has been made and BPD will continue to investigate the case, Kellams said.The 23-year-old woman had been drinking at a bar all day Saturday with her girlfriends when she saw a man she knew, Kellams said. Later that day, her friends left, and she stayed behind at the bar with the 22-year-old man.The woman’s friends later found her at the man’s house on the 500 block of East 7th Street. She was wearing his clothing, but neither the woman nor the man remembered anything that had happened between them, Kellams said.The woman’s friend convinced her to go to IU Health Bloomington Hospital for a sexual assault nurse examination kit.BPD arrived at the hospital to take the sexual assault report. Detectives plan to reach out to the woman again this week to seek out additional details or determine how she would like to proceed with the investigation, Kellams said.Kellams could not confirm whether or not the two people involved were students, but due to the nature of the incident and the bar setting during Little 500, he said it is likely students were in some way involved with the case.In a separate case, nearly a dozen drunken people were involved in a fight on Kirkwood Avenue between Grant and Dunn streets early morning Sunday that resulted in a stabbing and several alcohol-related arrests.All of the 11 people involved were uncooperative with police, Kellams said, and officials were unable to make any arrests in connection with the stabbing itself.However, at least four people were arrested on unrelated preliminary charges: One IU student faces a public intoxication charge, another IU student faces public intoxication and disorderly conduct charges, and a non-IU student faces battery, disorderly conduct and public intoxication charges.A 24-year-old male was stabbed during the fight and sustained a small laceration to the right side of his chest, Kellams said. He tried to leave the scene of the fight but was stopped by responding officers.The man was taken to IU Health Bloomington Hospital and was treated for injuries. He was not arrested, Kellams said.All of the witnesses and people involved refused to provide authorities with any information about the stabbing, making it impossible for BPD to proceed with an investigation.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A teenager in Columbus, Ohio, is accused of livestreaming a freind’s sexual assault.Using the app Periscope, the teenager supposedly filmed as a mutual acquaintance assaulted one of her friends.This incident was reportedly noticed by one of the filmer’s friends in another state and reported to the authorities, reported the Guardian.Incidents of sexual assault, such as the rape of a student this past Little 500 weekend, should be handled in accordance with responsibility of those involved.But, when assault happens on the other side of the screen in the digital age, it begs the question of whose responsibility it is to find inappropriate and illegal content on social media platforms such as these.Companies operating social media platforms retain the right to censor content on their apps and websites.We do not mean to pass judgement on what types of content should be taken down from websites.That is an individual decision that each company must make when deciding issues about their brand and customer perceptions.Some corporations will be more interested in putting forward a family-friendly image while others will want to gain a reputation for free thought and expression.Our purpose here is to discuss how wrong and blatantly illegal content such as that discussed above should be handled.It is impractical to expect social media companies to sort through all the content produced every day on their platforms, such a task is impossible with the amount of data generated today.While it may be feasible to use bots to do this, the process would still require a human to make the final decision on whether something should be taken down or not.Profit-motivated companies are likely unwilling to do such a thing, and any law requiring them to would dance dangerously close to violating the First Amendment.Instead, it seems what happened in this case is the best way to handle these sorts of issues.Responsible reporting on the part of other users is likely the most efficient and only practical way to monitor the mass of content created every day for social media.Users within the social networks of their friends are capable of making the best decisions about when to report inappropriate content.Speaking in generalities, a poster’s friends should be best equipped to make the judgement call about when their friend is being hyperbolic versus actually making real threats or serious posts.This is something bots would not be capable of doing.Additionally, this sort of volunteer monitoring would be free for companies.Once reported, a company’s brand and image come into question, so those within the corporation would be willing and able to make the call on whether or not the content needs to be removed.Such a system is not necessarily ideal; other users may be of a similar mindset as those posting illegal content, or just simply not care enough to take the steps necessary to alert others.However, it seems the best solution given that other options are themselves expensive and therefore unlikely to be adopted in large measure by companies and may be illegal if required by statute.',\n",

       "  'body': \"A 19-year-old female IU student reported she was raped Sunday morning at about midnight, according to an IU Notify alert sent via email and text.The crime occurred near Bryan Avenue after the student left a house party and was walking alone. The victim reported she was approached by three men she didn't know and then raped in the street, IU Police Department Capt. Andy Stephenson said. Two of the suspects held down the victim while the third raped her, according to a press release from IUPD.Stephenson said he did not know if the three men are students.One man was wearing camouflage shorts and a tank top, one was wearing shorts and a short sleeved shirt and one was wearing shorts and a tank top, according to the alert. One of the men has short hair and facial hair and was short in stature.Officers have not yet found any of the suspects, Stephenson said. The victim was taken to IU Health Bloomington Hospital with minor injuries, according to the press release.The rape was not reported until more than two hours after the rape occurred, Stephenson said. A crime alert was sent to students as soon as it was reported.“It’s not an immediate threat anymore, but we want people who are still out tonight to be aware of what happened,” Stephenson said.Sarah GardnerA woman reported being raped by two men while walking home from Friday’s Little 500 concert in Memorial Stadium.The woman, 20, reported to Bloomington Police Department officers the sexual assaults occurred sometime after 11 p.m. Friday near the intersection of 14th and Dunn streets. The woman said she had been at the Little 500 Flosstradamus concert in Memorial Stadium with friends. When the concert ended, she became separated from her friends, and her phone was dying, so she decided to walk home alone, according to the report.She began walking toward her home in the 800 block of North College Avenue when two men approached her near the intersection of 14th and Dunn, according to the report.She described the two men as white, of average build and in their early 20s. She described one of the men as blond and wearing a navy Pacers jersey and possibly jeans and the second man as having brown hair and wearing a red shirt and jeans.The woman asked the men if she could borrow one of their phones to call for an Uber to take her home. The men brought her to their nearby apartmtent to borrow a phone.According to the report, both men sexually assaulted the woman inside the apartment. They both wore condoms, BPD Sgt. Pam Gladish said.When the second man was done, the alleged rapists let her go, and the woman adjusted her clothing and left, Gladish said. The woman walked home and called the police shortly after midnight in the early hours of Saturday, April 16. She did not go to the hospital for a sexual assault trauma kit, Gladish said. This is likely because the two men had used condoms, Gladish said.The woman made the distinction in the report that she was not taken to Brownstone Apartments but said she could not remember where the men took her, Gladish said.This is an active case and BPD has no suspects.Hannah Alani\",\n",

       "  'body': 'The Office of Student Ethics has come under scrutiny from legal professionals and students who mistrust its services.Criminal defense lawyer Katharine Liell said IU’s overreach on making decisions for sexual misconduct is harmful to both students and the legal system.From having vague definitions of consent to not giving the accused due process, Liell said the system has several problems contradicting with state law.“I feel as though there are going to be lawsuits coming around against IU, like there already are for many universities,” Liell said. “The system to process sexual misconduct is too biased, and it doesn’t complement legal procedures.”What IU did wrong, Liell said, was taking the 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter written by the Department of Education as a legal mandate. The letter called for stricter policies to prevent and process sexual misconduct cases at universities.“The decisions IU makes don’t mean anything beyond the University,” Liell said. “We’ve spent hundreds of years developing a fair judicial system, and what IU is doing violates due process beyond the school.”The Office of Student Ethics, the administrative office responsible for hearing sexual misconduct cases, can find students responsible for sexual misconduct.The office issues no contact orders, suspensions and mandatory sessions on drugs and alcohol, said Emily Springston, chief student welfare and Title IX officer.The state, however, processes cases on a criminal level. It issues incarcerations and fines to the defendant if he or she is found guilty, depending on the severity of the case, Liell said.“If someone has a criminal complaint related to sexual misconduct, I hope that they would bring their case to the University as well as to the state law,” Springston said. “We can monitor and keep track of what could be a larger threat to the University if we are part of the process.”IU’s administrative offices and the state law might handle sexual misconduct cases differently, but both systems exist to serve their own purposes, Springston said. She said there are several differences between what the University does and what the state can do.“When the University receives information, there is a coordinated outreach from an investigator in the Office of Student Ethics, as well as from a student advocate who can guide the complainant through the process,” Springston said. “The entire process is explained to them, and they are made aware of the disciplinary process.”The investigator can meet with the complainant several times to gather all pertinent details of the case. After sufficient information is gathered, Springston said, the accused party is notified of an allegation and meets with the investigator to provide the other side of the story.A hearing panel reviews evidence, asks questions and privately deliberates to make a decision. If found responsible, a sanction is applied to the accused, who has the ability to appeal.“Both sides are able to provide all of the information they know, look at their case file and stay informed on what the other party has put forth,” Springston said. “The hearing is set after the respondent is notified of the charges filed against them.”Decisions are made based on the preponderance of evidence, which determines which side has a greater portion of evidence.This difference can be as little as 1 percent, which contrasts with the state’s policy of finding an individual guilty.In order to find a party guilty of sexual assault or rape, the evidence in a legal case on the state level must affirm the allegation beyond a reasonable doubt.The law says rape or sexual assault can be committed through force or while the individual is incapacitated due to mental disability or unconsciousness, Liell said.Liell, who said she has represented about 15 students accused of sexual assault, said the University’s definition of consent holds no legal weight.She said students seek legal help and are often disappointed after their cases are dismissed.Liell said simply having sex while intoxicated is not enough to have a successful case in front of the law.Giving consent while drunk, Liell said, does not necessarily count as unconsciousness.“IU’s definition of consent doesn’t define it clearly,” Liell said. “They say you cannot consent if you are impaired, but what does that mean? It, along with what the Office of Student Ethics does to make their decisions, is a subjective judgment.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Former IU Deputy Title IX Director Jason Casares will not face criminal charges after a sexual assault complaint filed in December was investigated by the Fort Worth Police Department.Jill Creighton, assistant director for global community standards at New York University, posted an open letter on Twitter on Feb. 3, claiming Casares took advantage of her after having too much to drink at an Association for Student Conduct Administration conference last December in Fort Worth, Texas.A FWPD investigation found no cause for a criminal case against Casares, FWPD Sgt. Steve Enright said in an email. The criminal case is now closed.In February, Casares resigned from his position in which he sat on hearing panels to review sexual misconduct complaints filed by IU students.Creighton said in an email she was not told the results of the investigation and instead found out through the media. She expressed concern about how her case was handled by the FWPD.“My experience in reporting to the police exemplifies why survivors do not go to the police,” Creighton said in the email.Because she filed her complaint with the FWPD after returning home from the ASCA conference, Creighton was interviewed by police in New York. Creighton said she was not allowed to have an attorney in her interview, despite Casares’ lawyer having a heavy presence in the case.“Detectives only need to speak to a victim,” Enright said. “Additional persons who do not have firsthand knowledge of the incident are not allowed in during an interview as they have no evidentiary information to share.”Enright said an attorney could be requested for a person accused of a crime, but that decision is up to the interviewer.Enright said he did not know whether the New York detective Creighton spoke to allowed an attorney to be present.IU is under two federal Title IX investigations, opened by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights in March 2014 and June 2015 respectively.An IU freshman filed a federal complaint with the Office of Civil Rights in March after having a sexual assault hearing led by Casares in January.Shortly after Casares’ resignation, the University launched a review of this case and 16 others heard by Casares in the last academic year.The review, led by IU emerita of law Julia Lamber, found the original ruling of all 17 cases would stand.In an email, Casares emphasized every investigation of Creighton’s claims had yielded the same response.“There was no assault,” Casares said in the email. “It never happened. I’m choosing to no longer focus on the false claims being made against me but rather my statements and my story that was corroborated in each independent investigation.”Casares added he believed his professional and personal character shined in the investigation process and he will no longer address the “false and unfounded allegation” waged against him.“My family has been forever impacted,” Casares said. “The facts have been shared. The results are final. There is nothing left to say.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Last Wednesday, New York State Supreme Court Justice Kornreich dismissed Kesha Rose Sebert’s claims of Dr. Luke’s sexual assault due to a varying degree of unfortunate complications. It seems that for Dr. Luke the saying “good things happen to bad people” is true.Whether or not you like Kesha’s party anthems, her story is a tough one to swallow. Essentially, through a very extensive allegation, Kesha claimed her long-time music producer Dr. Luke physically, sexually and emotionally assaulted her on numerous occasions.We, the Editorial Board, believe the situation is less about problems with the legal system and more about the cycle of victimhood that is created for those who seek justice.Kesha first sued Dr. Luke in a California court in 2014. According to Kesha’s Complaint for Damages, which was filed in the California Supreme Court and made public by the Hollywood Reporter, “Dr. Luke continuously forced himself on Ms. Sebert while she was intoxicated and drugged,” and when “Dr. Luke instructed Ms. Sebert to take what he described as ‘sober pills’ ... Ms. Sebert took the pills and woke up the following afternoon, naked in Dr. Luke’s bed, sore and sick with no memory of how she got there.”Although she filed the lawsuit in 2014, these incidents took place well beforehand, which is why Justice Kornreich cited the 3-5 year limit in the New York Statute of Limitations as the main reason for throwing out the case.As a tactic to maneuver around these laws, Kesha’s side highlighted the statute of limitations on gender-motivated crimes was seven years, but clearly the idea that rape is a gendered hate crime is a flawed notion.As Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich wrote in the case’s decision, “Every rape is not a gender-motivated hate crime.” While women are more often the victim, sexual assault is a crime motivated by sex and power, not necessarily gender.This editorial is a critique on the treatment of sexual assault as a societal issue. Sexual assault isn’t reported properly because victims see cases like this and give up all hope creating a cyclical system of abuse for victims.Her six-album recording contract with Sony Music is still up in the air. Rueters reported the social media campaign #FreeKesha garnered over 400,000 supporters who petitioned against Sony and asked that Kesha be freed from her contract.Fans and celebrities alike have stood in support with Kesha, and Taylor Swift generously donated $250,000 to support Kesha in this difficult time.Many are outraged by the fact men run this industry at the expense of women.Although Sony offered Kesha could record an album under her contract sans Dr. Luke’s involvement, she wrote on Instagram that their “compromise” was parallel to slavery.It is a commercial world that is driven by both money and whims of the men in power.Contracts aside, Kesha is being dehumanized and treated as a profitable object.As the long legal battle continues, it’s a shame Sony doesn’t realize that in light of recent events, upholding Kesha’s contract is less than profitable in terms of its overall brand image.',\n",

       "  'body': 'To stop sexual assault and violence, the culture it lives in must change first, panelists said during a discussion Tuesday night.Five panelists presented “Moving Beyond No Means NO!: A Panel Discussion About Sexual Assault and Prevention” at the Monroe County Public Library. They came from IU, Middle Way House and Breakthrough, an international nonprofit organization that works to end violence against women.The panelists discussed how their organizations work with sexual assault prevention and covered a range of issues, from the lack of autonomy adolescents have of their own bodies to the role sexual violence plays in American culture.“Sexual assault is already part of the culture, so someone should address it culturally,” said Joe Samalin, who works with Breakthrough.We live within rape culture, Samalin said, but many people believe it’s a separate culture of which they aren’t a part. In order to eradicate it, the culture itself must change.By disrupting harmful norms, it’s easier to call attention to them. Samalin used the example of looking at sex as a competition. If this norm transformed or shifted, that type of behavior will become unacceptable, and the people who perpetuate the behavior will stand out more. Then it will be more apparent that those norms aren’t okay.But altering everyday norms isn’t so easy. Rape culture can’t be stopped tomorrow, Samalin said, but it’s possible to do work on an individual basis.“You don’t need a Ph.D. in gender studies . . . to get a critical lens on your culture,” he said, adding anyone can catalyze change with a bit of guidance, training and tools.Accountability is a huge factor in changing the culture, said Jennifer Burch, a crisis intervention service coordinator for Middle Way House. When doing community outreach, she said Middle Way focuses on the fact that perpetration is a choice.“We’re all capable of being perpetrators, and we’re all capable of being survivors,” she said. “We have to be held accountable.”In order to prevent violence, it’s important to think about one’s desires, needs and boundaries — but also about what one’s partner wants and feels comfortable with.“What do I do if I’ve perpetrated?” Burch asked. “What if my partner has perpetrated against me?”These conversations may seem advanced for kids, but Burch and Katelyn Lipa, another panelist who also works as a crisis intervention service coordinator at Middle Way, still give educational talks at schools to get kids and young adults thinking about sexual violence.Burch said they do work at schools and community centers in three counties including Monroe. At schools, they talk to seventh- and 10th-grade classes about healthy boundaries, how relationships are modeled in society and how they see gender constructions. This way, they are working to tackle issues early, as kids are just starting to question themselves and how they interact with others.The “silver lining piece” of norms is the fact that we create them and we can change them, Somalin said. They’re simply ideas, and if we look critically at the practices that contribute to those norms, we can knock them down and create a healthier society.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Or perhaps let’s talk about rape because, well, they are different.Since it is Sexual Assault Awareness month and colleges across the country are attempting to exude a Culture of Care, I want to weigh in on the topic. Rape is a particularly prevalent issue on various college campuses. By now, many of us have heard that 1 in 4 women on college campuses report being raped or sexually assaulted within their lifetime. It is unfortunate that this statistic doesn’t include men. However, it is still pretty alarming.But what is also alarming is the horrifying treatment that many students endure the instance they report their assault to their universities and local police. Often times they are faced with a series of questions that sound like this: “What were you wearing?” “How much did you have to drink?” “Did you say no?” “How did you say no?” Something better known as victim-blaming.Following such instances, universities might make the claim that they will investigate the case. But many cases often go unviewed. In fact, just two years ago the Department of Education released a list of more than 100 universities under investigation for violations of Title IX in handling sexual violence reports, including my beloved university.With these issues persisting, it is time that these universities we trust in act on their student’s behalf. No longer will the “How to Prevent Rape” signs hanging in the bathroom stalls be of benefit to their students. We need more accountability, more authoritative action, more programs on consent, and early and sufficient education on sex ed. More than that, we need people in charge who will actually listen, place less shame on victims in order to keep admissions and money rolling in, and notoriety.Truly these statistics and testimonies — heard and unheard — of students across the U.S. cry out for action in regards to sexual violence, as opposed to firing professors who speak out and encouraging survivors to consider dropping out. Where is the culture of care so many universities speak of?But essentially, it is on us. *Ahem: assailants and, yes, bystanders*Jamines KnowlesBloomington',\n",

       "  'body': 'I really need to know why Indiana legislators are so worried about who poops next to who. With everything else going on in our world, like perhaps the fact that Donald Trump may become president, I feel like who we poop beside does not need to be regulated.It is sad that I now feel very fortunate to have always been given the opportunity to use the restroom that I identify with, without any threat of facing charges for my choice. Senate Bill 35 makes it a Class A misdemeanor if a transgender individual uses the restroom of their choice, instead of the restroom designed to their gender at birth. A Class A misdemeanor is the highest non-felony charge in Indiana, punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $5,000 dollars.When you go to the bathroom, you go there to do one or two things and get out. After a conversation with classmates about this topic I began to get sick of hearing how bathrooms should be “comfortable.” Since when did people start going to public bathrooms for comfort? I know personally that I do not feel “comfortable” in any public restrooms, however that’s fine with me because I do not go there seeking comfort or to take a nap, eat lunch, etc.I’ve also heard people defend SB 35 by discussing how dangerous it could for cisgender individuals and that allowing transgender individuals to use the restroom of their choice puts cisgender individuals in harms way. Unfortunately for the people that use this defense, there’s absolutely no evidence to support it.Luke Brinker and Carlos Maza from Media Matters conducted a survey of 15 law enforcement officials, government employees and advocates for victims of sexual assault from 12 different states.These surveys they yielded absolutely NO incidents of transgender individuals harassing or assaulting cisgender individuals in public restrooms.With no evidence to show that transgender individuals pose any danger in the public or school restrooms of their choice, this bill is left with no grounds to stand on.Haley HawkinsBloomington',\n",

I have, however, identified myself as someone who rejects mistreatment, injustice and hate.Statistics have shown that trans individuals have a higher risk of being victimized by sexual assault, harassment and hate crimes as awful as homicide. Statistics also fail to report substantial evidence of trans individuals using their identity to harass or violate cisgender individuals in restrooms. There seems to be a FAULTY assumption that transgender is synonymous with sexual predator.Everyone desires to be safe and ensure the safety of our loved ones, but fighting over who gets to use which room to dispose of their bodily waste is not an argument of safety, but a childish way to show disapproval of individual choices.

       "  'body': 'I was recently in a discussion regarding Indiana Senate Bill 35, which criminalizes using the wrong gendered bathroom. Much of the discourse revolved around feeling safe in a bathroom, the possibility of being sexually harassed, protecting children, and so on. Much of the public discussion I have heard around this topic has been of a similar nature. The frustrating thing about this is most people are falling for the political ploy that this legislation is. It is not about protecting women or children, it is absolutely about discriminating against transgendered individuals.There have been zero cases of reported sexual assaults perpetrated by transgendered people. There also has never been a case of a man dressing like a woman for the purposes of sexually assaulting a woman in the lady’s room. With the progression of LGBT rights, let us stop falling for lawmaker’s disingenuous attempts at pretending to protect the “innocent.”If Indiana wants to improve its image, protecting those that are clearly discriminated against, such as transgendered people, should be the first action lawmakers take instead of creating laws to stop a phantom problem.Joe LinksyBloomington',\n",

       "  'body': 'The money going into curbing sexual assault is seen in the fliers and T-shirts during Culture of Care Week, the student leaders circling a table on a Tuesday night and the colorful posters tacked at eye level in bathroom stalls.It’s about $200,000 worth of work, done in response to survey results published by IU last fall.Seventeen percent of undergraduate female and 6 percent of graduate female participants reported surviving attempted or completed nonconsensual sex while at IU, according to IU’s Sexual Assault Climate Survey.Most men and women who experienced sexual assault told their friends. Some told family. Less than 10 percent of undergraduate women reported their sexual assault to IU police or administration.On paper, changing the culture of condoning sexual assault is a huge effort on IU’s part.Most of the money comes from an annual grant from the state of Indiana. A small amount comes from a fee students opt to pay while scheduling classes.There are just a couple of people in charge of deciding the who, what, where and how much involved in these funding allocation decisions that define IU’s prevention and programming.“There’s different pockets of funding,” IU Assistant Dean for Women’s and Gender Affairs Leslie Fasone said.This year, IU will allocate at least $200,000 for sexual assault prevention programming, Fasone said.The majority of the money — $195,000 — comes from a grant from the Indiana State Department of Health. Fasone said the money would go to sexual violence prevention programming and support for students and staff.Last year, the Office of the Provost provided more than $35,000 to fund both the Sexual Assault Climate Survey, published in October 2015, and the printing and placement of bathroom posters, Fasone said.The University received the same grant from the ISDH last year, but it totaled $165,000. The Division of Student Affairs chose to put the money toward an Indiana “It’s On Us” conference, a planning session targeting underrepresented student groups.“We spoke with about 50 students who told us what they wanted to see in regard to sexual assault prevention,” Fasone said.In response to some of the students’ wishes, Fasone said the University emphasized an already growing focus on bystander training.Students involved with Culture of Care teach audiences at training sessions what to do if they see someone intoxicated in a situation with someone else that could become sexual, and what alcohol poisoning looks like.Posters in bathroom define rape and give phone numbers for people looking for help.Sara Zaheer, chief of staff of the IU Student Association, said IUSA valued the bystander training IU emphasizes so much that the group invited people from Culture of Care to its staff retreat.“It’s up to us to decide what we’re trained on,” Zaheer said. “Students wanted to talk about it. It was interesting to see fresh minds tackle it.”Despite the focus on bystander intervention, there were no quantifiable results from this uptick in sexual assault training.Fasone said part of receiving funding for prevention programming relies on continual efforts by the University to evaluate programming. In a survey sent out regarding bystander training, she said the responses were positive.“We saw the greatest measurable increase was in confidence,” Fasone said.Trends in sexual assaultIU’s Sexual Assault Climate Survey asked students whohave survived sexual assault to provide information abouthow they were assaulted. Across the board, undergraduatewomen reported the highest rates.Undergraduate WomenGraduate WomenUndergraduate MenGraduate Men30%25%20%15%10%5%NonconsensualNonconsensualNonconsensualAttemptedsexualsexual touchingattempted sexualor completedpenetrationpenetrationsexualpenetrationSOURCEIU SEXUAL ASSAULT CLIMATE SURVEYThe University isn’t the only entity raising money for sexual assault awareness and prevention. Students also can contribute money, an optional $5 fee, when they enroll in classes. The fee is called the “Sexual Assault Prevention Fund.”The money from the fund is facilitated by IUSA, although the money doesn’t go to IUSA.“We just act as kind of a conduit,” Zaheer said.The fee was $3 last year. Zaheer said when she first learned of IUSA’s ability to determine the details of the donation, she wanted to increase the amount of money students were able to donate.“Changing the money from $3 to $5 made sense to me,” Zaheer said. “We talk about sexual assault prevention on campus so much, the money should reflect that.”Until this year, the $3 fee was split evenly between Middle Way House and Sexual Assault Crisis Services.In a move Zaheer said she felt most students would agree with, she changed the distribution to favor Middle Way.Now, 75 percent of the donated $5 is given to Middle Way and 25 percent is given to SACS to support the crisis hotline. In that change, SACS effectively lost 25 cents per donation.SACS is used by about 30 percent of students who report experiencing assault, according to the Sexual Assault Climate Survey.Zaheer said sending the money to Middle Way would help students who have been assaulted because they are more inclined to seek help away from where the trauma occurred.“Who are you going to trust on campus?” Zaheer said.To explain Middle Way’s effect on students, Zaheer offered Middle Way’s advocacy services.Middle Way Donor Relations Manager Emily Milner said she works closely with IU and coordinates events between Middle Way and the University but was unable to disclose how many students used Middle Way’s services.“I know that all of our services are offered to IU students,” Milner said.Katelyn Lipa, a Middle Way crisis intervention coordinator, works directly with the services that go to people who come to the shelter after experiencing trauma. She said she didn’t know how many students Middle Way helps.“I didn’t even know students could donate money to us,” Lipa said.The $8,600 grant from the Parents Board Association went to a consent campaign expected to launch in Fall 2016. A seasonal consent campaign coordinated by Culture of Care was created for the month of April, which is also Sexual Assault Awareness Month. IU Athletics gave permission for some of their athletes to be photographed in their jerseys next to messages emphasizing consent before sex.At a Title IX Sexual Assault Task Force meeting in mid-March, Fasone announced the confirmation of this campaign to student leaders.“Kilroy’s gave us permission to put them up in their bathrooms,” Fasone said.A student nodded and said, “That’s such a good idea.”Fasone discussed how they were going to take the consent campaign to social media. The student leaders present, who represented IUSA, Raising Awareness of Interactions in Sexual Encounters, Men Against Rape and Sexual assault and the IU Feminist Student Association, listened.Someone suggested hanging posters in the Student Recreation Sports Center.“The gym is where you see the most men,” she said.Fasone and the other students nodded.The rest of the meeting was spent discussing various events the student groups had planned for Sexual Assault Awareness Month.Freshman Anna Stuckey observed. She said she came to this task force meeting to figure out how to help change a culture she saw enveloping all people on campus, including staff and faculty.She said she was furious when she saw an IU staff member point to two young women in cut-off shirts at an IU football game and say “girls like that” are the ones who claim they get raped at frat parties.“I work for IU,” the woman continued. “I would know.”The freshman filed a formal complaint with Culture of Care, who directed her to the task force.“How are we, as students,” Stuckey said in the complaint, “supposed to create a ‘Culture of Care’ if we are not taken seriously by some of the staff?”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Before Jason Casares was named associate dean of students and deputy Title IX director of IU, and before he was accused of sexual assault, he worked in student affairs at several universities around the country.Casares received bachelor of science degrees in criminal justice and sociology, as well as master’s degrees in sociology and student affairs administration in higher education from Ball State University. At Ball State, Casares showed significant involvement in multicultural events and affairs.“I have known Jason since graduate school,” said Andrea Mitchen, a graduate of Ball State’s student affairs administration program. “He is a highly motivated, social-justice advocate who I have seen grow into an amazing family man and contributor to the field.”Casares was publicly accused of sexual assault in February by Jill Creighton, assistant director for global community standards at New York University. Creighton, then the president-elect of the Association for Student Conduct Administration, said Casares took advantage of her at an ASCA conference in December.Shortly after being placed on paid administrative leave, Casares resigned from his university position. Upon reviewing the last 17 sexual assault hearings, dating back to August 15, 2015, that Casares worked on, IU announced Monday the initial findings and rulings will stand.After graduating from Ball State, Casares moved to Lubbock, Texas, to assume a position at Texas Tech University as an assistant unit coordinator for the University’s housing and residence life program. Casares received a job offer from Purdue University shortly after and moved to West Lafayette, Indiana, in 2004 to become the assistant dean of students.The dean position that Casares held at Purdue had some similar responsibilities to the ones he had in his role at IU. His job called for the commitment and advocacy for student safety and welfare, as well as the promotion of diversity and awareness.Casares arrived at IU’s Office of Student Ethics in August 2011 after working toward his Ph.D. in higher education administration from the University of Arizona. He worked at IU for about five years until his resignation in February.The sexual assault allegations against Casares have prompted mistrust in students who feel they have been mistreated by the system. Freshman Hailey Rial filed a complaint to the Office of Civil Rights, claiming the Office of Student Ethics failed her throughout the trials.Rial said Casares broke the news to her that there was not enough evidence to prove her attacker was guilty. She said the process she went through was unfair, stressful and minimal.“I think if they can stop violating Title IX, I think that they can be better,” Rial said last month. “They have to stop drawing things out and treating survivors the way that I was treated and that they should treat survivors the way that they’re supposed to be treated.”Casares lives in Bloomington with his sons and wife, Sarah Casares, who is an IU employee at Foster Quad. He has not responded to interview requests, and the University has denied all requests of personnel-related files on a basis of a code under the Indiana Access to Public Records Act stating such records are not subject to mandatory disclosure.The University and Office of Student Ethics also said they cannot comment on the details of the ongoing Title IX investigations conducted by the Office of Civil Rights, among other personnel and sexual assault-related cases.“I am incredibly sad that he was destroyed by the media over an allegation that will hopefully one day be revealed as false publicly,” Mitchen said. “I hope he will be able to tell his story.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'In 2011, the Office of Civil Rights released a “Dear Colleague” letter to all universities in the United States.The document announced new sexual assault prevention and response guidelines for colleges to follow.The IU Office of Student Ethics has since come under compliance review by the federal Office of Student Rights, a measure that has been called routine by IU Administration.Dean of Students Harold “Pete” Goldsmith said the “Dear Colleague” letter has affected the policies of the Office of Student Ethics at IU more than most other events in recent years.The letter said the proposed and implemented changes were to move toward adhering to Title IX — an educational amendment preventing discrimination based on sex.“The published letter increased the standards of evidence required,” Goldsmith said. “Both the respondent and complainant can appeal, and we also changed who heard the appeals.”Since the letter’s release, the Office of Student Ethics, which operates under the Dean of Students Office, has worked to improve its policies and standards in several ways.The office is responsible for listening to sexual assault reports, among other instances of misconduct, and processing the cases through a campus-specific judicial system.Most significantly, Goldsmith said, they have increased investigations on cases and employee training efforts.Emily Springston, chief student welfare and Title IX officer, has been in her University-wide position since the fall 2014 semester. She said recent and future changes in her office, which works closely with the Office of Student Ethics to administer hearings of sexual assault cases, are incremental.“Throughout this time, I have served as the University’s Title IX coordinator, overseeing each campus’s response to reports of sexual misconduct, as well as coordinating IU’s Student Welfare Initiative, aimed at both comprehensive response as well as prevention and education,” Springston said.Since her time at IU, Springston’s office released a sexual misconduct policy in March 2015. This policy updated the scope of sexual assault hearings occurring on campus.The policy restated and updated definitions of consent, discrimination and harassment. It also detailed the procedures for reporting instances of sexual misconduct, confidentiality policies and other updates to comply with Title IX legislation.Springston said one of her office’s primary goals was to improve student outreach, so residents on and off campus can effectively understand what to do to prevent sexual assault, as well as where to go when an incident occurs.The act of developing and altering past policies is a normal procedure within the Title IX office, Springston said. She said her colleagues look at data, student feedback and other relevant information to make decisions for upcoming years.“In terms of change, I’ve always worked with each campus to track and consult on incoming reports of sexual misconduct, in regard to both interim measures, resources, as well as any applicable investigation,” Springston said.Goldsmith said every change administered by the Dean of Students Office and the offices it collaborates with is deliberate, careful and in the best interest of the students.“The Office of Student Ethics is a system on campus that is viewed as fundamentally fair, and aims to help students succeed,” Goldsmith said. “One of those ways is to prevent and oversee the things that are getting in the way of this success.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Devin Jordan Smith, 21, was arrested Wednesday on charges of rape. Smith allegedly raped a 19-year-old woman during a Halloween party in downtown Bloomington last fall.Bloomington police obtained a warrant for Smith’s arrest March 23. He turned himself in to the Marion County Jail on Wednesday and was transported and booked in to the Monroe County Jail, Bloomington Police Department Sgt. Joe Crider said.On or around Nov. 1, 2015, the woman went to a Halloween party on the 300 block of North College Avenue. She reported being inappropriately touched and then sexually assaulted by an unknown man at the party, according to a police report. The assault ended when a friend of the female’s walked in, according to the report. Afterward, the man left the party.BPD detectives interviewed party-goers and hosts of the party, and pieced together information about the suspect based on Halloween costumes. After these interviews, the detectives determined Smith’s name. Around Nov. 9, 2015, a photo lineup that included Smith’s photo was provided to the victim. She named Smith as her rapist.The woman received a sexual assault examination kit, which resulted in DNA evidence. A DNA swab was taken from Smith on or around Nov. 20, 2015. In early February, a laboratory test in Indianapolis matched Smith’s DNA to the DNA found during the female’s sexual assault exam.Around March 23, BPD received a warrant for Smith’s arrest on the charge of rape. On Wednesday, Smith turned himself in to the Marion County Jail, where he was arrested on the charge of rape, a level 3 felony. Smith indicated in an initial interview that he “did not engage in sexual relations while in Bloomington” during the night of the party, Crider said.Hannah AlaniA previous version of this story said Devin Jordan Smith was arrested for rape. It should have said he was arrested on charges of rape. The IDS regrets this error. ',\n",

       "  'body': 'In Muncie, Indiana, two teenage girls entered the car of two men who said they were going out for pizza. When they got in the car, they were beaten, drugged, raped and then forced into sex slavery.In Fishers, Indiana, a girl was sold as a prostitute by her older sister to pay off drug debt.In New Castle, Indiana, a van at a Pilot Flying J truck stop was found with 10 girls under the age of 12 hidden inside, all of whom were being sold for sex at different truck stops around the state.In Fort Wayne, Indiana, a 16-year-old girl was forced into sex slavery after she ran away from home.Rhonda Patterson said she has met all of these girls. Patterson, 47, is the founder of Unslaved, a movement started in 2008 to support the survivors of human trafficking and raise awareness of the issue. Patterson told these stories Wednesday night at the Indiana Memorial Union to a crowd of about 100 students.“We have a tendency to believe that the women and children being taken and exploited are people from other countries, or people from backgrounds very different from us,” Patterson said. “But it’s happening all around you. They are the women and children you love, and they are being taken from you.”Unslaved works primarily to help victims of human trafficking, Patterson said. Their team helps to find and rescue girls who have gone missing. They also help victims who escape sex slavery financially support themselves by creating clothing and jewelry through Unslaved stores in Muncie and Fort Wayne.“We want to help empower these women after what they’ve been through,” Patterson said. “We want them to be able to say, ‘I’ve created something, I’ve accomplished something and I have worth as a person.’”Some of the jewelry created by survivors of human trafficking was on sale at Patterson’s talk.According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, between 100,000 and 300,000 children in the United States are victims of commercial sex trafficking each year.Not only does Patterson help some of these women and children, but she was once one of them. Patterson said she, her twin sister, her younger sister and two neighbor boys were sold as sex slaves from the time she was six to when she was 13.“The first time I tried to tell someone about it, she stood up, said ‘I thought you were classy,’ and walked away,” Patterson said. “Human trafficking was not something in our everyday dictionaries back then. It was a fight to get people to listen.”Even as awareness of human trafficking spreads and the problem becomes widely acknowledged, fundamental cultural values make it a hard problem to fix, said Daniel Walker, who works for Patterson’s team with Unslaved.“There’s this narrative that men are bred to exploit women, and that’s what you’re supposed to do when you’re a man,” Walker said. “And we are telling ourselves that exploitation is acceptable and ignoring the shame that comes from living this narrative.”At the start of the event, two young women and a man acted out what the violence and force of what trafficking can look like.The man yelled, “Get up here!” and shoved the women to the front of the room and forced them to stand in the corner of the stage.“That part was very dramatic and grabbing,” IU junior Jordan Hartman said. “Between that and the stories that were told, it really put a face to all the statistics you hear. Maybe that will move people to talk about it a little more.”One of the women, Mindy Hurley, 28, has just started working with Patterson and Unslaved.“I was sexually assaulted, and I want to find a way to start something that can help other people who have gone through that,” Hurley said. “I’m working with Rhonda to learn how I can do that. She makes such a huge difference in a lot of women’s lives, and I’m learning so much from her.”Patterson said since starting Unslaved, she has spent all her time and resources working towards support and awareness for human trafficking victims.“I don’t exactly know what to do about the situation, because it’s too big to be fixed by one person,” Patterson said. “But the more that stands in my way, the more I know I must be on the right track. So we’ll keep fighting for these women and children and help the ones we meet as best as we can.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"When Shaylyn Ammerman was taken from her crib early Wednesday, she was still alive and dressed.Her lifeless, bare body would be found almost two days later, laid neatly next to a tree by the banks of the White River, northeast of Gosport, Indiana.The course of events between Shaylyn’s disappearance and death were finally made clear Monday when Kyle Parker, 22, was charged with raping, strangling and murdering the toddler after kidnapping her from her home.Parker also faces charges for child molesting, aggravated battery, strangulation, obstruction of justice and failure to report a dead body.On Monday, Shaylyn’s grandmother, Tamara Morgan, said she was “just disgusted.”In an interview with investigators Sunday, Parker admitted to his stepfather, Mike Patton, he drove Shaylyn toward Gosport, Indiana, in a maroon Pontiac Grand Am on Wednesday morning. Along the way, Parker said he told investigators, he pulled over and raped Shaylyn in the front seat of his vehicle while she was still alive, according to a probable cause affidavit.The doctor who conducted Shaylyn’s autopsy Friday, Dr. Donna Stewart, said this was the “worst case of sexual trauma” she has seen in her career, according to the affidavit.Parker admitted to murdering Shaylyn by smothering her with a cloth he had in his vehicle. He then drove her body to the place where she was later found.Patton revealed Parker's confessions to investigators Sunday.He used bleach to clean off her body in an attempt to destroy his DNA, according to the report. Investigators also found a burn pile next to the body, which they believed contained her clothing: a white onesie decorated with owls.Parker appeared in the charging hearing via a video conference Monday. With his hands crossed on a table in front of him, the man sat emotionless as Owen County Circuit Court Judge Lori Thatcher Quillen read him his charges and possible jail time — a maximum of more than 200 years.Parker pleaded not guilty to his charges and asked for a public defender. Quillen appointed Jacob Fish to represent him. Parker’s preliminary trial date is scheduled for Aug. 10.Parker is being held in the Owen County Jail and is not eligible for bail.The night Shaylyn went missing, Parker, a friend of Shaylyn’s uncle, Adam Ammerman, was at the house on the 400 block of West Jefferson Street in Spencer where Shaylyn spent every other week with her father, Justin Ammerman, and grandmother, Tamara Morgan.Adam Ammerman told detectives he had invited Parker to the house to watch a movie and drink. He and Parker purchased a fifth of vodka and a fifth of whiskey from a local liquor store.Parker told authorities he drank about a quarter-pint of whiskey that night. Adam Ammerman told police that between 3 and 4 a.m. he awoke to the sound of the front door shutting. He noticed Parker was not in the room, so he opened his window and saw Parker leaving the house.Adam Ammerman said he saw Parker walking away from the house carrying something — he said he thought he saw a foot dangling from Parker’s side, but he wasn’t certain, so he went back to bed.When Shaylyn’s father, Justin Ammerman, woke up at about 8:30 a.m. the next morning, he saw Shaylyn’s crib was empty. The family called 911, and the extensive search for Shaylyn — involving the FBI, Indiana State Police and numerous other agencies — began.The autopsy revealed numerous injuries sustained in a sexual assault against Shaylyn, according to the police report. The injuries also indicated that Shaylyn was forcefully slammed down on a hard surface, and smothered in the nose and mouth to keep her screams from being heard.Injuries to her throat were consistent with strangulation, according to the police report.Parker’s friends told authorities he drank a lot and would often get naked while intoxicated.They said Parker liked pornographic videos with sadistic and masochistic themes, and was said to be attracted to younger girls in the 12- to 14-year-old range.Adam Ammerman told authorities Tamara Morgan, Shaylyn’s grandmother, walked into the house on an earlier day and saw Parker sitting in a rocking chair, intoxicated and holding Shaylyn in his lap.Parker did not initially admit to any involvement in Shaylyn’s disappearance. He agreed to show police on a map where Shaylyn’s body was located, but blamed Adam Ammerman for her death.As evidence continued to build against him, Parker told his stepfather he acted alone in Shaylyn’s death. Polygraph tests were administered to Adam Ammerman and Justin Ammerman to confirm they were truthful in saying they were not involved in the death, according to the affidavit.In Monday’s court hearing, Parker told the judge he has not been employed since June 2015, when he worked at a Terre Haute nursing and rehab center. He lives in Spencer in a home owned by his half sister’s parents.Parker said he has had no income since his last job, and currently has no bank accounts containing any money.His pretrial conference is scheduled for May 26.This story has been updated to clarify the nature of the investigation.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'As Sexual Assault Prevention Month approaches in April, Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault will be promoting its BannerUp campaign, MARS co-director Alec Raich said.For the BannerUp campaign, Raich said MARS, a fraternity organization that promotes sexual assault prevention and education, will be making large red banners to promote sexual assault prevention on campus.“We want to lower numbers of sexual assaults on campus,” Raich said.Like in its similar campaign last semester, MARS is hoping to have one banner hung up in front of every fraternity house on campus, Raich said. He said he believes this will reach a larger demographic of people, especially since so many people attend Little 500.“How many times do you see the same message across all greek houses on campus?” Raich said.The BannerUp campaign will occur the same time as Culture of Care Week. Culture of Care promotes mental health, sexual health, drug and alcohol awareness and respect.Culture of Care will be using the hashtag ”#CouragetoCare” throughout the week. MARS will also use this hashtag on the banners to promote Culture of Care Week, said Bill Phan, director of involvement for Culture of Care, as well as a director of MARS when BannerUp began.Safe Sisters, a sorority organization that also promotes sexual assault prevention on campus, will be involved with the campaign by making banners and hanging them on sorority houses, Phan said.However, if any owners of unhoused greek houses want a banner on one of the houses, they can have one.Last semester, MARS began their BannerUp campaign in response to the controversial banners hung by fraternity houses at Old Dominion University in Virginia.These banners included phrases like “Rowdy and Fun Hope Your Baby Girl Is Ready for a Good Time.”“They were very degrading to women,” Phan said.BannerUp was created to show that fraternities at Old Dominion and the general negative press of fraternities in the media are not good representations of greek life, Raich said.“Yes, we want to have fun and have social events, but we also want to have fun while being safe,” Phan said.MARS also started the campaign because of the significant amount of sexual assaults reported last semester, Phan said.The large red banners MARS made in response last semester contained phrases like “Real Hoosier Men Should Respect Women” and “Join MARS for a Safer IU.”While the BannerUp campaign will be very similar to the one last semester, Raich said it will feature different phrases, some that may even relate to Little 500.Because not all sexual assaults happen to women, Phan said some of the banners will be gender-neutral. He said MARS wants to be inclusive to all genders for their campaign.“In a lot of ways, this is a woman’s problem,” Phan said. “But in a lot of other ways, this is a man’s problem too because not enough of us are working together on this issue.”MARS hopes to be able to do this campaign every year around the week of Little 500, Raich said.Though MARS doesn’t have a plan for when they will be taking down the banners after hanging them, Raich said they will have them down before the end of the semester.Raich said he is optimistic for this campaign and is excited to see how students will respond to it.“To get this message across like this makes it very clear all over campus,” Raich said. “It shows a coherence and togetherness against this one issue across campus.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Sophomore Elizabeth Niño and senior Mariana Cervantes knew each other before, but they couldn’t help their nervous, uncomfortable smiles as they inched closer together.“Every ten seconds, you have to step toward the person you’re talking to while you’re having a conversation,” said Vaishali Shenwai, freshman and Sigma Sigma Rho sister.The activity was designed to illustrate the violation of boundaries, alluding to the psychological effects of sexual assault. The Sigma Sigma Rho sisters led the workshop as part of the second annual Sexual Assault Prevention Summit on Saturday.Niño tucked her hair behind her ears, locking eyes with Cervantes and laughing nervously. She stepped forward again, leaving a few centimeters between her and Cervantes.“I felt too close,” Niño said. “I don’t think I can get any closer to her. It showed how everyone has a limit with personal space.”The summit, organized by Sigma Lambda Upsilon, included a series of workshops, a panel and activities to raise awareness about rape culture, legal procedures of cases and other topics relating to sexual violence.Senior Monica Calderon, president of Sigma Lambda Upsilon, said the idea for the summit was proposed last year by their adviser as a means to secure funding. The sorority could put on a symposium, and if it was successful, they could be entered to win a grand prize.“We ended up winning, and although policies prevented our organization from receiving the money, we all agreed that it was an important topic that needed to be addressed and held yearly regardless of incentives,” Calderon said.Calderon said it was important to discuss sexual assault prevention because of its prevalence on the IU campus. She said her goal was to make attendees aware of the resources available for people to combat, prevent and cope with sexual assault.The panel featured speakers from Middle Way House, the IU Police Department and other local organizations directly involved with stopping sexual violence at the University. The contributors discussed the importance of consent, along with the difference between avoiding risks and sexual assault prevention.Leslie Fasone, assistant dean of students of women’s and gender affairs, explained the University’s definition of impairment, how it relates to consent and how it differs from the legal interpretation.“Consent is a mutually understandable agreement,” Fasone said. “If someone can’t understand you because they’re drunk or impaired in any manner, it is important to realize they can’t give you consent.”Fasone, along with Evelyn Smith, prevention programs coordinator at Middle Way House, discussed the different interpretations and expressions of consent. For example, consent is not always verbal.Subtle body language and lack of enthusiasm can be significant indicators of an individual’s refusal of a sexual advancement, Smith said.Men and women are also likely to interpret certain cues differently, further necessitating the promotion of open, understanding relationships.Calderon said the increased discussion and engagement at the symposium was only the beginning for Sigma Lambda Upsilon and its other contributors.“This was our second annual Sexual Assault Prevention Summit, and we only hope to continue to improve year by year,” Calderon said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'March Madness is known for fierce bracket competitions and bringing out the bandwagon fan in all of us, not for highlighting sexual assault scandals.In a bumpy start to Yale’s first appearance in the NCAA tournament in 54 years, senior captain Jack Montague was expelled from the university after he was found to have violated the sexual misconduct policy.Many of Montague’s former teammates have vocally supported him.The Washington Post quoted teammate Justin Sears as saying, “He’s our brother, he’s all of our brothers, and we miss him.”While the veracity of the sexual assault allegations against Montague are yet to be proven, the Editorial Board is concerned the only reason Montague is getting support is because of his basketball star status at Yale.The allegations against Montague stem from a series of four sexual encounters between Montague and a female Yale student in October 2014.The woman has said the fourth encounter was not consensual. Montague claims she gave consent.The female student reported the assault to the Title IX coordinator in November 2015, which was then handed off to the University Committee on Sexual Misconduct.On February 10, it was concluded that Montague should be expelled.Montague appealed his expulsion through the sexual misconduct committee, but the decision was upheld by the dean and provost of Yale.Although Montague has been expelled, he is being portrayed in a far brighter light than he might have been if he wasn’t an athlete, especially by his teammates,.Montague’s teammates wore T-shirts with “Gucci,” Montague’s team nickname, on them before Yale’s home game against Harvard on Feb. 26 . Yale fans at the home game also chanted the nickname during the game, the Yale Daily News reported.There is a rift between student athletes and other students on many college campuses around the country.Student athletes tend to maintain a high profile on campus due to athletic success, especially during a tournament season such as March Madness.That being said, success usually turns sour for people and teams that are surrounded by a sexual assault scandal. Although there is backlash against the basketball team on the Yale campus, the players and coaches are largely focusing on winning in the tournament.After Montague’s lawyer made a statement about the allegations, Yale Head Coach James Jones said,“This is the first time we’ve made the tournament since 1962. So that’s a great story. And I’d like to tell that one going forward.”While it’s natural for teammates to support a former player and for coaches to focus on the team, we think Montague’s supporters are getting more of a voice than his critics.In a situation like this, it’s hard for the Editorial Board to overlook his student athlete status as a reason for his barrage of support.',\n",

       "  'body': 'When the IU Student Association reached out to the Office of Student Ethics last fall, it received no response from its director, IUSA Chief of Staff Sara Zaheer said.IUSA was working to make expansions in the Indiana Lifeline Law, which provides immunities for certain alcohol-related offenses, on a legislative level when they tried to reach out to then-Office of Student Ethics Director Jason Casares.Zaheer said while much of the office was responsive to their requests, Casares was not, which prevented IUSA from moving forward in its advocacy.“If we’re going to represent our campus somewhere else as students, it would be nice to be informed,” Zaheer said. “And as much as we try to be informed, it’s hard when administration doesn’t respond to requests for more information about how these processes work.”Following Casares’ resignation last month, representatives of IU student organizations are sharing their recent experiences with the Office of Student Ethics.While many have said they feel the office lacks transparency, others said they believe the entire office cannot be to blame.Sophomore Karis Neufeld, president of RAISE, Raising Awareness of Interactions and Sexual Encounters, said the allegations raised against Casares were a shock.Neufeld said she had collaborated with other members of the Office of Student Ethics in the past to work toward the organization’s goals of preventing sexual assault, supporting survivors and promoting a sex-positive environment.The mutual understanding built with the office has been broken, Neufeld said.“We don’t really know if we can trust the administration again,” Neufeld said. “Survivors aren’t going to feel like they can report, and I don’t even know if they should anymore.”Eighteen cases Casares sat on sexual assault hearing boards for are being reviewed by Julia Lamber, an emerita faculty member of the IU Maurer School of Law.“There has been a little bit of frustration because it’s just cases from this year,” Neufeld said. “There’s some students who are asking, ‘Why aren’t they looking back farther? He oversaw cases that happened before that.’”Dean of Students Harold “Pete” Goldsmith said these 18 cases from this school year are being reviewed because they overlap with the timing of the allegations.Daniel Niersbach, deputy treasurer of IUSA and a brother at Sigma Phi Epsilon, said his fraternity saw a lack of response from the Office of Student Ethics when Sig Ep was under a Title IX investigation.He said executive members of the fraternity emailed the office for weekly updates on the investigation and members in the office refused to meet with the brothers in person.“We had every intention to help with the investigation,” Niersbach said. “When there’s a victim of something like that on our campus, the priority isn’t like, ‘Better change the facts and hunker down so we don’t get in trouble.’ It’s more about, like, we wanted justice for that individual because that comes first in those scenarios.”Niersbach said the office’s investigation lasted nearly an entire semester and the office did little to explain how or why investigations sometimes last longer than the typical 60-day process outlined on the Office of Student Ethics’ website.“During that period, I wish they would have better explained this going further,” Nierbach said.However, he added following Casares’ resignation, the University could not be held responsible for the actions of an individual.“I think it’s important to know that it’s not the University’s fault,” Nierbach said. “It’s not that office’s fault. The allegations are against an individual that doesn’t represent the University or that ethics process.”Shortly after Casares’ resignation, Goldsmith apologized for a lack of trust in the Office of Student Ethics felt among students.“I’m sorry,” Goldsmith said. “I certainly understand their concerns. I think with Mr. Casares’ resignation we hope to restore whatever trust has been eroded, and we’ll do everything that we can to do that.”Associate director Libby Spotts has been named interim director of the Office of Student Ethics while a committee can conduct what is likely to be a national search for Casares’ permanent replacement, Goldsmith said.Neufeld said going forward, increased student involvement would be needed to help rebuild the trust that has been lost.“I’d like to see more of that transparency and more student engagement and involvement in that process because I definitely think there’s a student perspective that needs to be heard,” Neufeld said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Matthew Moeller, former assistant professor at IU-Purdue University Indianapolis, filed a suit Feb. 26 against the University system on the basis of violation of civil rights.Moeller, who was accused of sexual assault by a student, went through an appeals process in which IU president Michael McRobbie decided to terminate Moeller’s contract with the University. Moeller said the Office of Equal Opportunity and the Faculty Review Board unlawfully dismissed his grievances, and it was detrimental to his reputation.“I was prohibited from learning the identity of those who raised concerns or any specifics that would allow me to defend myself,” Moeller said in a press release. “I was told by Dr. Kirkland, the Director of the OEO, that telling me ‘the who, what, where, when’ is just never going to happen.”Universities across the United States, along with the Office of Civil Rights, have been under scrutiny for their overreaching methods of processing sexual assault cases. Moeller said he was fired, despite the positive findings from the Faculty Board of Review, and the clear violations of his rights.According to the Boys and Men in Education database, there are currently 110 existing due process lawsuits against higher education institutions across the U.S.In 2011, the U.S. Department of Education released a statement that changed the way administrators determine whether a defendant is guilty or innocent of sexual assault.These methods are independent of the criminal justice system’s sexual misconduct ruling procedures. If administrators feel the probability of a crime’s occurrence sits above 50 percent, they are able to find the party guilty.Moeller said he was denied fair treatment from the University in this regard, both when he was initially given the information that he was accused of sexual assault and when he filed for his case to be reviewed through the Faculty Grievances Process.The initial complaint of sexual assault, which said Moeller participated in inappropriate touching behavior, was sent October 2014, and McRobbie administered his final decision to fire him Feb. 3.In November 2015, an IU Faculty Board of Review looked at Moeller’s case and concluded the University failed to honor his legal rights during the investigation, and the cause for dismissal should be reconsidered. According to a press release, they suggested Moeller resign on a neutral recommendation.Moeller said in the release he refused to leave on this basis and proceeded to sue for defamation and negligence of his basic rights as an employee and a citizen.“The process is governed by the Faculty Grievance Process,” Moeller’s lawyer John Mercer said. “Dr. Moeller maintains that the Faculty Grievances procedures were not followed.”Mercer said the Faculty Grievances Process allows faculty to be paid until the conclusion of the process. However, he said Moeller did not receive any payments during this time.The case is an active legal matter, and therefore the University doesn’t have any comment at this time, IU spokesperson Mark Land said.“This would have been the thirtieth year of being alone in a room with 20+ female students with no incidents of unprofessional behavior,” Moeller said in a letter to the dean of the IU School of Dentistry.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A freshman filed a federal complaint this week against IU in which she alleged the University improperly handled her report of a sexual assault occurring at a fraternity party in September.Hailey Rial, who filed the complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, said she felt the IU Office of Student Ethics failed her throughout the hearing process.“They put in the most minimal amount of effort that they possibly could,” Rial said. “This is supposed to be a process that is both quick and efficient and fair, and I don’t think it was quick, efficient or fair.”Jason Casares, former director of IU’s Office of Student Ethics, led Rial’s hearing. Less than three weeks later, Jill Creighton, an assistant director for global community standards at New York University, posted an open letter on Twitter claiming Casares took advantage of her after having too much to drink at a convention in Fort Worth, Texas, last December.Rial said it was Casares who called after her Jan. 16 hearing to tell her no blame was placed in the case and the board believed something happened but there was not enough evidence to prove it.Her attacker would continue taking classes at the same University on the same campus.“When Jason told me over the phone that they found him not guilty, I was literally shocked,” Rial said. “My jaw dropped open.”Rial’s case is one of 18 being reviewed from the 2015 school year when Casares sat on a three-person panel.University spokesman Mark Land released a statement about the complaint yesterday.“While the University cannot comment on the specifics of an individual case due to the privacy rights afforded to all parties in an investigation, it does dispute a number of the assertions made in the media as they relate to this investigation,” Land said in the statement.IU has a comprehensive and robust set of policies related to sexual misconduct that are consistent with those of the Office of Civil Rights, Land said in the statement.“The University believes those practices were followed in the case,” Land said in the statement.Casares resigned from his position as Title IX coordinator and director of student ethics last month. Dean of Students Harold “Pete” Goldsmith said Associate Director of Student Ethics Libby Spotts is serving as interim director until a committee can conduct a national search to find a permanent director in April.Casares’ resignation will put strain on the office, which also has a vacancy in one of its two sexual assault investigator positions, Goldsmith said. An investigator from the University-wide Title IX office has been assigned to assist the office until a new hire can be made by this summer.With as many as 20 to 30 interviews required in an investigation, Title IX officer Emily Springston said hearings can last up to eight hours.Rial’s four-hour-long hearing began Jan. 16 with a reading of the Indiana Promise.“I will be ethical in my academic work,” the promise reads. “I will take personal responsibility for what I say and what I do. I will respect the dignity of others, treating them with civility and understanding.”“If you sexually assault someone, you’re breaking that promise,” Rial said in an interview with the IDS.Rial said she reported the assault right after it occurred. After waiting seven hours to complete a sexual assault examination at IU Health Bloomington Hospital that night, Rial filed reports with the IU Police Department and Office of Student Ethics.In her first meeting with the office, Rial said she was given a student advocate to assist in her case and a no contact order. But she continued to see her attacker on campus.“Seeing him on campus was uncomfortable and stressful,” Rial said. “There was nothing I could do.”Upon checking with the Maurer School of Law, Rial said she learned a meeting was never arranged to file a no contact order.Shaken by post-traumatic stress disorder, Rial dropped out of classes at IU-Bloomington, where she said she felt unsafe and uncared for, and returned home to take classes at IU-South Bend.It was in South Bend that Rial skyped in to her hearing with the Office of Student Ethics. Rial said 30 witnesses supported her at the hearing and argued consent could not be given the night of the assault because she had been drinking.However, Rial was not allowed to keep a copy of her case file with her during the hearing, which she said she felt disadvantaged her.Students are not allowed to keep their own copies of case files but are given access upon request, Goldsmith said.After learning of Casares’ resignation, Rial sought an appeal with the Office of Student Ethics but was denied.She had missed the appeal deadline by three days.She then contacted Springston, who told Rial in an email her case would be one of the 18 hearings reviewed by IU after the allegations were raised against Casares.Rial said she was told her case would be one of the first to be reviewed, yet she said she has heard nothing since her initial email to Springston in the middle of February.Goldsmith said the investigation of the 18 hearings would not be a reopening of cases, nor would any of the hearings’ complainants or defendants be interviewed.“It’s just looking at those cases to see if there’s anything that looks out of the ordinary or looks like it would need to be further investigated, as opposed to rehearing all of the original cases with all of the attended facts and issues,” Goldsmith said.When Casares was hired to replace retiring Associate Dean of Students Pam Freeman in 2011, Goldsmith said Casares “presented a very good profile of someone who does this work.”Aside from attending annual week-long workshops Springston described as intensive, she said no other training is required of those hearing sexual misconduct cases.While Casares did not sit on her 2012 hearing board, Senior Sara Hutson said every year at SlutWalk Bloomington, which addresses the perception of sexuality, she writes Casares’ name on a poster.Her case will not be reviewed. Hutson said she believes Casares has a history of asking victim-blaming questions in hearings.“I’ve heard time and time again that he has been super rude and not understanding,” Hutson said.A survivor of stalking, voyeurism and unwanted touching, Hutson said reporting options were not clearly explained at the beginning of her case and she was told reporting only through the Office of Student Ethics would be easiest.“I definitely felt like the way it was presented was a little bit coercive, like a little bit skewed toward ‘we-want to-keep-this-an-internal-IU thing,’” Hutson said.She said because stalking and voyeurism were not mentioned in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Conduct at the time of her case, the board focused on the repeated attempts her attacker made to grab her and bite her neck on their shared floor and in the sink rooms in McNutt Quad.Although the male student was found responsible for what the hearing board called “unwanted sexual contact,” Hutson said her attacker only spent one of two semesters’ suspension off-campus and repeatedly violated a no contact order.A lack of communication between IUPD and the Office of Student Ethics led her no contact order to be unenforceable, she said.“My trust in the IU Office of Student Ethics is basically trashed,” Hutson said. “It’s not there anymore.”This story has been updated to reflect the distinction between \"no contact\" and \"protective\" orders. University spokesperson Mark Land said the University has no authority to issue protective orders, but can offer no contact orders through its disciplinary system.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A federal Title IX complaint with the U.S. Department of Education has been filed against IU this week, according to a press release from the national survivor advocacy group End Rape on Campus.The complaint, filed by IU freshman Hailey Rial, comes following the resignation of IU’s former director of the Office of Student Ethics Jason Casares.Rial said in an interview Monday she felt IU’s Office of Student Ethics failed her.“They put in the most minimal amount of effort that they possibly could,” Rial said. “This is supposed to be a process that is both quick and efficient and fair, and I don’t think it was quick, efficient or fair.\"Casares sat on Rial’s hearing board panel in January, just before sexual assault allegations raised by fellow Association for Student Conduct Administration conference attendee Jill Creighton prompted an investigation of 18 sexual assault hearing panels attended by Casares for the 2015 school year.Rial said despite having Casares involved in her sexual assault hearing, she was denied an appeal of her case because she was told by the University her request came three days after the appeal deadline.“I would think that the Title IX coordinator being accused of doing the same thing that someone else did to me was a bias,” Rial wrote in her Title IX complaint. “But Indiana University apparently did not agree.”Rial’s complaint is one of four complaints that have been filed this week. The others were at American University, the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Monmouth University.Both the complaints for IU and the University of Alabama at Birmingham claim forensic sexual assault examinations, or “rape kits,” were not used in either university’s investigation.In all four cases, no-contact orders went unenforced and university investigations lasted “significantly longer” than the U.S. Department of Education’s 60 day recommendation, according to the release.“Ultimately, all of the survivors’ perpetrators were either found not responsible or were given minimal sanctions, creating a hostile environmental for the survivors and severely compromising their educational experiences,” the release stated.IU is in its third year of a compliance review conducted by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights.Emily Springston, IU’s chief student welfare and Title IX officer, said in an interview this review is more like an audit, and it is not unusual for such an investigation to last as long as five or six years.She said she believes IU was chosen for the compliance review based on the University’s size and the OCR’s lack of an investigation in the Midwest region, headed out of Chicago.“There’s a lot of institutions who are in the same boat,” Springston said. “We don’t take it personally. We take it extremely seriously, but we kind of just got the luck of the draw.”Springston said her office immediately alerted the OCR when allegations involving Casares began to circulate.“They’ve never raised something of concern that would suggest that this was coming or that they had grave concerns about his role,” Springston said.IU spokesperson Mark Land said in a statement that the University is aware of the complaint filed.\"While the University cannot comment on the specifics of an individual case due to the privacy rights afforded to all parties in an investigation, it does dispute a number of the assertions made in the media as they relate to this investigation,\" Land said in the statement.Land confirmed Rial\\'s case is among the 18 cases being reviewed. \"Indiana University has a comprehensive Sexual Misconduct Policy and a robust set of practices, including the prompt provision of interim measures to complainants, that are consistent with guidelines set forth by the Office of Civil Rights,\" Land said in the statement. \"The University believes those practices were followed in this case.\"',\n",

       "  'body': 'Bloomington senior police officer William Abram was awarded Friday with the Congressional Badge of Bravery for risking his life while responding to a home invasion and sexual assault of two IU students in November 2014.This is the first time a Bloomington Police Department officer has received the national award, and it is only the second time for an officer from Indiana.Established in 2008, the Law Enforcement Congressional Badge of Bravery honors remarkable acts of courage in the line of duty by federal, state and local law enforcement officers.Senators Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Dan Coats, R-Ind., attended the award ceremony Friday at City Hall, along with U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Indiana Josh Minkler, Bloomington mayor John Hamilton and BPD Chief Mike Diekhoff.On Nov. 9, 2014, Abram responded to a 4:30 a.m. call regarding a possible sexual assault in progress. When he entered the Bloomington apartment, he saw a man inside pulling on his pants, and backed away from the doorway. A shot was fired in his direction from inside the apartment and once he stepped inside, he was fired at a second time, but not wounded.As the two men attempted to escape through a window, Abram ordered them to put their hands up. They turned and fired at him again.Abram then fired two rounds in return, hitting one of them in the leg and the other in the arm. Both suspects were taken into custody shortly after with the help of assisting officers. Abram immediately began to administer first aid to one of the suspect’s gunshot wounds while waiting for other medical responders to arrive.Officials later determined that the men had forced entry into the apartment where two female IU students lived, raping them at gunpoint before Abram arrived.In Friday’s ceremony, Donnelly called Abram’s performance that night an “extraordinary act of courage.”“On behalf of our entire state we want to thank you for saving these girls’ lives, for protecting the people of Bloomington and for protecting all of us,” Donnelly said.Donnelly also commended Abram’s wife, Suzie, and their four children for their bravery when they received the call that Abram was going to be a bit late that night.“When they go off to duty that day you expect them to come home but there’s never any guarantees,” Donnelly said.Three days after Abram put a stop to the home invasion, his wife gave birth to their youngest son, Abram said after accepting his award.“I really appreciate how it was all handled,” Abram said, thanking his family and the BPD personnel who helped in the process of responding to the call that night.“Every day we obviously think and worry about the females that were in that house,” Abram said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with them.”Diekhoff said Abram’s award is a big deal for the entire department and city, and he was proud of the way Abram took control of the situation that night.“He was just extremely professional,” Diekhoff said. “He did everything he should have done.”Coats said Abram’s award was a great tribute to the department’s training and shed positive light on the role of police officers in the community.“There’s been a lot of back and forth politically, unfortunately, relative to our law enforcement officials,” Coats said. “You are setting examples that all of us can follow.”The suspects arrested for the November 2014 home invasion, Michael W.L. Deweese and Vaylen Keishaun Glazebrook, are both charged with 15 felonies: attempted murder, seven counts of rape, two counts of armed robbery, burglary while armed, three counts of criminal confinement with injury and resisting law enforcement with a deadly weapon.The sentencing hearing for Deweese is set for April 19 and a pretrial hearing for Glazebrook is scheduled for March 31.

       "  'body': 'One in 5 women in college will be sexually assaulted. That’s the woman next to you in your sociology class. That is 5 to 10 of the women in your sorority or 50 to 100 of the women in your graduating class.There’s a reason this statistic has been the cause for comparing college campuses to a hunting ground.Colleges have been allowing women on college campuses to become objects of prey, thereby breeding a hunting ground by not having strict punishment and covering up sexual assaults.I make these accusations on the basis of the documentary film, “The Hunting Ground.” The film reveals, “an endemic system of institutional cover-ups, rationalizations, victim-blaming and denial that creates perfect storm conditions for predators to prey with impunity,” according to thehuntinggroundfilm.com.As I sat and watched “The Hunting Ground,” I couldn’t help but become enraged by the victims’ stories and the universities that did everything to cover their stories up. It absolutely infuriated me.Erica Kinsman’s story in particular stood out to me. She was a student at Florida State University at the time of her assault on December 7, 2012.“There was virtually no investigation at all, either by the police or the university” for Kinsman’s case, according to The New York Times.I was able to see the amount of time and effort that took place in her investigation from a timeline shown in “The Hunting Ground.” From the day she reported the rape, committed by a Florida State University student and football player Jameis Winston, it took nearly two years for a hearing — which took place December 2014.On December 21, 2014, Winston was found not responsible for raping Kinsman, despite the DNA found on her clothing matching Winston’s and his violation of FSU’s student policy that requires verbal consent of sexual encounters.The systemic effort that went against Kinsman in her pursuit of justice against her rapist for her assault is what enrages me the most.Not only was she initially instructed to “think twice” before filing a report upon meeting with Tallahassee police officer Scott Angulo, but she was later told, “this is a huge football town.You really should think long and hard if you want to press charges,” as well, as reported by the Washington Post.The police then did nothing for 10 months. Once they did act, she received death threats and was forced to drop out of school due to the hatred she received from her accusations against FSU’s star-freshman quarterback.The story of Erica Kinsman not only shows the precedence that a college’s reputation and its college athletes hold over the lives of sexual assault victims, but how meaningless the victims lives truly are to these colleges.And the scary fact is that her case is only one of many across the US.But all hope isn’t lost. “The Hunting Ground” has revealed the discrepancies of universities and highlighted the way for survivors to take back their lives and get justice through Title IX legal strategies. The film has also provoked new changes in laws in New York and California.What you and I can do to evoke change in the way universities handle these cases is making sure they know we won’t stand for it.I honestly don’t get their logic behind silencing the victims of sexual assault and freeing their assailants so as not to tarnish their reputation. What is tarnishing their reputation is their complete lack of morality and justice regarding human life.We need to let them know that their skewed logic won’t be tolerated, and keep fighting for more change.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A new bill called the Sexual Assault Survivor’s Rights Act has been introduced into the Senate and will standardize the rights of sexual assault victims. The system for pressing charges of sexual assault is convoluted, making prosecution extremely difficult for victims.Hopefully, this bill will begin to provide an easier and less emotionally damaging process for sexual assault victims to receive justice.Currently, states have various systems of cataloguing and testing rape kits, but this bill will standardize those systems. It will allow survivors to know where their rape kit is at all times, whether it has been tested and what the results of that test are.This is incredibly important for sexual assault survivors who decide to press charges.Not every survivor decides to press charges right away, as a trial is often a harrowing and emotionally traumatic experience. Investigations into sexual assault cases have been known to devolve into discussions of what the victim was wearing at the time and other unhelpful and victim-blaming inqueries, therefore a lot of survivors choose not to prosecute.Despite the importance of these kits, many police departments have mishandled this evidence. According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, there is a backlog of rape kit tests that are backlogged because tests are never sent to the lab, or the lab never tested it.In November, the Guardian reported on rape kit procedure and this backlog, finding that police departments would destroy rape kits if “they deemed allegations unfounded, alleged that victims didn’t cooperate or arrested suspects without the benefit of DNA.”If a survivor decides to press charges, the rape kit is integral to his or her case. Not only does a rape kit attempt to use DNA to identify the attacker, but it also is usually the only physical evidence available to show that a crime was committed.This bill will standardize the procedures and will allow victims to keep track of their rape kits. This standardization will greatly ease their struggle to press charges.This bill will also require that victims have access to sexual assault counselors and are educated about their legal options.The Sexual Assault Survivors Rights Act will also implement a task force to observe the changes made and their effectiveness. This bill is a huge step for rights for sexual assault survivors.For a long time, the system has been broken for sexual assault survivors, extending the trauma of the crime committed against them. Hopefully now, we are one step closer to giving these survivors justice.Jordrile@indiana.edu@RiledUpIDs',\n",

       "  'body': 'After seeing the number of passionate students in last year’s election, sophomores Naomi Kellogg and Nate Meyers said they knew they needed to run for office as soon as possible.When it came time for this year’s election, Kellogg and Meyers decided to start their campaign, RISE for IU Student Association.Juniors Chesley Swann and Kyle Messer joined Kellogg and Meyers for a campaign with the slogan “Friends first, Leaders second.”Kellogg is the ticket’s presidential candidate with Meyers as the vice president of congress, Swann as vice president of administration and Messer as treasurer.POLICIESRISE is an acronym that stands for their policies of reach, inclusion, safety and experience.REACHRISE wants to create a culture that takes what previous administrations have done and builds on it the following year.Though they also have their own initiatives, RISE plans to look at initiatives already in place and see how they can continue implementing them, Kellogg said.“We want to take that work, build on it and then bring our new ideas to the table,” Kellogg said.Another aspect of reach is helping other student organizations become more successful.Helping every organization use the resources the University offers is important to helping them achieve their goals for the year, Swann said.INCLUSIONKellogg said RISE has set a large focus on making their ticket as inclusive as possible, reaching out to people who might not have otherwise been involved in student government.However, inclusion extends beyond just their ticket, Kellogg said.RISE is working towards creating a more inclusive campus as well.“We may come from different backgrounds, but we all have this common goal in mind, to really be successful here at IU,” Swann said.Working on policy for the international community, freshman Joseph Cullather focuses on going directly to international students and asking about their needs.Cullather has reached out to culture centers and had round table discussions with them about issues they face.“Building the policy platform from the ground up, directly from what the students want, is all about inclusion,” Cullather said.SAFETYTo create a safe environment on campus, RISE is focusing on two key initiatives: increased sexual assault prevention and increased lighting on campus.Junior Dylan Lanoff is in charge of sexual assault policy. Her goal is to target this problem from the core and teach students about sexual assault as soon as they enter the University.Ways to change the current sexual assault culture are increasing consent education, bystander intervention training and sexual health training.“We’re really trying to change that culture before it really begins,” Lanoff said.To improve lighting on campus, RISE’s plan includes doing a quality audit of lighting on campus. Kellogg said the amount of lighting changes depending on the location.“Not all lighting is created equal,” Kellogg said.EXPERIENCECreating a memorable college experience for all students is another focus of RISE’s campaign. The ticket wants to focus on connecting with the Bloomington community, not just those on the University campus.A policy Meyers said he is excited about is starting a local business fair on campus. With a wealth of local business in Bloomington, having a fair could be mutually beneficial for both students and businesses, he said.“There’s often a disconnect between the small businesses and the student body,” Meyers said.Another plan to improve the college experience is having tabling days for student organizations with philanthropic ties. This allows these organizations to be more connected to the students and the community, Kellogg said.For example, an organization such as the Crimson Cupboard, which educates students on food insecurity, could set up a table outside of a c-store. Students could then use their meal points to donate food or supplies to the cupboard.“It allows students to see that we really are there for them and we are advocating for them every single day,” Kellogg said.Another way to improve the experience on campus is through increasing sustainability on campus.Junior Steven Aranyi has made this policy his focus.“There’s clearly ridiculous untapped potential on this campus and off campus,” Aranyi said.RISE is focusing on little behavioral changes on campus, such as increasing recycling or adding energy stickers on every light switch.“On a campus of over 40,000, it’s those little changes that really have a big impact on our environment,” Meyers said.NEXT STEPSAs it continues to build its policy and team, RISE will continue to bring in new people and hear their perspectives on campus issues.“We’re really focused on reaching those student leaders that have so much passion and so much care for what’s going on,” Kellogg said.Kellogg said a lot of ideas IUSA tries to implement are already being done on a smaller scale within other organizations on campus.It’s important to tap into that potential to get things done on a larger scale, Kellogg said.Making promises they can keep is a priority for every member of RISE. All policies they make must be feasible, Kellogg said.Kellogg said the campaign or winning doesn’t matter if nothing gets done in office.“It is all worthless if you don’t get things done,” Kellogg said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'IU is on a list of 165 postsecondary institutions that have pending Title IX sexual violence investigations, conducted by the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education.According to the document, the Bloomington campus has two current cases. One was opened in March 2014, and the other in June 2015.The list, updated weekly and available upon request, consists of cases that were either opened due to compliance reviews or outside complaints. The DOE cannot disclose any specific information regarding the IU investigations.“OCR is a law enforcement agency,” DOE Press Officer Jim Bradshaw said. “And like most law enforcement organizations, it doesn’t discuss the details of ongoing investigations.”In a 2014 press release, the University said they were complying with the DOE, and the process is a routine that hundreds of institutions go through regularly. Up to that point, the office confirmed it had no standing complaints regarding the Bloomington campus’s procedures on sexual assault.The investigations involve IU giving data, reports of sexual assault and details of their procedures to the DOE. The department said it then uses its results to guide the University in updating their policies.The University said the Office of Student Welfare and Title IX takes the findings of the investigation seriously, and they use the results to reform current procedures, as well as begin new initiatives to prevent sexual assault and provide help to survivors.At IU, the Office of Student Welfare and Title IX works University-wide with multiple offices to meet its goals of investigation, prevention and guidance for sexual assault victims.“In my role, I work with all campuses on our response and prevention to sexual misconduct, in guiding and coordinating our efforts, and overseeing compliance with Title IX, VAWA (Violence Against Women Act) and IU policy,” said Emily Springston, IU chief student welfare and Title IX officer.The office practices have come into question since deputy Title IX director Jason Casares was accused of sexual assault.Casares, who sat on panels to hear sexual assault cases, was put on paid administrative leave after Jill Creighton, a New York University assistant director for global community standards, said he took advantage of her at an Association for Student Conduct Administration conference last December.IU is currently overseeing the review of the last 18 sexual assault cases Casares participated in.The DOE cannot disclose case-specific details on what prompted their standing investigations against the University in 2014 and 2015, both prior to the accusations against Casares. However, IU responded to their federal guidance in 2014 by making changes to several procedures, such as removing students from appeals hearings for sexual assault cases.Springston said the Title IX office uses data from surveys, investigations and their own annual reports to guide the current objectives and improvements of the University regarding sexual assault policy.“We do take results from reports on our work very seriously,” Springston said. “We are very much focused on supporting students and helping them succeed at IU.”',\n",

George Connolly said. The case remains active.Capt. Steve Kellams said he has reason to believe the people involved in the sexual assault were IU students.The woman told police she had invited a group of friends over to her house on Friday night, beginning at about 7:30 p.m. The friends were playing a drinking game that involved removing clothing when a player lost, Connolly said.The woman became extremely drunk and went upstairs to a bedroom and was followed by one of the male guests, who was about the same age as her. They curled up in bed, and he began touching her, Connolly said.She didn’t immediately object because of her intoxication level, Connolly said.“She feels she was too drunk to have said no,” Connolly said.She objected soon after, and the man left the room, went downstairs and slept on the couch for the rest of the night.The woman reported the sexual assault to the BPD at about 4:30 p.m. Monday.Samantha Schmidt',\n",

       "  'body': 'Kesha was once one of the world’s most successful pop artists. But she hasn’t released music since 2012 due to ongoing litigation against her producer and accused abuser, Lukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald.The struggle between Kesha and her producer puts the spotlight on music industry giants in the background that aren’t held accountable for the industry’s corruption.Hopefully Kesha’s story will allow even more stars to come forward and begin to battle the misogynistic and dangerous culture of the music industry.In October, Kesha filed a civil suit against Gottwald that he emotionally, physically and sexually abused her in their almost 10-year relationship.The Manhattan Supreme Court ruled against releasing Kesha from her contract with Kemosabe Records, owned by Sony Music Entertainment.Gottwald discovered the pop star when she was 18.According to Kesha’s filed suit, Gottwald convinced her to drop out of high school and move to Los Angeles.A 2013 New Yorker profile of Gottwald explains why he signed Kesha: “But to have real control — to be more than the appetizer-maker to the queen — Dr. Luke needs to discover and develop his own superstars, so that he can participate in every aspect of their career. That’s what he hoped to do with Kesha.”Disney is constantly under fire for the same controlling behavior as it has proven to produce mental and physical risks for the young girls trying to escape from it.Kesha’s lawsuit details sexual assault and manipulation: date rape, verbal abuse Kesha feels resulted in her bulimia nervosa and threats.The suit also claims Kesha has been denied “any meaningful profit from her work due to Dr. Luke’s exploitation of her over the last decade” because Gottwald refused to negotiate her contract beyond the one-sided contract she signed at 18.Producing more albums with her abuser and unable to make a living, Kesha would be emotionally attacked with a destroyed career.This litigation has cost Kesha six years in an industry in which youth is part of the product. Gottwald filed a defamation countersuit that Kesha has made false allegations.But if it is a business move, it’s an incredibly unwise one.As her lawyer claimed in court Friday, “Her brand value has fallen ... Kesha will suffer irreparable harm, plummeting her career past the point of no return.”Sony should never have let it get this far. Gottwald has produced hits with Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson and Miley Cyrus, none of whom still work with him.Sony refused to let Kesha go since Kesha makes money, which forced her to remain in an abusive situation.This ambition and ambivalence for exploited young stars remain trademarks of the music industry. Think Marylin Monroe, think Britney Spears. It is unacceptable, and it must stop, starting with #FreeKesha.jordrile@indiana.edu@RiledupIDS',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Office of Student Welfare and Title IX is streamlining its student outreach initiatives to prevent sexual assault, provide help for survivors and eliminate confusion.Emily Springston, chief student welfare and Title IX officer, said one of the major problems the office has faced is understanding what students are hearing about sexual assault.“Some students want us to provide them with detailed texts, some prefer social media outreach, and others we have yet to discover how we can resonate with them,” Springston said. “It’s different for every individual.”Mistrust from students, is a natural reaction for such a sensitive topic as sexual assault, she said. Especially with the recent accusations against Jason Casares, associate dean of students and deputy Title IX coordinator, she said she wants to make sure the process makes sense to everyone involved.Casares was accused of sexual misconduct by Jill Creighton, an assistant director for global community standards at New York University. He has been placed on paid administrative leave by the University.The University has requested the review of the last 18 sexual assault case hearings Casares oversaw. IU spokesperson Mark Land said the reviews began earlier this week, though the specifics of each case are confidential to protect the privacy of those involved.The Department of Education conducted an investigation on the University’s Title IX policies in 2014. However, they are unable to reveal the details of its investigations to the public.A major part of discussing sexual assault is figuring out a way to give students important information so they can understand how IU processes cases and provides help, Springston said.Recently, the office has expanded their web presence and created brochures to clear up the meaning of complicated terminology.Title IX is a law that prevents sexual discrimination in educational institutions. The office, which falls under the Dean of Students Office, conducts reports and provides services to address specific legal issues, primarily sexual misconduct.In the fall of 2014, the Office of Student Welfare and Title IX sent out a sexual assault climate survey, which received a response from 17 percent of the student population.In order to advance the goals of the Student Welfare Initiative, which seeks to maximize efforts of preventing and responding to sexual assault, the office also released its annual report for the 2014-15 school year.“The data of our cases, the individual feedback we have received and the climate survey, supports what we have already observed,” Springston said. “We are also able to use it to plan future initiatives.”During the past two years, Springston said the office has responded by heightening the levels of employee training.Leslie Fasone, assistant dean of students of women’s and gender affairs, said the staff has been using reports to guide the formation of a sexual violence prevention committee, as well as a task force that meets monthly to provide feedback and recommendations.Fasone said the office has recently piloted a new workshop on alcohol, consent and bystander intervention. It also plans to initiate a prevention campaign this fall.“Both of these recommendations have come from student leaders over the last year,” Fasone said. “In addition to our partnerships with students, we have been collaborating with a number of different departments at IU to enhance our reach to various groups of students.”Springston said she has plans to look at the sexual misconduct policy this summer, with the intent to focus primarily on education and training in order to fix and clarify several provisions. Despite the office’s efforts, Springston said students are rightfully worried about the pending Casares case.“The message that we care and support our students is always the same,” Springston said. “Although we still have individual cases we have to go through, and a strict process that must be followed.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Should rapists be granted custody of children they father through rape?The New Mexico House of Representatives unanimously said no, voting 58-0 on Feb. 12 to allow a mother to revoke the parental rights of her child’s biological father if he has been convicted of raping the mother.New Mexico State Rep. Conrad James, R-24th District, the sponsor of House Bill 50, said the bill “protects mothers and their children from suffering continued harm after a sexual assault” and “offers a measure of compassion by allowing survivors of rape to sever all ties with the person who assaulted them.”A similar bill, also sponsored by James, previously died in the New Mexico State Senate.While this bill is undoubtedly an excellent step in the right direction, the requirement of a rape conviction means that too many mothers and their children will fall through the legislative cracks.According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN), only 46 of every 100 rapes are ever reported to police, and only five out of 100 lead to a felony conviction.This means 95 percent of rape cases result in no conviction, leaving a huge number of families at risk of being forced by the courts to have continued contact with people who raped and traumatized them.Unfortunately, it isn’t only in cases of children fathered through rape that mothers and their children are forced into such continued harmful contact.Domestic abusers are too often able to manipulate judges, lawyers and other people so they can continue having contact with their children, which poses immense dangers to the children.According to the American Bar Association, abusive parents are more likely to seek sole custody than non-abusive parents, and they are granted sole custody about 70 percent of the time.The ABA also cites research showing domestic violence against a parent is “a strong predictor of child abuse.”According to domestic violence expert Lundy Bancroft, the risk of child abuse by abusive individuals “appears to increase rather than decrease when the couple separates.”Our courts are failing to protect children by continuing to force them to have contact with dangerous abusers.Protecting children and their mothers from convicted rapists is not enough.Law enforcement and the courts must become better at identifying, understanding and convicting both rape and domestic abuse offenders, but even this is not enough.Our courts and everyone who works in them must be better educated about domestic abuse, who perpetrates it, how they perpetrate it and why.Our legal and justice systems must also involve domestic abuse experts, victims and survivors in policy making to a much greater degree than they do now.Unless this happens, courts will continue to hand over helpless children to dangerous abusers.No one who has been assaulted, abused or traumatized should be forced to continue seeing their abuser or assailant — especially not children.woodsmj@indiana.edu@miriamjwoods',\n",

Andy Stephenson said.The student was intoxicated and taken into custody. Once at jail, she reported the sexual assault to IUPD, but could not remember any specific details, Stephenson said. She was then transferred to the hospital. No suspect has been identified.Jeanie Van Meter, house director for Kappa Alpha Theta, said the female student was not a member of the sorority and that sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta went out of their way to assist the female student.In a second incident, a female student reported at 4:25 a.m. Sunday she had been raped after accepting a ride in a car from three men she met that night, Stephenson said.She reported the rape occurred in the vehicle. The three suspects claim the sexual activity was consensual, Stephenson said. IUPD believes alcohol was involved.Tracy James, assurance communications manager for IU Public Safety and Institutional Assurance, said in an email the men in the car were not students and only one suspect has been identified.No charges have been filed yet and the incident is still under investigation.In a third incident reported to IUPD, a man made a third-party complaint of the rape of a female student, James said in the email.The report was made at 2:09 a.m. Sunday after the man overheard a conversation in which the student said she had been raped, Stephenson said. The victim was allegedly assaulted months ago, Stephenson said. The victim did not wish to speak to the police and there is no active investigation.A fourth incident of rape was reported as occurring at 2:06 a.m. Sunday. The reported rape occurred off-campus, James said in the email.Bloomington Police Department handled the case and did not comment.Sarah GardnerIn a previous version of this story, it was said the three men in the car in the second incidence of rape reported were students and suspects in the case. Only one suspect has been named and the men in the car were not students. It was also said in the previous article that a female student made a third-party complaint of the rape of a female student. The person who made this complaint is a man who is not a student. In the fourth reported incident, a previous version of this story said the reported rape occurred in McNutt Quadrangle.

       "  'body': 'Sexual assault survivor Lauren Devereux said many students don’t trust the services offered to victims and they’re too afraid to approach someone for help.She said this problem will only worsen with the sexual assault accusation against Jason Casares, associate dean of students and deputy Title IX coordinator.“If I were going through the process now, I would feel unsafe to approach the Office of Student Ethics,” Devereux said. “It’s almost as though the assailant is sitting on your panel when you’re trying to get help to escape what he did to you.”When senior Rachel Haddad was sexually assaulted, she said she was also initially hesitant to seek help from the University.After hearing about the alleged sexual assault by Jason Casares, who oversaw a portion of her case, Haddad said she would have felt even less inclined to seek guidance if this had happened earlier.Casares was in charge of Haddad’s appeals hearing. He was recently placed on paid administrative leave after being accused of sexual assault by Jill Creighton, an assistant director for global community standards at New York University.“We are taking an independent look at all the sexual misconduct cases for this academic year that have gone to the disciplinary hearing panel that Jason Casares chaired just to ensure that they were handled appropriately,” IU spokesperson Mark Land said.Although Land said he couldn’t offer specifics on the reviews, he estimated the number of cases under review falls between 15 and 20 investigations.Haddad said she feels the Casares case is not the only problem students should worry about. She said the campus should do a better job of making its services accessible and work to change the culture on campus surrounding sexual assault.“I went to the Sexual Assault Crisis Service because I was traumatized,” Haddad said. “The lady who spoke to me told me about the hearings done by the Office of Student Ethics, which I hadn’t heard about before, and I filed for one before Christmas break.”Although there was no police evidence, Haddad was told she could still go through the hearings process and receive help. She approached the Student Advocates Office, which connects individuals with support services, confidential advocates and a step-by-step guiding process through the IU judicial system.“I felt like I was treated respectfully throughout the process and that the officers helping me were concerned about my well-being,” Haddad said. “Going through the trial was an ordeal, however.”Before a date was set, Haddad provided every detail of the occurrence in paper format and confronted her assailant until he agreed to share his side of the story. The trial took place on a weekend, and it took the entire day.Haddad’s assailant was found guilty, and he filed to go through the appeals process. The original findings of the trial were upheld, and he was put on a year’s suspension from the University.“It was quicker than the original trial, but it was almost more stressful,” Haddad said. “I know they needed to be thorough, but it was frustrating to hear them ask about intimate details multiple times. What was the point of bringing up the same sensitive detail to me six times?”As a member of greek life and a female student at IU, one of the main reasons she said she didn’t approach someone sooner was because she was afraid of being judged.“These girls who ask for help are human. They’re not just dumb sluts,” Haddad said. “You don’t understand how much they go through when they go to therapy, go through these trials and receive so much backlash for supposedly being selfish and desperate for attention.”Devereux, a recent IU graduate, went through a similar situation with her sexual assault case, but she said she chose not to attend the hearings.“I wrote a long statement that was read at the panel that detailed what I went through the night I was violated,” Devereux said. “Even though I didn’t go, a lot of my friends went as witnesses, and they left the hearing in tears.”Devereux said she didn’t have many problems with the Office of Student Ethics throughout her case because the investigation was both neutral and respectful.She said her faith in the system was damaged by how they treated her friends.“I heard from two or three of my friends that they spoke to them in an accusatory manner during the hearings,” Devereux said. “They were harshly interrogated, and were treated as though they were guilty, which is a serious problem in my eyes.”Devereux said the problematic culture of sexual assault on campus, combined with recent administrative issues, may only worsen these sentiments.“If these allegations are true, it makes me even more wary of our campus’s efforts to fight sexual assault,” Haddad said. “You would think he’s one of the good guys, but this would make the office lose so much credibility.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"Michael Rezendes and Sacha Pfeiffer, journalists recently depicted in the Oscar-nominated film “Spotlight,” spoke to Media School students Monday about their experiences in journalism.Pfeiffer and Rezendes, along with other journalists on the Boston Globe’s Spotlight team, uncovered a series of child molestation scandals within Boston-area Catholic churches in 2002, which ultimately led to a major investigation and international reform within the Catholic Church.“This was the worst kept secret in town, maybe in the country, maybe in the world,” Rezendes said.In the film adaptation of their reporting, Pfeiffer and Rezendes were portrayed by Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo, respectively.Through the investigation, the number of Boston clergymen participating in the sexual assault rose from 13 clergymen to about 9.The coverage caused massive controversy for the Catholic Church, and the Church is still facing problems with molestation to this day.Rezendes said he wanted to emphasize to the attendees of the event that the Boston Globe wasn’t the first tdiscover the connection between the Church and sexual abuse, but it did expose the cover-up that kept it out of public eye.Rezendes compared the investigation of the scandal by the Spotlight team of reporters to the investigation of Watergate thirty years earlier.Since the team’s coverage coincided with the popularization of the Interne, Rezendes said the story was “the first major journalism investigation to ever go viral.”Pfeiffer and Rezendes also gave advice to the media students attending the lecture about what they can do when entering careers in journalism.The reporters opened this part of the discussion by mentioning the pros and cons of being a reporter.“One of the things I love about being a reporter is having access to people and places that you wouldn’t have access to otherwise,” Pfeiffer said.Pfeiffer emphasized that access depends on a reporter’s skills. A journalist must be persistent and able to get the source out of their comfort zones.Rezendes described the bond trust between a source and a reporter as a “romance.”“I've got to marry a source,” he said. “I need to get them to trust me.”The downside to journalism currently is the explosion of the Internet-based media, and how it significantly reduces the number of paying subscribers, Pfeiffer said.In order to support journalism today, she said she encourages others to subscribe to various media outlets.While journalists are encouraged to be objective in their reporting, Rezendes said emotional attachment to certain stories is inevitable. However, he urged reporters to balance their empathy with unbiased reporting.The knowledge and stories shared by the speakers was enlightening for aspiring journalists.“It’s really eye-opening,” said freshman John Padric Adams. “It really makes you want to go out and change the world like they have.”While he said he is a fan of the movie, Professor of Practice Tom French said he wants students to remember it is only a Hollywood adaptation and Rezendes and Pfeiffer are the real stars.“They wouldn’t have a goddamn story if it wasn’t for the real extraordinary story these reporters covered,” he said\",\n",

       "  'body': 'IU will conduct a review of fewer than 20 sexual assault hearings dating back to the beginning of the school year following accusations that Jason Casares, IU associate dean of students, sexually assaulted a colleague at an Association for Student Conduct Administration conference in December, according to IU spokesperson Mark Land.Casares, who also serves as the University’s Title IX director, sat on a three-member panel that reviews IU students’ reports of sexual misconduct in the hearing stage.Casares was hired in 2011 as the associate dean of students and director of student ethics, according to a 2011 IU press release.Before coming to IU, Casares worked as an assistant dean of students at the University of Arizona.He has since been placed on paid administrative leave while the University investigates the allegations, which came last week via an open letter posted on Twitter by Jill Creighton, an assistant director for global community standards at New York University.“The University found out about this Wednesday evening when the accuser’s letter to her fellow members of the Association for Student Conduct Administration became public,” Land said in an email. “He has been placed on paid administrative leave by the University while we investigate the claims made against him.”Creighton tweeted the letter after learning Casares would be allowed to attend an ASCA conference last week in St. Petersburg, Florida.In her letter, Creighton said Casares, the former ASCA president-elect, took advantage of her after she had too much to drink at the December convention in Fort Worth, Texas.Creighton, claiming she felt unsafe in the ASCA, said she then filed a criminal complaint with police in Texas.Fort Worth Police Department officer Daniel Segura confirmed a sexual assault investigation case is open in the department, and contact was made with Creighton at around 9:30 p.m. Dec. 9, 2015.“I also could not stand the hypocrisy of Jason parading his expertise on Title IX, knowing how he had behaved with me,” Creighton said in the letter. “When I knew it could blow up in my face and that I had nothing to gain but my own sense of safety, I asked ASCA to impeach Jason.”In the letter, Creighton said although she was asked to maintain confidentiality about impeachment hearings related to Creighton’s formal complaint, Casares had resigned from his position as ASCA president-elect after being given the option of resignation during impeachment hearings.“For those of you who will doubt me or be swayed by Jason’s implausible stories to explain myself, I did not consent to sexual contact with Jason,” Creighton said in the letterIn a statement from Casares’ lawyer, Tony Paganelli, Casares denied “false accusations of sexual misconduct,” made by Creighton.“Ms. Creighton has made inappropriate and false public statements reasserting her claims against Mr. Casares over social media and in person to the attendees at an ASCA conference this week in Florida,” Paganelli said in the statement.On Thursday, the ASCA Board of Directors responded in a letter to its members confirming that the ASCA received a formal complaint from Creighton on Dec. 10, 2015.According to the letter, the ASCA Board of Directors hired an independent investigator from Hutcheson Bowers LLLP, an Austin, Texas, law firm, to “conduct an investigation and present findings to the board.”In the letter, the ASCA board said the law firm found “Ms. Creighton’s claims could not be substantiated,” and the complaint was resolved in an executive session.According to the ASCA board letter, Casares resigned as ASCA president-elect Jan. 29, but remains an ASCA member with “the same rights as other members to attend and present at ASCA events.”“ASCA is working to accommodate the needs of both Ms. Creighton and Mr. Casares during this difficult time, taking into account safety and privacy precautions,” the board said in the letter.According to the letter, the complaint resolution has come to a close and the association is “focused on the future and moving forward.”A Twitter account named Jason Casares Fans with 20 followers tweeted a statement Friday defending Casares.“We afford students, both victims and accused the right to a fair process and the expectation of impartial investigation and presumption of innocence,” supporters of Casares said in a statement. “What is also fact is the majority of people associated with the accused has not given that right to Mr. Casares.”Supporters of Creighton also released a statement Friday that detailed facts believed to be true of the case and defending Creighton’s choice to speak out.“She has risked her job, her career and her professional reputation to speak the truth,” the supporters said in the release. “She has no reason to make these allegations other than because they are true.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Trial by Twitter isn\\'t justiceJason Casares, the IU associate dean of students and sitting president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration, has been put on paid administrative leave after a public accusation of sexual assault of his colleague, Jill Creighton.If this accusation is true, it is a terrible breach of professional trust and an abhorrent and brutal crime for which he should be punished and shunned.The problem is we don’t know if it’s true or not.In fact, an independent investigator hired by the ASCA found no evidence it was true, and the Texas police have not acted on her case in any way.While nothing has been confirmed, and official authorities have found no reason to charge him with a crime, Casares is publicly vilified as a sexual criminal and forced out of the ASCA.Why did this happen? Twitter.On Feb. 3, Creighton posted her open letter to the ASCA on Twitter. She said she felt the police had ignored her and the ASCA had stonewalled her. She had nowhere else to go but the court of public opinion.This “trial by tweet” has become a growing trend in cases of sexual assault where physical evidence is nearly impossible to come by and he-said-she-said cases never make it to court.The problem with this approach is it is closer to a vigilante lynch mob than a fair criminal proceeding. It has powerful consequences for those accused, whether or not the accusations are accurate. In the United States, everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and this principle is the foundation for our justice system. On social media, it is often whoever swings first wins regardless of evidence or context.Case in point: the story of Paul Nungesser. Nungesser was accused of rape last year, and his accuser Emma Sulkowicz created a brilliant social media campaign around the story by carrying her mattress around for the rest of the year in a protest.This prompted national media coverage and millions of tweets, all of which ruined Nungesser’s life. He received death threats, his friends ostracized him and he couldn’t find a job after graduation.Later, the University wasn’t able to find enough evidence to expel Nungesser, and he is now suing Columbia University on various charges.While I support everyone’s right to free speech, we, as a society, should not encourage this social media mob mentality.We should view Twitter accusations as desperate and often unfounded cries for attention. They are deliberate attempts to circumvent our legitimate justice system where everyone is assumed innocent until proven otherwise.Casares might be guilty, but he might not. Regardless of what percentage of sexual assault accusations are false, until we see evidence in a court of law he deserves the assumption of innocence.A previous version of this article stated Nungesser sued Sulkowicz and Casares was \"out of a job\" as a result of these actions. The IDS regrets these errors.Brian AndersonWe shouldn\\'t have to question IUIU has a sexual assault problem.IU Bloomington’s Community Attitudes and Experiences with Sexual Assault Survey found that 17 percent of undergraduate women had experienced attempted or completed penetrative sexual assault while at IU. That’s one in six undergraduate women on this campus. In 2012, IU was fourth in the nation for forcible sexual assaults .Now, IU’s own title IX director, Jason Casares, president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration, has been accused of sexual assault of his colleague, Jill Creighton.College campuses in general have an unimpressive history of dealing with the sad reality of sexual assault. It is even more disturbing to know one of our coordinators is under investigation for the crime he is supposed to defend against.The press may never have all the necessary evidence to say what happened that night without reservation. This is often the case for sexual assault.We do know something happened that could be construed as sexual assault by the victim. We know Creighton was drinking and said she felt Casares took advantage of her.The court of law requires something it almost never gets in cases of sexual assault. It is because of that reality we must plan for the worst. It is IU’s job to make sure students can trust their administration.As a student on this campus and as a woman, I believe if someone is going to stand as a judge against sexual assault, there cannot be a question of their understanding of what consent is and the destruction that results from sexual assault.If I can’t expect the person making decisions about how sexual assault is treated on this campus to be clear of suspicion, then I can’t trust the University to protect me.While there is still a question of his violence towards women, he should remain suspended from his position.This question may not have ever been brought to the attention of the campus if not for Creighton coming forward on Twitter.In many cases, victims of sexual assault feel they can’t tell their story for fear of being vilified. The media’s immediate reaction often is to doubt and blame women. No one can forget the Steubenville, Ohio, case in which commentators lamented the tragedy of the young rapists’ lives being ruined.And yet, as dangerous and fickle as the court of public opinion can be, sometimes it is the only court sexual assault victims have left to turn to.At that point, it is no longer just about justice for one crime, but frequently about preventing another, as well as adding to the exhaustingly long narrative of injustice to sexual assault victims.It doesn’t matter how the question was raised, just if it is being answered.As a student on this campus, I would rather know if I can trust the people in charge of combating the serious sexual assault problem at IU. I would rather there be no question.Jordan Riley',\n",

       "  'body': 'Jason Casares, the IU associate dean of students and sitting president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration, has been put on paid administrative leave after a public accusation of sexual assault of his colleague, Jill Creighton.If this accusation is true, it is a terrible breach of professional trust and an abhorrent and brutal crime for which he should be punished and shunned.The problem is we don’t know if it’s true or not.In fact, an independent investigator hired by the ASCA found no evidence it was true, and the Texas police have not acted on her case in any way.While nothing has been confirmed, and official authorities have found no reason to charge him with a crime, Casares is publicly vilified as a sexual criminal and forced out of the ASCA.Why did this happen? Twitter.On Feb. 3, Creighton posted her open letter to the ASCA on Twitter. She said she felt the police had ignored her and the ASCA had stonewalled her. She had nowhere else to go but the court of public opinion.This “trial by tweet” has become a growing trend in cases of sexual assault where physical evidence is nearly impossible to come by and he-said-she-said cases never make it to court.The problem with this approach is it is closer to a vigilante lynch mob than a fair criminal proceeding. It has powerful consequences for those accused, whether or not the accusations are accurate. In the United States, everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and this principle is the foundation for our justice system. On social media, it is often whoever swings first wins regardless of evidence or context.Case in point: the story of Paul Nungesser.

       "  'body': 'Supporters of Association for Student Conduct Administration president-elect Jill Creighton, who has raised allegations of sexual assault by IU administrator Jason Casares, released a statement Friday afternoon.Casares, who has been placed on paid administrative leave according to IU spokesperson Mark Land, serves as associate dean of students and deputy Title IX director for IU.According to the release, Creighton texted Casares following the alleged assault at an ASCA conference in December in Fort Worth, Texas, asking he resign from the ASCA and from his involvement in Title IX leadership.“Jason did not take this option, but it would have spared him the publicity, reputational and employment implications he now faces,” supporters said in the statement.[Read our initial coverage of the allegation of sexual assault against Jason Casares]Creighton explained in text messages to Casares that she would “take the steps necessary to make herself safe,” according to the release.“When the assault happened, Jill realized she was not safe, because she would have to work with Jason on the Board of the ASCA for two more years,” supporters said in the release.The ASCA Board of Directors hired an independent investigator from the Austin, Texas, law firm Hutcheson Bowers LLLC to “conduct an investigation and present findings to the Board,” according to an ASCA statement released Thursday.The investigation found that Creighton’s claims were unsubstantiated, according to the release.Creighton is disputing what the ASCA has called a “fair and unbiased investigation for both parties.” According to the Friday release, Creighton provided police officers with texts to a third party saying Casares “was hitting on her and that she would ‘never’ sleep with him,” also confirming an account with police and a series of witnesses.Also according the Friday release, text messages sent by Casares to defend himself could not be found on his phone or on the phone of the person he claimed to have texted.“This was omitted from the investigation report, which was victim-blaming in the extreme, and failed to account for the effects of trauma in its judgment of Jill’s responses,” supporters of Creighton said in the release.As we speak on moral courage, I share mine. You voted me President-Elect, please read my open letter to you: https://t.co/17bwRuu38b #asca16Supporters claimed in the release investigators also failed to note that Casares’ initially denied Creighton having been in his room and then tried to blame a third party after changing his statement claiming that Creighton had, in fact, been in his room.Creighton was shocked to learn the ASCA found her claims unsubstantiated, according to the release.“Despite the ASCA’s claims, the investigator was not properly trained and prepared for this type of case,” supporters said in the statement. “Her work clearly showed that.”Fort Worth Police Department officer Daniel Segura confirmed this morning that a sexual assault investigation case is open in his department, and that contact was made with Creighton at around 9:30 p.m. Dec. 9, 2015.These supporters claim statements made by Casares’ lawyer, Tony Paganelli, are “misleading and false.”[An IDS investigation delving into sexual assault at IU cited Casares as a source. Read a reporter\\'s personal experience with Casares and Title IX proceedings.]Creighton has declined to follow Casares as ASCA president, according to the release.“This is important, as it speaks to motivation,” supporters said in the release. “We live in a society that questions the motives of victims who go public.”Creighton\\'s supporters said she has “everything to lose in sharing her story and being judged publically,” including possible impeachment and loss of friends and respect from colleagues.“She has risked her job, her career and her professional reputation to speak the truth,” the supporters said in the release. “She has no reason to make these allegations other than because they are true.\"Casares did not respond to an email request for comment Friday.Carley Lanich',\n",

       "  'body': 'Jason Casares, IU associate dean of students and deputy Title IX director, has been put on paid administrative leave by the University following accusations of sexual assault at an Association for Student Conduct Administration conference, according to IU spokesperson Mark Land.IU will conduct a review of all sexual misconduct hearings conducted by Casares this academic school year, Land said. In his position as deputy Title IX director, Casares sat on a three-member panel that reviews sexual misconduct in the hearing stage after being reported to the University.Land said the review would involve fewer than 20 cases dating back to August.Casares was hired in 2011 as the associate dean of students and director of student ethics, according to a 2011 IU press release. Before coming to IU, Casares worked as an assistant dean of students at the University of Arizona.In a statement from Casares\\' lawyer, Tony Paganelli, Casares denied \"false accusations of sexual misconduct,\" made by Jill L. Creighton, an assistant director for global community standards at New York University.\"Ms Creighton has made inappropriate and false public statements reasserting her claims against Mr. Casares over social media, and in person to the attendees at an ASCA conference this week in Florida,\" Paganelli said in the statement.Land said the University\\'s review of Casares will likely include a review of the statements made on social media.\"The University found out about this Wednesday evening when the accuser\\'s letter to her fellow members of the Association for Student Conduct Administration became public,\" Land said in an email. \"He has been placed on paid administrative leave by the University while we investigate the claims made against him.\"Title IX is a federal law prohibiting discrimination in any federally funded education program based on gender. The law provides specific protections against sexual harassment and sexual violence in educational institutions.The University underwent a Title IX compliance review in 2014 mandated by the United States Department of Education\\'s Office of Civil Rights. A new Sexual Assault Misconduct Policy was enacted in early 2015 in response to the review. The policy set a standard that \"responsible employees,\" meaning all University employees that directly engage with students, are legally required by the Office of Civil Rights to report sexual misconduct.In his position as associate dean of students and deputy Title IX director, Casares oversaw sexual assault hearings involving IU students.Upon learning Casares would be allowed to attend an ASCA conference this week in St. Petersburg, Creighton posted an open letter Wednesday on Twitter. As we speak on moral courage, I share mine. You voted me President-Elect, please read my open letter to you: https://t.co/17bwRuu38b #asca16In her letter, Creighton said Casares, the former ASCA president-elect, took advantage of her after she had too much to drink at a convention in Fort Worth, Texas, in December.Creighton, claiming she felt unsafe in the ASCA, said she then filed a criminal complaint with police in Texas.Fort Worth Police Department officer Daniel Segura confirmed a sexual assault investigation case is open in the department, and that contact was made with Creighton at around 9:30 p.m. Dec. 9, 2015.“I also could not stand the hypocrisy of Jason parading his expertise on Title IX, knowing how he had behaved with me,” Creighton said in the letter. “When I knew it could blow up in my face, and that I had nothing to gain but my own sense of safety, I asked ASCA to impeach Jason.\"[An IDS investigation delving into sexual assault at IU cited Casares as a source. Read a reporter\\'s personal experience with Casares and Title IX proceedings.]In the letter, Creighton said although she was asked to maintain confidentiality impeachment hearings related to Creighton\\'s formal complaint, Casares had resigned from his position as ASCA president-elect after being given the option of resignation during impeachment hearings.“For those of you who will doubt me, or be swayed by Jason’s implausible stories to explain myself,” Creighton said in the letter. “I did not consent to sexual contact with Jason.”Creighton said in the letter she believed she was risking her role as future ASCA president by speaking out and that the ASCA has not had her back.“My story is my own, and I hope you use it to demand that ASCA live up to its ideals,” Creighton said in the letter. “I have a right to participate here. You elected me, and I want to be able to give my service to this Association without experiencing a hostile environment throughout the rest of my term and for as many years as I continue to be an active and dedicated member.”Creighton has taken a leave of absence from her role on the ASCA board and said in the letter she would return to her duties when ready.On Thursday, the ASCA Board of Directors responded in a letter to its members confirming that the ASCA received a formal complaint from Creighton on Dec. 10, 2015.According to the letter, the ASCA Board of Directors hired an independent investigator from Hutcheson Bowers LLLP, an Austin, Texas, law firm to “conduct an investigation and present findings to the board.”In the letter, the ASCA board said the law firm found “Ms. Creighton’s claims could not be substantiated,” and the complaint was resolved in an executive session.According to the ASCA board letter, Casares resigned as ASCA president-elect on Jan. 29, 2016, but remains an ASCA member with “the same rights as other members to attend and present at ASCA events.”“ASCA is working to accommodate the needs of both Ms. Creighton and Mr. Casares during this difficult time, taking into account safety and privacy precautions,” the board said in the letter.According to the letter, the complaint resolution has come to a close and the association is “focused on the future and moving forward.”Read Creighton\\'s full open letter, posted on her Twitter account, here:',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Interfraternity Council is forming a mental health committee, the first of its kind for the IFC in IU history, this semester.The goal of this committee is to educate members of the chapters about mental health and depression, Committee Chairman and Director of Mental Health Andrew Haffner said.The committee will also bring awareness to substance abuse.Haffner said he has seen numerous people from his hometown in Fort Wayne, Indiana, suffer from life-altering events because of substance abuse.“I want to be able look back on my college experience and know that I tried to make a difference,” he said.One of the activities Vice President of Development Dan Cummins said he plans for the committee to get involved with the Greek Leadership Academy.The Academy is a monthly program put on by the Department of Student Life and Learning for greek life presidents. It gives leadership training and discussion-based courses.Also, Haffner said he is planning to look into different private organizations that offer device-based mental health screenings to patients in doctors’ offices.Though the IFC did appoint its first mental health director in December 2015, Cummins said this is the first committee ever made by IFC at IU regarding mental health.Inspired by the panhellenic mental health committee formed last semester, he said he decided to expand upon the idea of the mental health director and form an IFC mental health committee.“I think it’s an issue that’s important to talk about and important to realize,” he said.Additionally, Cummins said he was motivated by the sheer growth of the sexual assault awareness campaign that took place in the greek life system last semester.Though he said he will still bring awareness to the issues behind sexual assaults on campus, he would like to reach that level on enthusiasm and cooperation for the committee.“My goal for the committee is to have at least one member per chapter represented in the committee,” he said.By emailing applications to each of the chapter presidents on campus, who then forward them to chapter members, Cummins said he has been trying to get all chapters involved.The committee plans to have its first official meeting within the next couple of weeks, Cummins said.He said he is working with Haffner to review applications for membership.More than 20 applications have been submitted, and Cummins said he would like to reduce that number to between 12 and 15.“I wanted to identify specific issue areas that are directly related to membership development and personal growth,” Cummins said.Another benefit Haffner said he hopes will come from the committee is the restructuring of a better reputation for greek life.“The greek community as a whole has been suffering to get positive publicity for many years,” he said. “It is important for IFC to adopt such a committee because we need to continue to shed light on the good that greek chapters bring to a university and community.”Cummins said he believes bringing awareness to grave issues like mental health, substance abuse and sexual assault are what greek life is all about, and will help make a significant difference in the community.“We join these organizations that hold these values very dear to our hearts,” he said. “And I think it’s really important that we continue to strive to find ways to develop ourselves personally to make sure we’re providing resources, education and support for our members in any way possible.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Interfraternity Council officially added two amendments to the IFC Standards’ constitution in an attempt to hold fraternities more accountable for their actions.In order to combat unruly fraternity behavior, IFC President Ryan Zuckerman said he is taking precautions by approving these amendments.“The idea behind these standards is to be proactive in responding to issues while attempting to reduce the amount of chapters that visit the Student Organization Ethics Board each year,” he said.According to the first of these amendments, sanctions may only be placed by the IFC Standards Board on individual fraternities after said fraternity has organized a formal hearing with the IFC Standards Board.Fines, loss of eligibility for Greek-related awards, public service, social probation and suspension are examples of sanctions which IFC Standards Board can now place on chapters.If a chapter fails to comply with the sanction, a formal hearing will take place with the vice president of standards Thomas McDonald, as well as IU Department of Student Life and Learning, at a second hearing. Further actions would be discussed at this hearing.According to the second amendment added to the IFC Constitution, chapters can appeal any of the sanctions placed upon them by the IFC Standards Board.Chapter presidents can notify McDonald of their intention to appeal within 48 hours of the sanction being placed.The chapter president, as well as two additional chapter members, can present a case to the IFC Appeal Committee.Afterward, the IFC Appeal Committee will send their approval or denial to the appeal within 48 hours of the hearing.Given the suspension of Phi Kappa Psi and the revoking of Alpha Tau Omega’s charter, McDonald said he would like to improve the reputation for Greek life.“We represent a large amount of members of the University,” he said. “So I think it’s really important that as an entire Greek community, we start holding each other accountable.”Referring to fraternities and sororities as “values-based organizations,” Zuckerman said the rise in negative coverage for Greek communities is due to chapters not taking responsibility for their actions. He denies any relation between the events with ATO and Phi Psi and the new amendments.“While the update to the policies is not directly connected to Alpha Tau Omega or Phi Kappa Psi, both situations simply support the conclusion that the community is not adequately taking accountability,” he said.Public awareness of these sort of affairs are increasing, McDonald said, on account of numerous “societal flaws,” as well as an increased use of social media.By “societal flaws,” he said he is specifically referring to the double-standard the media has against the heinous actions of fraternities and sororities.There wouldn’t be as much media coverage, he said, if a sexual assault occurred in an apartment complex, as opposed to a fraternity or sorority. He said this is so because it’s “easier to point the finger at an organization than an individual.”Zuckerman said he believes IFC and the University are now taking the proper actions to combat these controversies from occurring as often in the future.Despite this, McDonald warned the chapters that the amendments can only make a difference in the Greek community if the community cooperates.“The University can only do so much,” he said. “It’s really up to the individual chapters to make the difference.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'There is no student safety problem that cannot be fixed with a good piece of legislation, said Anne-Therese Ryan, the Residence Hall Association vice president of student affairs.Ryan helped moderate a town hall meeting Monday night to address campus and residence hall safety.Ryan works to take student concerns about safety and draft them into legislation to present to IU administration.“The reason for this isn’t just to get angry about safety issues that we think we can’t fix,” Ryan said. “The goal here is to take the issues we find most pressing and write something that can fix them.”Better campus lighting, pedestrian safety and clearer emergency alerts systems were among the main issues addressed by students at the meeting.“Lighting in places that are dangerous at night is really the first step to changing a lot of the campus’ safety problems, so it would be great to get the administration on board with that,” senior Taylor Hurt, an RA in Collins, said. “I care a lot about my residents’ safety and my own safety, and it sometimes feels more unsafe than ever here.”Hurt said she thinks fixing problems with safety on campus at night could help with a decrease in assaults and other crimes.“There have been so many sexual assaults and other deaths on campus just in the last semester,” Hurt said. “We say we have a culture of care, but how are we actually holding students and administration accountable?”The campus emergency alert system, which uses calls, texts and emails to inform students of dangerous situations, was also addressed.“The notifications are important, but they don’t always make sense to me,” freshman Kaylee Slont said. “A lot of times we’ll get a second alert that says the scene is safe, but they didn’t find the suspect, and that always makes me a little nervous.”Many students also expressed concern over building accessibility on campus. Some doors, bathrooms and stairs on campus are not adequately equipped for students with disabilities, freshman Dylan Moore said.Trenton Dunham, RHA student advocacy committee chair, said while solutions are not often among student discussion, problem solving is where the RHA steps in.“We sometimes feel like students don’t fully grasp their own impact on campus policy,” Dunham said. “We want the RHA to be a channel students know they can go through to bring up concerns, and then we can go ahead and press to make those changes.”The RHA also takes topics discussed at IUSA meetings and helps push for their legislation, Ryan said. In the last year, the RHA helped create the Spectrum learning community, a residence center allied with the GLBT student support services office.The RHA will continue having town halls on different subjects throughout the semester in order to seek feedback for legislation, Ryan said.“We’re happy even if only one student shows up,” Ryan said. “That’s one voice that we didn’t have yesterday.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Artist Milo Moiré protested the New Year’s Eve sexual assaults in Cologne, Germany, by posing naked and holding a sign that read, “Respect us! We are not fair game even when we are naked.”She believes using art to shock an audience could attack the tender issue, reported Ivan Hewett of the Telegraph.And she’s beating a dead, meaningless horse.In the past, shock art, from surrealism to Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring,” has successfully made statements about society.But Moiré‘s nudity was superficial in approaching the complicated issue of assault. If her unconventional protest is art, then one might think art is meaningless.This nihilism, meaning the loss of an objective meaning in accordance with rules, norms or truths, has been with us for a while.Punk rock and metal declare there is no future. In “Pulp Fiction,” Jules’ Bible verse doesn’t mean anything. And the Joker doesn’t want money or power. He just wants to watch the world burn.News outlets replace reality with entertainment or what makes us feel good. Advertisements rely on short-lived feelings rather than virtues and judgments.It becomes a sentimental nihilism, wrote Kit Wilson of the magazine Standpoint.As philosopher Cornel West put it in his book “Democracy Matters,” sentimental nihilists are “willing to sidestep or even bludgeon the truth or unpleasant and unpopular facts and stories, in order to provide an emotionally satisfying show.”While Moiré used the emotional shock of nudity in this way, we college students are no exception.We use safe political correctness, safe spaces and microaggressions on grounds of emotion, not reason. We coddle ourselves away from ideas we don’t like to hear through protests and activism.Our social media uses the folly feelings as well. We like to think we can change the world with a hashtag, an online petition or anything similar.Research has shown those who use social media are more likely to censor themselves than those who don’t. People with dissenting opinions don’t speak out due to fear they’ll be dismissed or isolated.I don’t have an easy answer to all these issues. But we need to be more critical and reflective. We need to embrace free thought and recognize the reality of the world.Essena O’Neill has talked about using social media to show our true selves. The blog-publishing platform Medium encourages lengthy, immersive stories, rather than short, context-less pieces of information.Moiré‘s work was shallow, but we can create works of art and media that are more meaningful. We need to engage disagreement, not ignore it.If we don’t, we’ll wake up in the same tomorrow like in “Groundhog Day.”Don’t bother trying to fight the rules. There aren’t any.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Influenced by the popular TV show “Shark Tank,” the Interfraternity Council at IU is revamping the strategy involving its philanthropy.At a philanthropy committee Jan. 27, IFC’s Vice President of Community Programs Jesse Scheinman said he would like to kick-start IFC’s very own “Shark Tank.”Though not directly involved with the ABC reality show, Scheinman’s project will be similar because it will be a workshop of people proposing new ideas, with other people there to critique them.He said this will be an informal event that will involve meeting with two to three chapters per week.However, he said IFC won’t be limiting itself to just its fraternities, but instead opening up to the entire community. He said he believes restricting the shark tank in that way would violate its core standards as an organization.“The purpose of IFC isn’t just to fit the fraternities,” Scheinman said. “The purpose of IFC is to benefit the campus and your community as a whole.”With this, Scheinman said he would like to start doing post-evaluations of each chapter. These will help decide which chapters IFC would like to focus on by “utilizing its strengths and minimizing its weaknesses,” he said.He also said he would like proposals to be thoroughly fleshed out and articulated before they are sent to IFC. He said this would also help determine whether or not the one with the idea can speak at the shark tank.Half of the philanthropy meeting was dedicated to the shark tank proposal. The second half featured the development of new ideas from committee members.Delta Tau Delta philanthropy chairperson Ryan Sondles said he participated with his chapter last semester in the No Shave November event to raise money to combat testicular cancer.He said his chapter started a GoFundMe page and asked sororities for assistance in fundraising in order to receive donations for the cause. Delts also makes its own T-shirts for the event, where they sold 237 shirts and raised $2,450 overall.Sondles said he would like to receive funding in order to repeat the event next fall semester.Sigma Alpha Epsilon philanthropy chairperson Alec Imaizumi said he was a part of the Bubble Soccer Tournament last semester. He said he raised $5,000 in family donations, T-shirt sales and expenses to participate in the event.For this semester, he said he would like SAE to put together a soap box derby-styled race. He said this would be an event that would be open to fraternities, sororities and even non-greek members.Beta Sigma Psi philanthropy chairperson William Hughes said he was active in the involvement with the Mash Out Homelessness event which failed to occur last semester during midterms week.Hughes said this event was supposed to be a car smash and all of the funds were supposed to go to Habitat for Humanity. He said he was unable to do it because he couldn’t get it to be put on during midterms.However, he said for the spring semester, he would like to play host to a Dine and Donate event, which he said he would like to be at BuffaLouie’s, though the location has yet to be confirmed.Along with all of these ideas, Scheinman said IFC would like to work harder this semester with associated member organizations, as well as other campus or non-campus organizations that are directly tied with IFC’s goal of giving back to the community.“We want to work with the organizations where our collaboration can be really beneficial,” he said. “Not just this year, but next year, next semester, five years from now.”Above all Scheinman said one of his main concerns this semester is giving back to the community through service and philanthropy as a collective.One way he said he would like to do this is to bring more awareness to sexual assault on campus with the greek organization Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault. He said it is the goal of this organization, and IFC as a whole, to build better men “through education, awareness and activism.”“I wanted to form this community because I’m not afraid of failing,” he said. “I’m afraid of not trying.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Two unrelated Bloomington women each reported a sexual assault Wednesday, according to police records.At about 2:48 p.m. Wednesday, a 40-year-old woman called the Bloomington Police Department to report an alleged rape she said took place in October 2015.She decided to report the assault to police Wednesday because she discovered photos of herself in her former boyfriend’s computer files showing her partially nude and changing clothing, BPD Lt. John Kovach said, reading off of a report.The woman said in October, her then-boyfriend, 37, was intoxicated and at her residence. He told her he was going to drive home and she urged him not to drive while intoxicated and told him he could sleep at her house instead.The couple fell asleep, and the woman woke up to the man forcing himself on her, Kovach said. They then got into an argument about the definition of rape, she said. The woman told him it was not consensual, but the man said that it was.Later that day, the two of them attended a family function together, and afterward they had consensual sex, Kovach said. They had consensual sex again days later.After seeing the photos of herself, which she had not given her boyfriend permission to take, she decided to pursue rape charges against him. The case remains under investigation, Kovach said.In a separate case, a 32-year-old woman called police at 4:48 p.m. Wednesday from the Kroger at Seminary Square to report a sexual assault.She reported that she had been with a man that she knew at his house on the 500 block of South College Avenue that night. She had taken what she thought was Tylenol P.M. but she was feeling “funny.”At one point she woke up and noticed that he was naked. She was not sure if anything had happened between them, but she felt dirty, she told police.She left the house and went to Kroger to call BPD. A detective then met the woman at Kroger and took her to the hospital for a sexual assault nurse examination.However, the woman left the hospital shortly afterward, before receiving treatment. A BPD detective called the woman, and she told him she still hoped to pursue charges, and she would return to the hospital.After returning to the hospital, the woman told a nurse she wanted medication to help calm her nerves. The nurse told her she would have to wait to talk to the doctor in order to receive medication prior to the exam.The woman then became upset and left the hospital before receiving treatment, Kovach said.Both cases remain under police investigation.Samantha Schmidt',\n",

       "  'body': 'Actor Jesse Eisenberg has a history of philanthropy work in arts education and environmentalism. This semester, he is expanding his activism to a nonprofit organization in Bloomington.Eisenberg has collaborated with Middle Way House to raise funds for sexual assault and domestic violence. Donations from IU student groups to the “I’m With Jesse” campaign will be matched, dollar-for-dollar, by Eisenberg. The campaign is open from now until April 3. Students interested in participating can register at imwithjesse.org.“The Middle Way House seems to me to be growing in exactly the right ways and it is very much a model organization,” Eisenberg said. “I’ve never seen an organization so efficient and responsible with its funds and I felt it was a wonderful cause.”Middle Way House was founded in 1971 and helps with housing, employment, child care and other needs for women affected by sexual assault and domestic violence. It also advocates for awareness of these issues.Eisenberg said he was introduced to Middle Way House through Bloomington resident Anna Strout, whom he met 15 years ago. Strout is the daughter of Toby Strout, Middle Way House’s executive director.“Jesse’s visited a few times and this summer he came on a tour of our facilities and our mission and that’s where this all started,” said Jim Davis, Middle Way House’s fund development coordinator. “His excitement and willingness to provide and participate on behalf of Middle Way House is thrilling to us.”Eisenberg’s personal ties to Middle Way House are the primary reason for his involvement in Bloomington, he said. Though he has done other charity and philanthropic works, this is his first involvement with sexual assault and domestic violence.Eisenberg said though he doesn’t think he’s earned the right to be an advocate for these issues, he feels to not help would be a missed opportunity.“There are all sorts of odd consequences that come from having a public persona, but this certainly isn’t one of them,” Eisenberg said. “It’s one of the perks to be able to pick a cause you care about for any reason and really try to help.”Money raised during the campaign will go toward paying off the mortgage on Middle Way House’s New Wings facility, which houses administrative offices and hotline services. The building was opened in 2010 as Middle Way House expanded its services, Davis said.“It would be an incredible thing to retire that mortgage,” Toby Strout said.“To have every part of our funds go towards our services instead of having to send a chunk of it off to the bank — that would be amazing.”At the end of the campaign, there will be a drawing for prizes, including a private movie screening with Eisenberg, dinner with Eisenberg and autographed merchandise from “Batman v. Superman,” Eisenberg’s upcoming movie.Student groups will get one drawing entry for every $100 donated.There will also be a grand prize for the student group that donates the greatest amount of money.IU students helped develop the details of the contest, Davis said.“These students were extremely important to the project because it’s not something I could have conceived of at all,” Eisenberg said. “I have no idea how student groups at colleges work. So it’s cool that their idea, which I wouldn’t have expected, has turned into such a big project.”The partnership with students for the fundraiser reflects Middle Way House’s own relationship with IU, Toby Strout said.IU provides resources for Middle Way House and students are also often victims of sexual assault and domestic violence whom Middle Way House serves, she said.The connection between Middle Way House’s mission and the college student demographic made the planning of the fundraising campaign come naturally, Eisenberg said.He said he might consider doing more service and philanthropy work for sexual assault and domestic violence in the future.“It seems like 90 percent of my public life is trying to conjure up more excitement to talk about a movie I did a year or so ago,” Eisenberg said. “So while this cause is new and sort of strange for me, it’s something more immediate and important, and it is work that feels valuable to me.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'After an hour and 15 minutes passed from the original trial time, Jerald Honeycutt walked into the courtroom with a smile on his face, plopped himself into a chair and lowered it to its lowest setting.In July, Honeycutt, 34, was arrested on charges of rape connected to the sexual assault of a 73-year-old woman in Bloomington. After months of delay on his case, Honeycutt showed up to court in his black- and gray-striped jumpsuit, with a full beard and wearing a silver crucifix.His sentencing hearing was scheduled for Thursday morning, but it didn’t happen because Honeycutt decided last-minute to change his guilty plea. Instead, his new hearing will be Feb. 4.This was discovered after Judge Marc Kellams asked Honeycutt’s attorney, Jeremy Noel, if he needed more time.Noel informed Kellams his client had just told him new reasons why he would like to withdraw his guilty plea that would require research and further conversations with Honeycutt.Representing the State, Darcie Fawcett protested this request immediately stating the court needed to make a record on this case and quit delaying. She said the request needed to be made in writing and that Honeycutt has had since Jan. 4 to prepare this statement.“Since Jan. 4 the court committed itself to do what needed to be done due to the elderly age of both victims and to protect their testimonies,” Fawcett said.Fawcett argued delaying the hearing today is putting the State in an impossible position that would require both women to go through depositions and relive their traumatizing assaults.Kellams agreed the process should be done quickly but said he didn’t feel he could deny the defense time to make this request and therefore set the new date for Honeycutt’s sentencing hearing at 10 a.m. Feb. 4.“Due process demands that I let the defense do this,” Kellams said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Interfraternity Council will be making major changes to the recruitment process this semester.Traditionally, fraternity and sorority recruitment tend to be very different, with the latter being the more “formal,” said Max Lundin, vice president of IFC recruitment. IFC also has two rushes each year, while the Panhellenic Association only has one in spring.However, for this recruitment IFC is becoming slightly more similar to PHA in terms of giving more exposure to each of the chapters on campus, Lundin said.IFC is the umbrella organization for all of the fraternity chapters on campus. Likewise, the PHA serves the same purpose for all of the sorority chapters on campus.“We’re trying to make it so you have more formalized education on what the different chapters have to offer,” he said. “We want to give the men who are rushing a more in-depth view into the chapters they are seeing.”Lundin said he wants to inform the potential new members of what each chapter has to offer, receive feedback from them and allow them to explore all of their options on their own until they find their ideal match.“My goal is that rush becomes more of a process to where every guy is going to get exposure to every different chapter he is going to want to see,” Lundin said.On Jan. 29, IFC will be putting on a Greek Orientation Seminar, something relatively new to the IFC recruitment process.Lundin said this will be a large presentation featuring all the presidents from the different chapters across campus, as well as representatives from Greek communities like the Multi-Cultural Greek Council and the National Pan-Hellenic Council.Exposure to these two organizations is important because it shows that IFC and PHA are not the only Greek communities on campus.“We want to show them that this is a community that we want to be progressive,” he said.IFC’s Vice President of Community Programs Jesse Scheinman said he would also like to use the seminar as an opportunity to promote organizations like Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault.On Jan. 31, when rush officially begins, IFC will put on rush tabling at the Indiana Memorial Union Solarium. At this event, potential new members will be meeting with different Greek organizations on campus at different tables. This is done as a means of better familiarizing the potential new members with what Greek life is about, Lundin said.On Feb. 1 and 2, there will be tours of all the different fraternity chapters on campus.Originally, IFC recruitment would consist of only the tabling and house tours, so this is a big step toward change, Lundin said. It allows for a broader representation of Greek life than what has been given in the past.For this recruitment, Lundin said IFC is looking for trustworthy, ambitious potential new members. He said chapter presidents want members who won’t get their chapter revoked.“These are the guys that you’re going to need when you need someone most, so those are the guys you should be looking for,” he said.Following recruitment, Scheinman said IFC plans on educating new members on issues like sexual assault on campus. On top of this, he will be informing members of the philanthropy community service opportunities to get involved in.“We hope to get the new members on a macro-community scale,” he said.Given the recent controversy and suspensions of IU chapters like Alpha Tau Omega and Phi Kappa Psi, Lundin said he recognizes there may be a hesitancy to join a fraternity.However, he said he believes members typically join with the intent of not getting their chapter revoked, so he doesn’t think it will drastically change their turnout of members recruiting this year.“Everyone wants a community that works well together, and rush is the first step in creating that community,” Lundin said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The small front room of Boxcar Books darkened shortly after 7 p.m. A projector screen glowed and members of the group Students Against State Violence outlined the group’s beliefs and discussed plans for the coming year.Students Against State Violence is an “anti-capitalist organization of students/community members building a movement against forms of state violence,” according to the group’s PowerPoint presentation.They defined state violence as “any form of repression by which the privileged elite perpetuates economic, social and political disenfranchisement of the masses” in their presentation.Group members spoke to a room of about 30 people about their collective wish to fight socioeconomic inequality, unequal wealth distribution, imperialism, patriarchy, white supremacy and anti-blackness.Freshman Jen Bale was one of the newcomers to SASV. After speaking with members from SASV at an involvement fair, she decided to go to the callout meeting.“Of all the callout meetings I’ve been to, this is the one I’ve been the most passionate about,” she said. “It seems like there’s more of an initiative to change things.”Bale said she doesn’t feel safe when she sees police cars and doesn’t understand why officers seem to constantly patrol IU’s campus.Now, she said she plans to become involved with the Revolutionary Strategy Film/Reading Series the group is planning to hold sometime this year. She said she wants to help educate people about social issues.“I definitely want to get involved,” Bale said.The group doesn’t have officers or a heirarchy of structure, a group member said. But they do have separate committees for varying issues.Along with the series, SASV has other developments in the works.The Campaign Against Patriarchal Assault works to educate people about patriarchal issues — namely sexual assault. The CAPA has already orchestrated demonstrations. In the future, it plans to start a late-night safety escort service, hold a film series and begin offering self-defense classes.The group also plans to continue its prisoner support program. This semester they will hold a Q&A session with Keith LaMar, a prisoner on Death Row whom members of SASV believe to be falsely accused.It will also continue work with the Black Lives Matter movement in Gary, Indiana and Cincinnati and with undocumented activist organizations like the Indiana Undocumented Youth Alliance.The group meets at 8 p.m. every Monday in Woodburn Hall 202.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A Bloomington man was arrested and charged with the rape of a 25-year-old woman after photos and videos of passed-out, nude women were found on his phone.Robert E. Childers, 26, was booked into the Monroe County Jail on Friday on a warrant for rape after a weekslong investigation into the case. He posted bond shortly after.The 25-year-old woman told officials that on the night before Thanksgiving of 2015, Childers came to her house with a bottle of Jim Beam at about 8 or 9 p.m.They had decided to drink together and hang out, Bloomington Police Department Sgt. Shane Rasche said.After heavy drinking, the woman blacked out. The last thing she remembers was standing in her kitchen. She woke up the next morning noticing that her genital area was wet, but she didn’t know whether or not anything had happened the night before, according to the police report.Childers and the woman had previously been in a brief relationship in the early summer of 2015, but the woman said the sex they had during that time was consensual.She told Childers soon after that she didn’t want to continue having sex because she didn’t want to jeopardize their friendship, Rasche said.BPD detectives began investigating the case earlier this month when a different woman told police she had seen photos and videos on her ex-boyfriend Childers’ phone that were disturbing to her.In May, she saw a video of a woman passed out on a couch, facedown, wearing no pants. She noticed a man’s hands inserting objects into the woman’s genital area, Rasche said.In December, while she was drinking with her then-boyfriend, Childers, she was able to look at his phone while he was passed out.She noticed more photos and videos of nude women, who appeared to be unconscious, in photo albums categorized by the name of each woman. She saw in one of these videos that Childers’ hand appeared to have penetrated a woman’s genital area.Childers contacted the 25-year-old woman Jan. 13, telling her that he wanted to harm himself and that police were investigating him, according to the report. Childers asked her to speak with his attorney and deny knowing anything about the videos.Meanwhile, he admitted to the woman he took pictures and videos of her that were sexual in nature while she was unconscious.The following day, the woman reached out to officials to report a sexual assault.When the 25-year-old woman told her story to detectives, her description of multi-colored blankets on a couch matched blankets that were pictured in one of these videos.Detectives then confirmed the 25-year-old woman was the same woman as the one in the videos.The case is still under investigation, Rasche said.',\n",

Going home with someone might lead to the expectation of sleeping with them.Police in certain countries may not care about sexual assault. Even if you’re traveling domestically, you can still face some risks.If you’re in an unfamiliar location, it’s more difficult to make a quick escape if needed.And if you need any support from friends or family, they may not know where to find you.Casual sex is widely accepted in a college town like Bloomington, but depending on where you travel, this might not be the case.Let a friend or family member know where you are at all times.It’s easy to turn on your location on an iPhone or let someone know you’ll send a text at an expected time if everything is alright.As with any other online meet-up, you should always meet in a public place before heading back to anyone’s home.Make sure to keep your phone fully charged, your bank account with enough money to get home, a condom in your purse and a friend on speed dial.Finally, know that you are in charge of your body and can set your own boundaries.Whether you’re in Bloomington or Bulgaria, casual sex can be risky for a number of reasons.Take the right precautions, and you can feel free to enjoy all the casual hookups you like.',\n",

       "  'body': 'At the start of the new semester, the IU Student Association Congress set new goals and refreshed their commitments to old ones, including using time wisely, staying efficient and continuing to be leaders on campus.The IUSA Congress met for its first meeting of the spring semester Tuesday in the Dogwood Room of the Indiana Memorial Union to elect officials and discuss the coming term.Vice President Jalen Watkins told the Congress to continue to work efficiently and use its time wisely this semester, saying it needs to work together and find the most feasible way to get the job done.“I’m going to put trust in you all that we’re going to be talking about things that need to be discussed and not getting caught in the weeds,” Watkins said.Introducing himself to new members, Watkins told representatives their main goal is to interact with their constituents.“You’re the voice of whatever you’re representing,” Watkins said. “We need to hear from the student body, and we need to make it more accessible.”Throughout the meeting, Watkins stressed the importance of time efficiency during the semester as well, giving a lot of this responsibility to the different committees.Every time Congress meets it needs to use its time wisely, he added.At the beginning of the meeting, Congress held elections for positions that change at term, including press secretary, grammarian, parliamentarian and speaker of Congress.The Congress elected William Hutchins for the position of congressman representing off-campus as press secretary, Carmen Stacy for the position of congressman representing the College of Arts and Sciences as grammarian, and Naomi Kellogg for the position of congresswoman representing the Greek extension as parliamentarian.Maria Halloran, congresswoman representing the College of Arts and Sciences, became the new speaker.Halloran agreed with Watkins, stressing the importance of staying efficient. She told Congress she wants to be an open resource for representatives to know how to use their time most efficiently.“I think you guys come here with a lot of great ideas and a lot of purpose, but sometimes that can get lost in those little bureaucratic things we all have to deal with in Congress,” Halloran said.Dan Niersbach, director of freshman intern program and deputy treasurer, gave a brief presentation on IUSA executives’ recent trip to the Association of Big Ten Students conference.He provided the Congress with ideas that he said he thinks it could implement.Some of these ideas included creating subcommittees with faculty members, providing a sexual assault workshop that is required for students each year and redistricting congressional seats so cultural centers have seats.He also brought up ideas to reach out more to student athletes and create a bystander intervention program for bartenders and bouncers.Ending the meeting, Kellogg led a presentation on the structure of debating to refresh previous members and inform new members of the Congress.The presentation included vocabulary for representatives to use as they debate and the basic organization.Watkins urged representatives to be leaders on campus, staying cautious and conscientious of what students are saying around campus.“I think that our voice really is heard and it’s important to know that,” he said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'IU sexual assault statistics may be comparable to the national standards, but that doesn’t take away from the urgency of the campus’ situation, said Leslie Fasone, assistant dean of students of women’s and gender affairs.Fasone, along with Emily Springston, chief student welfare and Title IX officer, and Justin Garcia, assistant professor of gender studies, discussed the findings of the Sexual Assault Climate Survey at the first Bloomington Faculty Council meeting of the semester.The survey, which was conducted by the Division of Student Affairs, invited 41,768 undergraduate and graduate students to participate. It was sent out in November 2014 to gauge individual sexual assault experiences on and off campus. The survey was also sent out several times after.With a 23 percent response rate, Springston said feedback was moderate, but the information received from the survey was significant in providing insight.For example, the study found 35 percent of undergraduate women participants have experienced sexual harassment during their time at IU. In addition, 86 percent of the women who experienced sexual assault did not alert or report the incident to anyone on campus.Doubts were raised, particularly by Associate Professor of Law Steve Sanders, of the legitimacy of the analysis due to its lack of a random selection. Faculty members came to a consensus, however, that the survey’s results were important to move the conversation of sexual assault of campus in a positive direction.“This gives us some sense of scope, even if it’s not perfect,” IU Provost Lauren Robel said.The Sexual Assault Climate Survey, although generally representative of the campus’s student body, asked comprehensive questions on gender identity and sexual orientation, but those findings were excluded from the final analysis, on behalf of the safety of LGBT students.“When you have categories that become too small, you take them out because there’s a potential for identification,” Garcia said. “There is a plan in the future to do a report on sexual and gender minorities.”The survey didn’t ask questions about student-faculty incidents of sexual assault. However, Springston said the Student Welfare Initiative worked on training sessions for IU faculty and staff and spent time forming a committee of the graduate and professional schools that works to eliminate these circumstances.Fasone said the Division of Student Affairs has several plans to use this data and implement effective programs and support systems for students to use in times of need.“We are in the process of working with different student groups and cultural centers to create programs within our many departments on campus,” Fasone said. “We must engage these groups so that we can have a dialogue about education and prevention.”A campus-wide sexual violence prevention campaign is set to begin fall 2016. Fasone said her division is working on finalizing curricula on alcohol and consent that furthers the goals of My Student Body, the online course required for all incoming freshmen.“We want students to understand what alcohol and consent mean, and we are continually working with our current programs internally,” Fasone said.Read more IDS coverage of the Sexual Assault Climate Survey here.Community Attitudes and Experiences with Sexual Assault full report',\n",

       "  'body': 'In less than a month, the 10-part Netflix documentary crime series “Making a Murderer” has swept the nation.The documentary has outraged many people in the way it has revealed cracks in the our criminal justice system.It has even gone so far as to have prompted a petition with over 436,000 signatures for President Obama to pardon Steven Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey of their murder convictions illustrated in the documentary.The Obama administration has made it clear that the president does not have the power to pardon convictions at the state level.Despite this, support for Avery and Dassey has only grown more.The documentary follows the wrongful rape conviction for which Avery served 18 years, along with Avery and Dassey’s trials for the murder of Teresa Halbach in 2005.Spoiler alert for those of you who haven’t seen the series.“Making a Murderer” presented compelling evidence that Avery and Dassey were actually framed for the murder of Halbach.The documentary shows evidence of the murder and blames none other than the Manitowoc County Police and the officers who were negligent in the controversial case.As a result of this negligency, Avery served 18 years for a rape he didn’t commit before being exonerated by DNA evidence.There is much the public can do to help get Avery and his nephew released.Still, it is encouraging to see people come together to voice their opinions on something they are so passionate about.Expressing these opinions is the first stage in making a difference.Although it might not help Avery and Dassey, the documentary and the large outcry it prompted have shed light on the broken justice system we currently accept as fair.In my honest opinion, there is absolutely no way the prosecution in either case was able to prove without a reasonable doubt that Avery and his nephew were guilty of brutally sexually assaulting and murdering Halbach.How can people like OJ Simpson, who practically confessed to murder after his trial, walk free while people like Avery are forced to live out the remainder of their life in jail?We should ask the same question for people like Dassey, who had his youth ripped away from him.He was forced to spend what should have been the best days of his life behind bars.I’m not saying that Avery and Dassey are innocent.I don’t, nor will I ever, know what actually happened on that Halloween night when Halbach was murdered.What I do know is that two families have now had their hearts broken for a crime that was certainly not proven without a reasonable doubt.As a society, we need to ask ourselves, “Is our current justice system really the best we could do?”I hope the answer would be a resounding no from all of us.I’ll be honest, I’m not entirely sure how we could fix the damaged system nor am I sure I will ever know.I am sure that allowing just any 12 Joe Schmo’s to decide who walks free and who is sentenced to life in prison is not the best we could come up with.But if we hope to get anywhere on these kinds of issues, we have to continue to voice our opinions without backing down.We are a democracy, and, contrary to popular jaded belief, our thoughts and opinions do matter.We know that Avery and Dassey deserve better for what they’ve been through.We deserve better.tatadams@indiana.edu@TatianaDeWitt',\n",

       "  'body': 'By placing sanitary pads with a social message around campus, Quiet Grrrl member Shelby Everett said she hopes to spark a conversation about rape culture and the treatment of sexual assault cases on campus.Members of feminist organization Quiet Grrrl met Tuesday evening in the Indiana Memorial Union Maple Room to discuss their upcoming project, #PadsAgainstSexism. Members will post sanitary pads around campus with messages calling attention to rape culture and cultural perceptions of women’s bodies.“The goal is that it will be really shocking to people and so at the very least it will start a new conversation about rape culture and how devastating it is,” Everett said. “Especially on this campus, and the administration’s inability to address rape culture,” Everett said.The #PadsAgainstSexism initiative originated in Germany, where a woman named Elonë posted menstrual pads in public places like train stations. Pads had messages written on them like “Imagine if men were as disgusted by rape as they were by periods.” Quiet Grrrl members decided at the meeting to replicate this message on pads distributed throughout campus, but replacing “men” with “people.”“I think it’s really, really important to bring to attention the fact that society views women in very strange ways,” IU graduate and member Katelynn Dockerty said. “The University really struggles to handle sexual assault culture and cases of sexual assault. It’s important to me that we raise awareness about that.”Everett said the idea for the initiative is to highlight double standards set for female bodies.“As a culture, we think women are gross, but we also want to objectify them,” Everett said.The #PadsAgainstSexism demonstration will go hand in hand with a drive by Quiet Grrrl to collect feminine hygiene products. These will be donated to Middle Way House or another homeless shelter. Members will create collection boxes to be placed in central locations like dorms.Senior Savannah Lynch said the donation of feminine hygiene products has a potentially large impact on the Bloomington community.“These products are expensive to buy but really important because 50 percent of the population need them,” Lynch said.Quiet Grrrl member Emily Buis said the group hopes for the project to take place during warmer weather when more people are spending time outdoors.Everett said she wants to make use of social media and the hashtag #PadsAgainstSexism to raise awareness of and organize discussion about the initiative.“We’ve also talked about the possibility of hosting a discussion in conjunction — maybe with, like, a film screening or some speakers,” Everett said. “We just need this demonstration as the initial shock value to bring it to people’s attention and then from there do a lot more.”Lynch said she thinks exposure to the #PadsAgainstSexism movement is very important for college students.“I think it’s especially a potent message for a college audience because I think there’s such a culture of objectification and hyper-sexualization of female and non-binary bodies on campus,” Lynch said. “And it really focuses how we are culturally shaping the message around women’s bodies even when we are so disgusted by something as normal as periods.”Everett said she hopes the effects of the project are widely felt by the campus community.“We want everyone to be affected by it, at the very least in terms of rethinking how desperate we are to get people talking about it,” Everett said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Shortly after returning from winter break, IU Student Association members will travel to Rutgers University in New Jersey.On Jan. 15, IUSA will participate in the winter conference for the Association of Big Ten Students, a coalition of each of the Big Ten universities. Each university sends a delegation to the conference to discuss issues and write legislation.IUSA’s delegation includes Patrick Lockhart, director of state and legislative affairs; Tatiana Padilla, vice president of administration; Dan Niersbach, deputy treasurer and intern program director; and Sara Zaheer, chief of staff.“What we do at these weekend-long conferences is learn from each other,” Padilla said. “As student leaders from Big Ten schools we have a lot in common. By discussing the real issues that our campuses face, we become a network of more efficient student governments.”ABTS meets three times a year in August, April and January. Each meeting has a different purpose. At the winter conference, members will be focused on proposing and setting legislation.ABTS legislation is a way for all schools to pursue a certain campaign or initiative. Once legislation is passed, each student government association carries it out in a way specific to their campus, Zaheer said.IUSA will focus on legislation for diversity and inclusion. Before delegates arrive at Rutgers, Zaheer will work with delegates from other universities to write legislation.“Essentially, the legislation we propose is a way for us to do a collective campaign as the Big Ten to bring awareness to an issue that otherwise might not get as much publicity or attention,” Lockhart said.Each student government will also have the opportunity to listen and give presentations on an issue they have worked on, including sexual assault, cost of college and campus sustainability.“This is mostly to exchange ideas, teach best practices and point out any roadblocks that come along with addressing the different items,” Lockhart said.IUSA will give its presentation on student safety both on and off campus. Zaheer said IUSA delegates want to share what IUSA is doing to try to improve student safety on campus and include suggestions it has heard from students.Lockhart said it is important to hear the opinions of other schools on issues they faced and how they confronted them.“Bringing back different perspectives will help IUSA more effectively create change for the student body,” Lockhart said.Members of ABTS keep in contact throughout the year and share how each school seeks to fix major issues such as safety, sexual violence and mental health, Zaheer said.Since ABTS represents nearly half a million college students, they have a lot of influence over students’ daily lives, Lockhart said.“By meeting together like this, getting on the same page, and focusing on tackling issues that we all face, we can more effectively govern than we otherwise would,” Lockhart added.When legislation is passed concerning college education, it helps or hurts all students, not just Big Ten students, Padilla said.“We have the power,” Padilla said. “Because we represent so many young adults, we have a duty to find common goals and fight for them full force.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'A man sought by police in connection with a sexual assault case died Friday after he leapt from the top of the IU HealthBloomington Hospital parking garage in an apparent suicide.BPD Sgt. Cody Forston said police had been looking for Craig Wade, 54, after the rape was reported the night before, but they hadn’t been able to find him. Early the next morning, police received a call that maintenance staff at the hospital had found a body.The officer who arrived at the scene recognized the body as the suspect in the rape case, Forston said.The initial assault was reported at around 8 p.m. Thursday at an apartment complex on the north side of town, Lt. John Kovach said.He said Wade and the woman who accused him, who is 20, lived in the same apartment complex. The woman told police Wade invited her into his apartment to talk. Once there, she reported, he slapped her and forced her onto the bed where he made her give oral sex before he raped her.Once he was done, she said, he told her to leave.Wade came to her door a while later when she told him she had called the police, she said, and at this statement, he fled.The call about the suicide came as police were searching for Wade Friday morning.No foul play was suspected in this incident, Forston said, making the death an apparent suicide. Kovach said police checked video cameras from the garage and the video showed that Wade had jumped on his own.Wade had a criminal record with charges varying from driving with a suspended license to burglary and dealing methamphetamine. The investigation of the rape is now closed, as Kovach said no follow-up investigation is necessary.',\n",

       "  'body': \"Lockhart Steele, the former editorial director at Vox Media was fired from his position on October 20 after allegations of sexual assault. Vox stated that Steele’s actions are not in line with the company’s values and that further allegations would be investigated. Vox claims its goal is “fostering a safe and welcoming community”. In order to do this, Vox Media cancelled its open bar at its holiday party in favor of two drink tickets. While the Editorial Board believes that limiting alcohol could potentially decrease the sexual assault that occurs at the party, we believe that this is a superficial one that does not address the underlying problems with sexual assault. Rather than removing alcohol from the company party, Vox should be removing people who make other employees feel uncomfortable. Alcohol doesn't sexually harass workers, employees who never should have been hired in the first place do.The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism states that just half of the sexual assault cases involve alcohol either by the “perpetrator, victim or both.” However, while alcohol consumption is correlated with the occurrence of sexual assault, it is not proven to cause sexual abuse. The study also found that wanting to commit sexual assault could lead a perpetrator to drink more. Additionally, women who drink more heavily have a positive correlation with sexual victimization.  Though alcohol consumption occurs with sexual assault, we think that Vox Media’s actions do not do enough to address the problems associated with sexual assault. There are more underlying problems associated with sexual assault than just alcohol consumption. There are also questions about the perpetrator’s pathology, overall cultural trends and the perceived sexual availability of women. Anna Voremberg, managing editor of the End Rape on Campus, stated that alcohol bans aren’t effective. “They don’t prevent sexual assault … Alcohol doesn’t cause rape.”Vox Media’s actions does not really address the underlying problems of sexual assault. Instead, an alternate prevention program should be used instead. The Center for Disease Control has only shown three programs to be effective in preventing sexual assaults. In order to have an effective program, these programs need to address multiple conditions and causes, and offer multiple strategies on how to address the problem. Limiting employees to two drinks rather than reevaluating hiring practices and company culture is a superficial fix to a deep-seeded problem.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'From holiday-themed musicals to plays covering domestic violence, the Monroe County Civic Theater’s Director’s Symposium & Variety Show strives to bring the community together, said Steve Heise, director of Monroe County Civic Theater.The Director’s Symposium & Variety Show will be presented Dec. 10 at the Players Pub.For its 18th iteration, the free show offers a dozen acts featuring three theatrical productions and a variety of musical acts. A silent auction happen at intermission, and all proceeds will go to the benefit of The Rise! at the Middle Way House.The Rise! at the Middle Way House is a Bloomington nonprofit organization that provides shelter and services for survivors of domestic violence, human trafficking and sexual assault.“We want the audience to come and have a good time and watch the talent of Bloomington and give to a good cause,” said Maryann Iaria, administrative secretary of Monroe County Civic Theater.The event will focus on children’s sing-along songs in the beginning, Christmas carols and spiritual music led by folk group the Helber Sisters Band. One of the theatrical productions, “Santa Claus is Coming to Town,” will be performed by the Monroe County Civic Theater Players with music and singing.“The first part of the show are where the children are singing, and it’s really more of a children’s event,” Heise said. “The end of the show has some more adult themes.”Another theatrical production for the event, “What if?” concerns domestic violence and how it can be prevented. Heise said the more serious topics are saved for after intermission.“It concentrates on how people can avoid being in violent situations and how domestic violence can be acknowledged,” Iaria said.Because the event has such contrasting themes, parents and children don’t have to stay to the end, Heise said.All of the theatrical productions are written by Bloomington playwrights, and local businesses will be providing items for the silent auction.Attending the event is a good opportunity to connect with the community and do something enjoyable, Iaria said.“Our theater promotes that anyone can be in show business, and especially in Bloomington, in any age,” Iaria said.Donations and money raised at the silent auction will benefit The Rise! at the Middle Way House. “Who ends up at The Rise! are effectively refugees in their own community,” Heise said. “The reason we do that is because they do really, really important work in the community.”Aside from supporting a good cause,Heise said, this event enables people to make community members more aware of each other.“You look outside, there’s a lot of discord that we can’t do anything about,” Heise said. “What we can do is get together as a community do things that bring us together and make us feel good about the community.”Heise said audience members can turn their entertainment into smiles for people who have had a difficult time with domestic violence.“The Civic Theatre is really about building community,\" Heise said. \"That\\'s the whole idea.

       "  'body': 'Melanie Martinez, pop singer and winner of \"The Voice,\" is the latest artist to be accused of sexual assault.An old friend of Martinez, Timothy Heller, released a statement on Twitter about her sexual abuse without mentioning a name at first, but later clarified that it was Martinez. When I wrote this story about my assault, I initially wasn’t going to make the abuser. But I think it’s important for you all to know this is about Melanie Martinez pic.twitter.com/4PQ5oNI2s9Heller’s statement is heartbreaking, especially knowing that she had refused Martinez multiple times and even repressed it for years, thinking that this was a normal thing that occurred among friends. However, the most disturbing aspect of all of this is the response by Martinez’s fanbase. The victim was immediately ambushed by fans saying it was false and that Heller was doing all of this to bring Martinez’s name down. Some even questioned the timing of the statement, insinuating that this could just be a move to capitalize on other accusers being exposed.There is a disturbing trend surrounding these recent accusations. Instead of supporting the survivors and victims, fans are turning these situations around and making them about themselves. Fans of various artists who have been accused claim that these accusations cannot possibly be true because of one case where a fan lied saying singer Conor Oberst raped her. These allegations have since been cleared and Oberst is still dealing with the repercussions. Martinez has responded to the accusations, saying that Heller “never said no to what we chose to do together.” This is only fueling the fire from fans. People have responded to Martinez’s statement by saying that “never saying no” does not imply consent from someone, which is an important fact to point out. Some have put together the different signals of no that are not explicitly saying no. On this list are phrases like “let’s just go to sleep,” “I’m tired” and “I have a boyfriend,” which are all statements that Heller said she used when trying to defer Martinez from sexual activities.Fans have also brought up the unsettling argument that Martinez is a woman and, therefore, not as strong as a man, which means she is able to be easily pushed off by someone alleging sexual assault. This falls in line with the narratives that women cannot rape others in general and that women would never let themselves be raped by another woman, which are misconceptions. The fact of the matter is that these women have nothing to gain from their accusations. They lived through the assault, probably lived alone in their suffering for a long time and are now facing vicious backlash from fanbases. The only thing they should gain from these situations is support and the hope that these abusers may never abuse another person.\\r\\n\\r\\nmmgarbac@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'In mid-October, #MeToo, a hashtag empowering sexual assault victims to speak out, went viral on Facebook and Twitter. At that time, I wrote a column commenting on how this hashtag would be different than other social media movements and how it had the potential to lead to actual offline change.About a month and a half later, I can say with confidence that in a lot of ways, this hashtag has helped spark an adjustment in U.S. culture toward taking sexual assault seriously. The public admonishment, and in many cases, firing of powerful men such Harvey Weinstein, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, Louis C.K., Matt Lauer, and Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Michigan, is proof of this. Companies such as Massage Envy are promising to look at business practices and punishment systems to decrease the chances of sexual assault. In many ways, #MeToo did open up the conversation about sexual assault and empower victims to speak out regarding their oppressor without fear of not being taken seriously or being chastised for doing so. But there is still a long, long way to go. Yes, there have been celebrity cases in which those perpetrating sexual assault have been fired or chastised. However, there are an infinite amount of sexual assault cases that have had no light or justice shed on them. One out of six women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime.From a legislative and judicial standpoint, ensuring that those accused of sexual assault have due process and are not subject to libel in the media, but are still prosecuted appropriately for the severity of the crime is critical.For example, Brock Turner, the Stanford swimmer convicted for sexually assaulting a woman in March 2016, is appealing his conviction. In cases where sexual assault is so obvious and there are primary witnesses, punishing those found guilty severely and properly is necessary moving forward.And lastly, the fact that I even have to mention this person is exhausting, but I would be remised if I did not bring up our current commander-in-chief. The current culture in our nation is to take away power and influence from those that have been accused by multiple people of sexual assault, which is a positive adjustment. This is especially true if there is video, audio or written evidence of sexual assault culture surrounding the accused.  This new open conversation about sexual assault has completely discredited one of the nation’s most beloved morning hosts, one of Hollywood’s biggest influences and various members of the legislative branch of our government. Society is holding men of power in various different career fields to this standard of human decency. So why should our President, who meets the criteria of having multiple victims speak out and has been caught on an audio recording speaking about sexually assaultive behaviors, be exempt from all of this? The President of the United States is historically held in regard of being a moral backbone of the nation. I believe that honest legislative, judicial and executive change surrounding sexual assault cannot begin until the most powerful man in this country is chastised appropriately for his actions.\\r\\n\\r\\nccarigan@indiana.edu\\r\\n@carmesanchicken ',\n",

This choice is disrespectful toward all of the victims of assault under these directors.In 2014, Woody Allen’s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow detailed alleged sexual assault by Allen that occurred in 1992. Despite this, many extremely famous actors continue to work in his films, including Blake Lively, Steve Carell and Scarlett Johansson. His newest film, \"Wonder Wheel,\" stars Kate Winslet and Justin Timberlake. When asked why she chose to work on his film, Winslet said: “As the actor in the film, you just have to step away and say, I don\\'t know anything, really, and whether any of it is true or false. Having thought it all through, you put it to one side and just work with the person.”Winslet’s argument is incredibly popular with celebrities in defense of the people with whom they choose to work. Actor Armie Hammer was recently interviewed on the podcast \"Happy Sad Confused.\" The conversation took a turn into the current state of sexual assault in Hollywood, namely because in 2016 Hammer worked on the film \"Birth of a Nation\" with Nate Parker, a director who was accused of raping a woman who has since committed suicide. The case was not public knowledge at the time the movie was being filmed, so Hammer and the rest of the cast were unaware.After this news came out, the movie did incredibly poorly amidst the controversy. In the interview, Hammer was asked if he would ever consider working with a director like Roman Polanski, who was accused of the molestation of a 10-year-old girl. Hammer said, “The idealist in me would like to think, like, OK, I\\'m not working with Polanski the person, I\\'m working with him as an artist, and this is a new thing that he\\'s doing and I think that he is a talented artist or whatever. It’s a gray area.”Many of his fans were hurt by this statement, including myself, but, as columnist Miranda Garbaciak wrote in her Nov. 16 column, it is important to hold your favorite artists and celebrities accountable for their actions. I do not think Hammer’s statement is necessarily coming from a place of bad intentions, especially because he is not actually working with someone like Polanski. It just proves that he comes from a place of privilege and does not understand the insidious power dynamic of sexual assault in Hollywood. Hopefully, he will realize his mistake and apologize.The underlying problem with his statement is that you cannot separate Polanski the \"artist\" with Polanski the \"person.\" Polanski the \"artist” is still a rapist, and willingly working with him is incredibly disrespectful to not only Polanski’s victim, but also victims of sexual assault everywhere. The same goes for actors still working with Woody Allen – they are furthering a culture of normalized rape and sexual assault.emmagetz@indiana.edu\\r\\n@emmaagetz',\n",

       "  'body': 'Things do not always happen as they should. This is a statement for which it is so easy to find evidence that it may seem strange to pay any attention to it rather than take it for granted.We live on the third planet from the sun, we need water to survive and the world is an abundantly absurd place where mistakes are made. That I am engaging directly with such an obvious statement comes from my recent confrontation with a stunningly ridiculous reminder of just how absurd our world is.What is that reminder? Brock Turner is appealing his sexual assault conviction.The man who raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster and served only three out of the six months of his abhorrently lenient sentence somehow feels he has been mistreated.I recognize that, by the current terms of California state law, I cannot actually call Brock Turner a rapist. This technicality, however, is a mistake that causes unjust damage for victims and obstructs the justice they deserve. Turner was found guilty of three felony charges, including assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated or unconscious person, penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object and penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object.If you are confused as to how penetration with a foreign object does not actually qualify as rape, the best explanation I can offer you is that the state of California defines rape as an act of “sexual intercourse,” which necessitates in this case that the foreign object be Turner’s penis.Defining rape in this way is not only harmful to victims, but also out of date with federal standards. As of 2013, the FBI’s definition of rape is “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.” This definition more accurately encompasses the actions we ought to classify as rape, and it is with this definition in mind that I call Brock Turner a rapist. And yet, Turner feels that it is he, rather than his victim, who has suffered an injustice.Turner’s father infamously lamented that his son’s life should not be ruined for “20 minutes of action.” Judge Aaron Persky feared the “severe impact” of a longer prison sentence. It now appears that Turner has taken these sentiments to heart enough to feel justified in taking legal action. Grievances include the exclusion of testimonies from character witnesses, lack of instruction for jurors to consider lesser charges and mischaracterization of the circumstance of the assault. Turner wants it known that he assaulted his victim near a dumpster rather than behind it, because the latter description implies he was trying to hide his behavior. Let me be clear: there is no such thing as a man who is too good to be capable of rape. Jurors should not consider mild sentences for rapists. No matter where or how a rapist commits the crime, rape is rape. Rape is rape, and our definition of rape should include nonconsensual penetration of any kind so that we can provide victims with justice and predators with punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nmareklei@indiana.edu\\r\\n@mklein319',\n",

       "  'body': ' IU’s Panhellenic Association has come up with goals for their 22 chapters to achieve after the temporary suspension of unsupervised new member activity and social events with alcohol for Interfraternity Council chapters.PHA and IFC are the governing bodies of most fraternities and sororities on campus and often work together on events throughout the year. After the IFC suspension Nov. 27, leaders for PHA came together to create new expectations for PHA and IFC interactions in the future, according to a press release by PHA.This council will introduce more alcohol awareness programs for new members, have a monthly event where all chapters will pair with another Panhellenic Association chapter for a sisterhood event and standardize risk management expectations.“We hope that the long-term impact that these ideas have continue efforts focused on strengthening the connections between women in the Panhellenic community, creating safer social environments and ensuring education that is beneficial to our members,” the press release said.The council will be working with national headquarters, chapters, advisors and Student Life and Learning in order to execute these goals.Along with setting goals for PHA chapters, the council also suggested focus areas for the IFC community. This includes standardizing risk management expectations, engaging in additional education programming on topics like hazing, sexual assault awareness and appropriate alcohol usage, and co-organizing more philanthropic, scholarship and service-based events with PHA chapters each month.“In this time, the Panhellenic Association community is here to support the IFC community and work together,” PHA said in the statement. “We are fully confident in our women’s organizations to utilize this as an opportunity to strengthen ourselves internally with the ultimate objective of being a catalyst for change at Indiana University.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Editorial Board supports the Intrafraternity Council’s temporary suspension of fraternity social events and hopes this action will allow these greek organizations to direct even more of their resources towards philanthropy, campus involvement and the academic success of their members. IU joins a growing list of universities suspending fraternity activities, including Ohio State University, Ball State University and the University of Michigan. This suspension is not just because, as one student tweeted, IU is “jealous” of their “fun.” The Editorial Board refuses to label the community that has nationally produced rates of sexual assault four times higher amongst sorority members than amongst other non-affiliated women as “fun.” The principles of life espoused by IU’s fraternities — virtue, truth, discipline, charity, morality and purity, among others — were obviously lacking at the Penn State fraternity party that resulted in Tim Piazza’s alcohol-related death and led to 1,098 recommended criminal charges against 18 former members and the fraternity itself. The alleged hazing and drug use that led to Phi Kappa Psi’s suspension and the sexual assault allegation that led to Alpha Tau Omega’s suspension, while not fatal, are still symptomatic of the sickness afflicting fraternities on campus and across the nation. As IU junior Colin Shassberger writes in a letter to the Indianapolis Star, “A suspension doesn’t stop rape culture. It doesn’t stop the promotion of binge drinking and substance abuse. It doesn’t stop the spread of toxic masculinity, sexism and homophobia.” If these problems exist in our fraternities — and the Editorial Board believes they do — a suspension only delays the reemergence of these grave issues. Unfortunately, even direct interventions designed to reduce alcohol consumption in fraternities may have little efficacy. According to a 2016 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Health Psychology, “Greek letter organizations consume higher quantities of alcohol, report more frequent drinking and experience more alcohol-related consequences relative to non-greek peers.” After interventions designed to reduce alcohol consumption, they also “drank no less and reported no fewer alcohol-related problems,” though did see a slight decrease in quantity of alcohol consumed per week or month. The study suggests five reasons why fraternities are so resistant to changing their alcohol-related habits. Fraternity brothers are more likely to misperceive social norms associated with alcohol use, socialized in environments where alcohol misuse is likely to be rewarded and more likely to have positive expectations about alcohol consumption. The fact fraternities are off-campus and often unsupervised also allows alcohol consumption to go unregulated and underreported. And lastly, students who have preexisting histories of heavy alcohol use are simply more likely to be drawn into the Greek communities demonstrating similar drinking habits. These are the factors, among others, that must be addressed during this suspension if the IFC genuinely wants to improve its greek community and not just wag its finger at them until the Feb. 28 expiration.IU’s fraternities have been given an opportunity to thoughtfully reassess the priorities of their brotherhoods and the Editorial Board suggests that they make use of it. For the other 82 percent of IU students who aren’t directly involved in greek life, here’s a simple way to help get the message across: when those inevitable invitations to some questionably-themed ragers are sent out this March? Don’t go.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Dictionary.com released Monday that its word of the year is complicit.The word complicit is defined as “choosing to be involved in an illegal or questionable act, especially with others; having partnership or involvement in wrongdoing.”Dictionary.com stated that 2017 has been defined by those on the wrong and right sides of being complicit. And as many can agree, 2017 seemed to be the year of lacking accountability, pervasiveness of immaturity, and a disposition of looking the other way when something wrong is happening.In a negative sense, being complicit has the connotation of being a bystander or turning the other cheek on immoral acts. For example, the fallout from the 2016 election, the investigations of both the Trump and Clinton campaigns for election meddling and fraud has led to a large amount of top-ranking government officials exposed as complicit in illegal activities both within the United States and other countries. Other examples of complicity include the president’s lack of admonishment toward the organizers and participants of the Charlottesville, Virginia, rallies. Another example is Congress pushing a health care act that would systematically disenfranchise the lives of many lower- and middle-class citizens.In addition, pushing harmful social norms, such as unrealistic female body image and a lack of serious punishment for sexual assault all fall into the bucket of complicity. It seems the root of complicity can be traced to a lack of responsibility or ownership of one’s action. Being complicit requires a shirking of accountability or duty to other people because it is easier or provides personal gain. For a proper democracy to work, citizens have to care about one another and be held accountable for their actions. Not only political leaders but every citizen needs to stand up against illegal or immoral acts. That’s why in 2018 the word of the year our society should aim to reflect is “unite.” The definition of unite is to “come or bring together for a common purpose or action,” particularly in a political context. Uniting with others requires a maturity from both leaders and common citizens that 2017 has lacked. It requires us to have empathy for other people, be willing to consider different opinions and act not just for ourselves but for the common good. The positive stands in 2017 against complicity already show unification. For example, the #MeToo movement stands against complicity in sexual assault. The recent November elections, which resulted in the first transgender and Sikh candidates being elected to their respective offices, show a movement against complicity in white male candidates owning a large part of what is supposed to be a representative government. As Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, said in his resignation, “Silence can equal complicity.” In an era where the nation may feel more divided than ever, it is on us as citizens to mobilize and link up with other people for a common cause. This is necessary to fix our nation’s ills moving forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nccarigan@indiana.edu\\r\\n@carmesanchicken',\n",

       "  'body': \"Cyntoia Brown is a 29-year-old woman who 13 years ago was sentenced to life for murdering the man who abducted her and trafficked her for involuntary sex work. She is currently serving her sentence in Tennessee, but thanks to social media, the case has regained national attention. Many celebrities as well as the general public are rallying behind Brown and saying her sentence is too severe given her circumstances and age. Editorial Board agrees. When the system already fails so many who report rape and sexual abuse, it is no surprise that a 16-year-old victim of sex trafficking was sentenced to such a harsh punishment for escaping her horrific situation.Lawyers for Brown said if she were tried under current Tennessee law, she would receive a charge of second degree murder at most.Thirteen years of Brown’s life have been spent in prison. Her adolescent years were first robbed by a pimp and second by the system that was supposed to protect her. At 16, Brown began living with a 43-year-old named Johnny Mitchell Allen, who goes by the alias “Kut-throat.” Kut-throat let several men drug and rape her, and then he eventually sold her to a child predator for sex. Brown said that one night the two got into bed together, and she saw Allen reach under the bed. Fearing that he was reaching for a gun, she also grabbed a gun and proceeded to shoot him.Cyntoia Brown, after living in fear with continued abuse, finally protected herself – and is now being punished to the highest degree for it. Not only does the criminal justice system treat victims of sex crimes unjustly, it allows perpetrators to get off easy.Two years ago Brock Allen Turner was tried and convicted on three counts of felony sexual assault. After the trial, he was charged with assault with attempt to rape, rape of an intoxicated person with a foreign object and rape of an unconscious person with a foreign object. Two strangers passing by a college party witnessed Turner on top of a woman behind a dumpster. The two called the police and pulled Turner off of the woman and held him until authorities arrived. Although Turner's charges typically carry at least a 14 year prison sentence, prosecutors only asked for a six year moderate sentence in county jail. Turner actually received a six month sentence in county jail followed by three months of probation. But Turner only served three months in jail before being released. Turner forced himself upon an intoxicated, unconscious woman behind a dumpster and has a lighter sentence than a survivor of sexual abuse and trafficking. In the midst of the Harvey Weinstein allegations, the Woody Allen allegations and the Louis C.K. admittance of sexual misconduct, it is no secret that society, including our government officials, does not take sexual assault seriously.Thirteen women have come forward intending to press charges against our own president, on top of many video and audio accounts of him discussing his abusive behavior toward women. CNN published an incomplete list of powerful men who have been accused of sexual assault – all of them still walking free with their money, their fame and negligable consequences for their actions. Meanwhile a 29-year old is serving a life sentence for killing her rapist, her pimp, her abuser. Our prison system is failing those it was supposed to protect. While it would be hard to escape a sentence at all for murder, Brown, a minor at the time, should never have been sentenced to a life behind bars.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"A Brooklyn teenager who accused two NYPD detectives of sexually assaulting her in September has now divulged an account of city police officers intimidating her out of pressing charges.The Editorial Board finds this type of behavior from those who claim to “serve and protect” utterly indefensible. This occurrence is an acute example of why many victims of rape or sexual assault do not come forward with their accusations.Additionally, this kind of action from a police force drives a larger wedge between law enforcement and the communities they serve.The accuser, Anna Chambers, claims multiple officers came into her hospital room while she was seeking a rape kit the night of the alleged rape. They repeatedly tried to convince her that the men she was accusing were not real police officers, and that she should drop all charges.In reality, the two men Chambers has accused are NYPD detectives Eddie Martins and Richard Hall. They admitted to having had sex with Chambers on the night she sought the rape kit, but claimed it was consensual.They have pled not guilty to their indictment, but have resigned from the NYPD.Police officers and detectives are supposed to exist to protect the communities in which they are placed. Allegedly raping a teenager in one such community is already inexcusable, but the intimidation of that teenager afterward is adding insult to injury.Any attempt from anyone to convince a victim of rape or sexual assault out of reporting that offense cannot be tolerated. By the same token, placing pressure on a victim to get him or her to report is also not advisable. It should be at the discretion of the alleged victim and no one else, whether or not to report the offense. Everyone deals with trauma differently, and stepping in to intimidate someone into a decision does nothing to help the traumatic situation.The police officers involved in Chambers’ hospital room intimidation should step down like their detective colleagues. They not only rejected their responsibility to serve and protect citizens, but also displayed little to no empathy for a woman who had just undergone a distressing situation.Chambers' claims of intimidation bring up intersection of two major subjects in the realm of law enforcement: community trust and the propensity sexual assault reporting.The police have long since been under fire for their fostering of poor relationships within their communities. The shooting of Michael Brown at the hands of a police officer in Ferguson ignited a nationwide conversation about whether or not constituents can trust the very people who are entrusted to protect them. The numerous accounts of police brutality at the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that followed Ferguson complicated the conversation about the role of law enforcement. Intimidation of a potential rape victim only hurts the image of police. It also adds to the list of reasons a rape victim may have not reported or tried to bring their accused to justice. The recent influx of sexual harassment and assault accusations has brought a lot of empowerment to victims of these crimes. But, it has also brought skepticism about the validity of the accusations. Women and men who have experienced sexual violence may feel discouraged about reporting their experience for fear that other people —like family, friends or even strangers online— may not believe them.The idea that the people they might be reporting to would not believe them is even worse.Police officers have a responsibility to serve and protect their communities, regardless of whether their colleagues are the ones they need to protect against.We all have a responsibility as humans to respect and support those who come forward about sexual violence. \",\n",

       "  'body': \"This past Friday, the former guitar tech of the band Brand New posted on Facebook asking why people haven’t outed frontman Jesse Lacey yet. He received reports of the singer's misconduct and multiple responses from people who felt uncomfortable being around him. One in particular stood out from the rest and stirred the pot Friday evening. One victim responded, saying Lacey solicited nudes from her while she was 15 and he was 24. She also says that he made her watch him masturbate on Skype, similar to the allegations made against Louis C.K. As a self-proclaimed die-hard fan of Brand New, this was absolutely heart-wrenching and infuriating to watch unfold. It's not because I was mad this was happening to my favorite band, but because someone I idolized so much throughout my teen years was capable of perpetuating the cycle of sexual violence.My feelings about this event lead me to a conclusion I think is very important for any media consumer to consider: survivors will always value my support a thousand times more than a band, artist or celebrity ever will. There will always be fans who support a band no matter what happens, and this was proven Friday when people brushed off the accusations on Twitter and other social media outlets. Users said the victim was lying or they demanded proof. Others brought up other situations where musicians were falsely accused.On Saturday, Lacey addressed the situation in a statement on Facebook. While mentioning the accusations, he failed to mention the part about the victim being underage and focused the statement on his suffering and what he has been through.While it's good that he made an apology and confirmed that the allegations are true, this is insufficient. Often, we receive apologies about sexual assault after the perpetrators have been outed. These apologies do not feel genuine. They feel as if they exist solely to make the abusers feel better about themselves.In the heat of all of this, I was faced with something I can’t necessarily call a problem or a dilemma. It was more a check of my own morals. Whenever a rapper, actor or director is outed as an abuser, we shout that our lives will be better off without their work in it. As a longtime fan of Brand New, I want to repeat that survivors will always need more support more than a band will. Our “faves” aren’t exempt from justice and they aren’t exempt from the same treatment we give people like Kevin Spacey, Harvey Weinstein and Johnny Depp.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey should be held just as accountable.\\r\\n\\r\\nmmgarbac@indiana.edu\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Speakers at a panel at the Monroe County Public Library on Monday afternoon discussed the violent causes of the Central American Migrant Crisis and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.Guadalupe Pimentel, one of the founders of the Indiana Undocumented Youth Alliance, said the panel was meant to shed light on the reality of undocumented immigration in the United States today.“We won’t see change until we start calling things as they are,” she said.One of the panelists was Ramón Marquez, the director of one of the largest migrant shelters in Mexico, La 72.He said La 72 housed 1,296 migrants in 2016, but he estimates the number will jump to 20,000 in 2017. In the last six years, he said they have received more than 75,000, most of whom are families, women, unaccompanied minors and LGBT individuals.A decade ago, he said most migrants were men looking for better economic opportunities. He said the situation has now changed entirely.“This is a whole different problem,” he said. “This is children fleeing violence.”Marquez said migrants from Central America, including these children and families, leave their homes for survival. He said they are only trying to escape from violence from gangs and organized criminal groups.He said initiatives like the Southern Border Program that try to keep these people out of the U.S. try to legitimize violence, crimes and violations of human rights that result in assaults, sexual violence, kidnappings, disappearances and killings.“They chase them, and they hunt them like animals,” he said.Pimentel also pointed to the cruelty of the funnel effect, which involved the U.S. government increasing border patrol in some areas in the 1990s in order to funnel immigrant traffic to Arizona’s inhospitable deserts and mountain areas.A 2016 study by the Binational Migration Institute estimated the funnel effect resulted in deaths of between 2,000 to 3,000 people.Pimentel said the cruelty against undocumented immigrants doesn’t stop at the border.After hearing about House Bill 1402, which passed in 2011 and barred undocumented students from qualifying for in-state tuition, Pimentel worked with Sayra Campos, another founder of Indiana Undocumented Youth Alliance, to protest.Campos said they demanded a meeting with then-Gov. Mitch Daniels. When he would not meet with them, she said they stayed outside his office until they were arrested.Five undocumented students protested, and all of them were detained before being released hours later, Pimentel said.“We were not going to be silent,” Pimentel said.Campos said immigration efforts in their favor, including the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act and DACA, were the result of students like the five of them who took a stand.“We got DACA because of students who pushed for it,” she said. “We worked for it.”She said the repeal of DACA was a wake-up call for students to stand up again.Pimentel said she wants more than just immigration reform to help undocumented students who were brought to the U.S. as children. She wants her entire family to be protected.“We won’t throw the rest of our family under the bus,” she said.But most of all, she said she wants people to have faith in their communities rather than immigration laws that can be thrown out in the future.“The hope we once placed in pieces of legislation, we now place in our community,” she said.',\n",

However, any societal discussion of sexual assault that avoids victim-blaming destigmatizes the topic and encourages survivors to come forward with their experiences, Waller said.“I do know for a fact that the more survivors that come out and speak up about their experiences, the more survivors will feel safe and not alone to do the same thing,\" Waller said. \"Whether that is at Middle Way House or with a trusted friend or family member.” Even though more survivors have shared their stories after allegations against Harvey Weinstein and others surfaced, Waller said coming out with their stories might not be the best option for all survivors if they don\\'t feel comfortable or safe doing so.\"We also do not advocate that all survivors of domestic or sexual violence go to the police or go through with filing charges if they do not want to or have other issues that may make doing this difficult or cause more problems,\" Waller said.Middle Way House works under an empowerment model, offering resources to survivors to let them make informed decisions on what their best path might be, Waller said.“We know that a person knows their experience and life best,\" Waller said. \"We do our best to make sure a person has all they need to make an informed decision for themselves.” Middle Way House has three legal advocates, including Heather Davis, who provide legal counseling to clients. Davis said in an email interview that the advocates attend court hearings with their clients, help them file divorce papers and protective orders and give them attorney referrals if necessary.However, Davis said the biggest problem they face is finding their clients legal representation because there are only a few places in town that provide pro-bono work.\"When their case loads are full (and they fill up quickly) it is very hard to find our clients representation for either their divorce or protective order hearings,\" Davis said in an email interview.According to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey’s 2010-2012 state report, an estimated half million people were victims of contact sexual violence by a current or former partner. The NIPSVS defines contact sexual violence as “a combined measure that includes rape, being made to penetrate someone else, sexual coercion and/or unwanted sexual contact,” and estimates almost a million annual victims in Indiana between 2010 and 2012.Waller said sexual assault can occur in different kinds of relationships in a person’s life. The perpetrator could be anyone from a partner or family member to a friend or acquaintance. The nature of every case determines the best path of action for each survivor.Waller said healing from sexual violence is “long, complicated and can be very emotionally and physically exhausting.” For Middle Way House, the best way to support survivors is to believe their stories, despite personal perceptions of the person accused Waller said.“The only way that survivors can be safe and empowered to seek out help when it comes to sexual violence is by knowing that the people around them and the people they go to will believe their story no matter what, and trust that the choices they make for their life are the right ones,” Waller said.Davis said something anyone can do to help survivors is to listen, be empathetic and show compassion.\"Listening really does go a long way and means a lot to a survivor,\" Davis said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Comedian Louis C.K. on November 9, 2017 admitted to sexual misconduct, consisting of masturbating and exposing himself in front of women. This came after the New York Times published the allegations of five women. Sexual harassment or misconduct allegations should not require an exposé by major networks in order to be taken seriously. They should be taken seriously when they start. The allegations against Louis C.K. are not new. In 2015, Gawker published rumors about C.K.’s sexual harassment allegations. Comedian Roseanne Barr, in an interview with the Daily Beast in 2016, said rumors like these are common in the comedy circuit, as did comedian Jen Kirkman, who mentioned the rumors about C.K. on her podcast “I Seem Fun.”The comedy circuit seemed to know there were rumors linking C.K. and sexual misconduct for a long time.A comparable situation is occurring with the former USA Gymnastics’ doctor Larry Nassar. Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney said Nassar sexually abused her starting at the age of 13.And Maroney is not the only one. Nassar is currently facing 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and 11 counts of third-degree criminal sexual accounts. This abuse continued in USA Gymnastics. In 2013, a case in Georgia claimed USA Gymnastics was negligent for allowing coach William McCabe to continue coaching after receiving four prior sexual abuse complaints, which have now been reported to the police. This was a widespread problem with USA Gymnastics. Two former officials of the program admitted under oath that if the organization received reports about a coach’s sexual misconduct from other coaches, it was routinely ignored unless it had the victim’s signature. This prevents an investigation from even occurring, which leads to cases like former coach Mark Schiefelbein, who was charged with molesting a 10-year-old girl. When a case was filed, a subpoena of USA Gymnastics revealed multiple complaints of sexual misconduct. When these scandals become big, a common question is why the accusers never came out before. Why are they only doing it now that there is a story to latch onto?  From a baseline view, this appears valid until you realize that these floating rumors, complaints and reports have all existed for years and were simply brushed off. While these are famous cases, ignoring allegations isn’t something just famous people do. Most of my friends have talked about that one creepy guy that no one wants around because he always makes inappropriate comments or takes things too far. I would bet that in addition to “that guy,” most people also know someone that brushes sexually inappropriate behavior off because the person doing it is deemed a nice guy or part of the friend group.So in the end, it doesn’t surprise me that these scandalous reports start a snowball effect with more allegations. Because no one listens to us separately, maybe the only way to get traction is after a New York Times exposé. npatwari@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Dr. Debby Herbenick is a sex educator and researcher. She is currently the Director for the Center for Sexual Health Promotion, author of the Kinsey Confidential column and a professor who teaches human sexuality at IU. She hosts the Bloomington Sex Salon and was as a co-producer for the Netflix documentary, \"Hot Girls Wanted.\"  Her research focuses on creating a better understanding of how contemporary women and men experience their sexual lives. Herbenick spoke to the IDS about her research, the Kinsey Confidential column and sexuality in the United States. Indiana Daily Student: Could you talk about your background and how you got into sex research? Herbenick: I did my undergrad at the University of Maryland and I studied psychology and child development, and when I graduated college, the Kinsey Institute was doing research on child and adolescent sexual development. So, even though I hadn’t studied sex before, it was interesting to me because of the child and adolescent piece, and I started working there and realized how little I knew, at the time, about sexuality, how little most of my friends knew about sexuality, and I wanted to stay and keep learning more. So I stayed at IU, and I went back to grad school and I learned about public health and sexual behavior and sexual health, and became a sexual educator and researcher. IDS: Do you have a favorite study you\\'ve worked on?Herbenick: We’ve done a lot. My team has published more than 100 scientific studies on sexuality. I think some of my favorites are — one was about exercise-induced orgasm. So this experience that some people have, about 10 percent of men and women have, of having orgasms while they do certain kinds of exercises that are really difficult for their core abdominal muscles. So, lots of crunches or pull ups and crunches, or pull ups and chin ups, things like that, but also running, if you do it for long enough. And so, we were the first people to publish a study on that. It was interesting to me because it was just so unknown, and so there was a lot that we could be curious about and investigate. And then I’ve done a lot of research on how men and women feel about their genitals, so genital self-image and through some of that work, a friend and colleague and I wrote a book about vulvas and vaginas called “Read my Lips.” It was all about vulvar and vaginal health and sexual pleasure, as well as vulvar crafting ideas in every chapter. So those have been really fun, but probably what we’re most known for are these very large-scale studies of sexual behavior in the United States.IDS: You were a co-producer for the Netflix documentary \"Hot Girls Wanted,\" what was that experience like?Herbenick: So what my colleague and I in the media school did as co-producers was really provide research to the film, so we weren’t involved in the filmmaking, but that was our role. So we provided research information to the directors and the producers, and it was just fascinating to understand more about how documentary films are made, to get to talk with filmmakers about their process. And we’ve still worked with them. They had a follow-up Netflix series called “Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,” which is a series of episodes about the intersections of sex and technology and we also provided, we actually did a whole new study just for that series that looked at issues of sex and technology or news and sexually explicit media. IDS: Why is it important to publish information about sex, like the Kinsey Confidential column? Herbenick: I think it’s really important that student newspapers, in general, publish fact-based information about sex. Like I said, when I graduated from college and first came to Kinsey as a research assistant at the time, it was eye-opening how much of what I thought I knew was wrong. I teach human sexuality here at IU, and I find that most of my students have never had much sex education in school. If they have, it’s just been limited to a few days, and that’s typical for Americans everywhere. There’s not a lot of sex ed. So I think that’s why it’s important. You know, we only answer one or two questions every column, so it’s not an enormous amount, but it’s consistent and it’s regular, and more than that, I think it normalizes sex too. It’s a completely normal topic that you could find in your newspaper, no different than reading about sports or reading about current events, and it signals to students that there are resources for them here on campus, whether it’s the health center, or the School of Public Health, human sexuality classes or a range of other sex classes throughout the departments on campus where they can learn about sexuality.IDS: Could you talk a little bit about the Bloomington Sex Salon?Herbenick: They’ll start back up in December. I took a few months off with having a baby. I love the Bloomington Sex Salon. So yeah, I started this a few years ago, after realizing what amazing conversations I had with my friends who were fellow researchers and educators, and just because I know a lot about sex and I study what I study, doesn’t mean that I know everything about sex. So I have friends and colleagues who study things that I don’t know, and when I get together with them over lunch or coffee, I ask them about their work and they tell me things that I learn about and that are interesting. And so it occurred to me that, wouldn’t it be cool if we basically did this in a public setting, and other people could benefit from that. So, the style of the Bloomington Sex Salon is that it’s held in public, off-campus spaces, usually a bar, and almost always the Bishop. We’ve tried a few other ones, but the Bishop works the best for us. And so, it’s 18 plus, and you don’t have to drink, but there are drinks available for people who want to buy beer, wine or alcohol, or water. And they can hang out, and watch two people talk about sex. And so the first 30-40 minutes is just me asking questions of whoever the guest is that month, and then the next 20-30 minutes is audience Q&A. It’s very casual – we invite people who are comfortable talking about sex in real ways, not sort of ivory tower academic theory ways, not that that’s not interesting, but that’s not what this is. This is about bridging conversations with the community. We’ve had great, great people. We’ve had a lot of IU faculty, we’ve had professors from other schools, like Emory University, come in. We’ve had Dr. Ruth, who is a very famous sex educator, who is in her 80s now. We’ve had Annie Sprinkle, who is a performance artist and former porn actress and former sex worker. We’ve had the filmmakers from \"Hot Girls Wanted\" and New York Times best-selling authors, and just a really interesting range of people. Photographers, sex educators, so it’s fun and it’s free, and they start back up in December. IDS: Do you think there\\'s a stigma surrounding sex in the United States?Herbenick: Yes, overwhelming yes. And it’s hard, right? Because in some ways, people talk about sex frequently. There’s been a lot about sex in the newspaper because of the Harvey Weinstein stuff. So people write, like in the newspapers and blogs, and talk pretty frequently about harmful sex, predatory sex, illegal sex. There’s been no shortage in the conversation about sexual assault, but what I think every student and every person who cares about these issues should ask themselves is: are we getting a balance about healthy sexuality? For every article about sexual assault – which is important, every Harvey Weinstein article has been important to document that these things really happen, and they happen more often than we talk about – but how much are we getting about sexual pleasure, sexual communication, sexual education in schools, helpful information for parents to talk to their kids about sex, helpful information for older people to figure out sex as they have health problems or lose a partner to death or having to go into an assisted living center. There’s all these parts of like the normal, healthy spectrum of sexuality that we’re not talking openly about. But we talk about predatory sex, illegal sex, and we talk about sensational sex. We see no shortage of sexual imagery among the Kardashians. You can turn on the TV or you’re looking through YouTube, and you can see all kinds of titillating sex – and that’s fine, that has a place, the scary warning stories have a place – but where we struggle as a society is everything kind of in between.

       "  'body': 'It is no secret that a sexual predator currently occupies the highest political office in this country.However, while President Trump remains unpunished for his offenses, forthcoming legislation gives reason to hope sexual misconduct may soon be taken more seriously within the House and Senate.Building off the momentum generated by the #MeToo trend made popular on Twitter last month and originally created by Tarana Burke in 2007, some members of Congress hope to use what has become a moment of national attention to fuel change. While legislation benefitting the public sphere is still essential, bills like the ones recently proposed are also necessary. They offer refreshing examples of dedicated public servants who deserve full support in a time of ever increasing national unrest. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, and Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, each made separate announcements Friday of bills they said they hope will change the way the Hill handles harassment. Gillibrand, who has a history of campaigning for the reform of sexual assault policies, is stepping up for the cause once again with a well-founded bill. Provisions of the bill include: eliminating the 30-day period of mediation that is currently a prerequisite for simply filing a complaint, designating a position within the Office of Compliance to serve as a resource and advocating for victims and requiring interns to have access to all resources available to full-time staff. Given that mediation periods usually end in confidential settlements taken from a designated U.S. Treasury fund — rather than the office of the accused, as it should be — Gillibrand’s bill would enable reporting staffers to better pursue justice for themselves and expose their violators. Since this greater freedom to report comes with greater guidance under the Office of Compliance, interns, who are traditionally intimidated into thinking they will sabotage their careers, will be better protected in particular.Speier has a history of advocacy as well, and her most recent bill requires annual anti-harassment training for all employees as well as the execution of a survey designed to capture the true scope of what she and others feel is a rampant issue. Training may at first seem unhelpful, but sexual misconduct can take many forms and a clear delineation of those forms can help either to discourage their execution or to guard against excuses of ignorance from accused parties. These bills are important and deserve implementation in some form, because, legislative action to reform sexual assault laws has been egregiously overdue for some time now. Watershed moments surrounding figures like Harvey Weinstein should not be necessary for our lawmakers to act on such a serious issue as sexual assault, but I am grateful in this instance that anything is happening at all. There is one important, though somewhat cliché, thing to remember as Congress moves forward with the consideration of these bills: public engagement. Midterm elections are coming up in November of 2018, and public discourse should absolutely make clear that senators and representatives wishing to gain or retain their seat need to support legislation such as that proposed by Gillibrand and Speier. It is absolutely time to move forward with such reforms and support them in whatever means possible, so let’s get going.\\r\\n\\r\\nmareklei@indiana.edu\\r\\n@foreverfloral97',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Indiana Daily Student prides itself on its 150 years of independent journalism. We pride ourselves so much for it that it’s at the top of our website.Editorial independence gives us the protection to write stories that matter to students, such as how the University handles sexual assault cases, the understaffing of Counseling and Psychological Services and everything in between without oversight from the University.However, the Media School has started to make significant overreaching decisions that are threatening the independence of the IDS. This has all come to a head with this week’s forced early resignation of our newsroom adviser and Director of Student Media Ron Johnson. Per our IU Student Media charter, signed by former University Chancellor Ken Gros Louis in 2005, the IDS and Arbutus yearbook are student-run organizations with a director appointed by the dean of the School of Journalism. But because they are student-run, all final decisions come down to the editor-in-chief.What students had no input on, though, was the “resignation” of Johnson, and what would come next.For this academic year, Johnson took a 10 percent pay cut so the IDS could have a little more money. When that wasn’t enough, Johnson announced his resignation effective Jan. 1, 2018, so his salary, of which the IDS pays 75 percent, could continue funding the Daily Student’s operations.But for Media School Dean James Shanahan, Johnson’s departure wasn’t fast enough. The dean asked Johnson — with no warning or time to deliberate — to move his resignation date to Dec. 1, 2017. When he did not give a satisfactory answer, Johnson said, the dean decided that Dec. 1 would be the date — a month earlier than planned.What sounds like a simple change of plans by a month speaks volumes to students, staff and alumni.Shanahan would not discuss the specifics of the decision, but he said it was purely financial. “The situation really is based out of financial consideration here,” Shanahan said in an interview with IDS editor-in-chief Jamie Zega. “We need to be able to move a little more quickly than is being moved right now.”The IDS, like many other professional and student media outlets, is in the midst of a financial challenge. We’re not making the money we used to, and like other forms of legacy media, we’re scrambling to make up the difference.Johnson, however, saw our financial woes coming and informed the dean of the need to cut production to twice a week during the 2015-16 school year.The dean didn’t want to cause more concern among School of Journalism alumni in his first semester as dean and quashed that idea.Johnson is not purely to blame for this financial situation, nor should he be punished for it.No one is solely responsible for the economic struggle of an entire industry. In the coming days, Shanahan said he will be releasing the name of the interim director of student media.The professional staff of the IDS, which includes Johnson, and student staff were not notified of the official decision to hire an interim until the dean told the editor-in-chief in an interview for this letter. Until an interim director has been hired, the dean said he cannot say definitively what a permanent replacement would look like. But he did say students would have some form of say. “I like student input,” Shanahan said. “The last thing I would want is to have a student presence that’s just symbolic or a token.”Without consultation from students, any decision made regarding the Indiana Daily Student would be far overreaching the bounds of our freedom from administrative oversight. Along with the change in director, it is also possible the dean will revisit the now-semi-antiquated charter of the IDS, which stipulates that the dean of the now-defunct School of Journalism is to appoint a director.That charter came from an alliance with Gros Louis, who fiercely believed in freedom of the press.In Gros Louis’ death, though, there came a need for a new advocate for student media. If our charter is revised on terms made by administrators with students’ “best interests” in mind, we could go from a dean simply moving the director’s resignation date up a month to eventual loss of independence from the University.That can’t happen.It can’t happen for a number of reasons. For one, the IDS is a historically high-achieving publication in the Associated Collegiate Press, Columbia Scholastic Press Association and Hearst Writing Competition. We are a recruiting tool for the Media School, and the success of the IDS, for better or worse, makes IU, the Media School and Shanahan himself look good. “I’m supportive of the good and the great journalism that’s always done at IDS,” Shanahan said. “That has always been a hallmark, but what would happen if we lost that hallmark, if we don’t address these financial issues?”But without independence — which Shanahan says he supports — we can’t bring you, our readers, the stories you need. We are not the University’s personal public relations firm, and we have to write stories that matter. A lot of our independence rides on “if”s. But we need allies now. We need the support from you, readers, to ensure that the IDS stays independent.Subscribe to our emails. Share the stories you like. As always, please provide feedback or comments. In our charter, our mission is “to inform and enlighten the Bloomington campus community and to contribute to and enrich an atmosphere of free inquiry, expression and discussion.”We exist as a news organization to serve you, our readers.

       "  'body': 'Amid allegations of sexual assault and a surprise coming-out story from Kevin Spacey, Netflix has decided to pull the plug on its original series \"House of Cards.\"It is incredible Netflix has canceled a critically-acclaimed show, but this is what should be expected of mega corporations when such frightening allegations are made against stars of television shows. There is more to this cancellation than Spacey’s allegations, though. It appears Netflix could have used Spacey\\'s allegations as a more PR-friendly reason to cancel \"House of Cards.\"Apparently, Netflix made the decision to end the show after its sixth season months ago. This may just be a convenient occasion for Netflix officials to announce the end of the show. Since its original announcement Oct. 30, Netflix has modified its statement to say production is suspended indefinitely. The decision to suspend production now is wiser than pushing through to release the sixth and final season. By releasing the final season, Netflix would be advertising the message that it values the money from streams of the last season of the show more than it condemns alleged violent actions of its actors. In all reality, Netflix has canceled its shows for lesser reasons. While it was shocking to hear that \"House of Cards\" was getting canceled, one must remember the shows Netflix canceled this summer, such as \"Sense8\" and \"The Get Down.\" These shows contained incredible diversity and ingenuity. They were canceled because they were costing the company too much money, and it couldn’t afford to carry on.\"House of Cards\" reportedly cost Netflix approximately $60 million per season, making it the fifth most expensive show on Netflix. The most recent season of \"House of Cards\" had the lowest score on Rotten Tomatoes at 69 percent, compared to the fourth season\\'s rating of 88 percent. Netflix has budgeted over $6 billion for its upcoming original series in the next year, even though it is supposedly $4.8 billion in debt. Netflix CFO David Wells justified the move by saying the company used to be “project-constrained” and did not worry about its budget. However, it would like to make its content more \"budget-constrained\" moving forward.Perhaps the combination of Spacey’s actions, the cost of each season and falling ratings are what lead to the cancellation of the show. It would be a show of solidarity for sexual assault victims if his alleged actions alone were what motivated Netflix to cancel the show. However, the other factors in play suggest the actions were just something convenient it could use as a good PR move. mmgarbac@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Broadway and television actor Anthony Rapp came forward Sunday night with a statement about how Kevin Spacey allegedly sexually assaulted him at age 14. Spacey’s response completely deflected the initial claim, saying he was probably drunk, and then used the opportunity to come out as gay. While the situation is quite nuanced, Spacey’s actions are incredibly harmful to Rapp, the LGBT community and all survivors of sexual assault – specifically those who are underage.Spacey’s first deflection in his apology was that he was drunk and does not remember the encounter. This is absolutely unacceptable and in no way excuses underage sexual assault. His second deflection was that he was closeted and has chosen now to come out as gay.In using his apology as an opportunity to come out as a gay man, Spacey tried to distract attention away from his assault and change the media focus to the fact that he is gay. While it is sad he had to spend the majority of his life in the closet, his strategic statement undervalues his horrific actions and simultaneously conflates it with being gay, which paints the entire LGBT community in a bad light. Gay men already fight against the stigma of being predatory, and Spacey’s actions lead directly to this stigmatization. His sexuality is irrelevant to the situation, and he has carefully acted so he faces as little accountability as possible. Author Mark Harris tweeted, “Coming out is a beautiful part of being gay. Attaching it to this vileness is so wrong.”Rapp, an openly gay man himself, has been an extremely outspoken activist for the LGBT community throughout his career.  After Rapp’s statement, others have come forward claiming they knew about Spacey’s actions. For example, literary agent Connor Goldsmith tweeted, “One of the very first things I was told as a young gay man working in media, nearly a decade ago, was that Kevin Spacey preys on teen boys.” Spacey holds an immense amount of power in Hollywood. He has starred in many films and TV shows, even hosting the 2017 Tony Awards. Rapp does not hold the same kind of power and influence as Spacey. While he is very famous in the Broadway world and currently stars in \"Star Trek: Discovery,\" he is overall much less well-known than Spacey. Many fans of Spacey immediately rejected Rapp’s statement, evidenced by the replies to Rapp\\'s tweet. Some people suggest Rapp does not remember, is lying for attention or is jealous of Spacey’s career. This is a sad but true representation of what sexual assault victims go through when they come forward.Rapp is an inspiration to his fans, the LGBT community and people in general.Coming forward about his assault was an act of courage, and above all else, his voice should be amplified in this situation.emmagetz@indiana.edu\\r\\n@emmaagetz',\n",

It appears that some male bloggers have a problem with it, such as Tim Falletti, blogger for ChicagoNow\\'s Acrimonious Clown.I feel if women want to wear sexy costumes, they should, and that if people have a problem with these costumes, then they should stop placing a women’s worth into what she wears. Falletti opens his argument against “slutty costumes” with “coming from a man...”This already harms his argument. Most women do not solely choose their outfits to please men. A woman could choose a sexy costume to have fun with her friends, feel good about herself or, hell, pick up a significant other if she wants. But that is her choice, and she shouldn’t police herself based off of one man’s opinion. He wants women to show respect for themselves. However, Falletti shows no respect for women who wear a sexy costume. He says it leads to them contracting syphilis and calls them unimaginative. And if it was just one jealous male blogger I would have been mad, but this also seems to be a trend. Margot Robbie, an Australian actress , said she “never got slutty costumes” and commented on how during her first Halloween in the United States, “all the other women were dressed in lingerie.” Robbie may not have been trying to slut-shame, but the word slutty is demeaning enough as it is. Slut has been used to negatively describe women for having sex since the 15th century, and even after the feminist movement of the 1970s, this term has been focused more on women than on men. And while there have been attempts to reclaim the word for women, the surrounding problems with intersectionality and diversity make this a difficult battle. The trend of demonizing sexy costumes becomes even worse when it is used to justify sexual assault. Mayim Bialik, an actress in the \"Big Bang Theory,\" stated she “always made conservative choices as a young actress.” Bialik said as a non-traditional looking woman in Hollywood, she has always been overlooked by the predators in her industry, compared to the girls who were societally-accepted as \"prettier\" and dressed less conservatively. She addresses that young women may feel that not wearing what they want is oppressive, but maintains that is simply the way of the world. However, it does not need to be the way of the world. If men like Falletti and women like Bialik can all come together and support women in their agency, we wouldn\\'t need to have conversations like this.A sexy costume is just another piece of clothing.  And yet women who choose to wear them are seen as less valuable than women who dress more conservatively.Halloween costumes are meant to be fun. Instead of demeaning people who choose to wear sexy costumes, we should acknowledge it is just a costume. A woman’s choice does not tell you anything about her mind, personality or her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nnpatwari@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Calls to action have few benefits if they go unanswered, which is why the recent trend #metoo, a hashtag meant to express solidarity in the face of sexual assault and harassment, will not fulfill its potential unless it leads to social and political change.By themselves, the stories shared and simple acknowledgements made by #metoo participants do provide an important illustration of the magnitude of sexual violence committed. The hashtag reached 85 countries and was used in over 1.7 million tweets in just 10 days. These stories also make statistical representations of this matter more personal. Social media users who see testimonies of friends and family are forced to realize people they love have been affected by a political issue. The Editorial Board applauds the courage of survivors who spoke out and recognizes the equal courage of those who chose not to share.But we feel it would be a disservice to the millions of Americans who have experienced sexual violence if nothing more is done. Before we go any further, it is important to acknowledge that the use of the phrase “me too” as a method to share experiences of sexual violence and show solidarity with survivors did not start with Alyssa Milano, whose Oct. 15 tweet is considered to have initiated the #metoo trend. The idea began 20 years ago, well before Twitter, with Tarana Burke, black founder of a nonprofit organization called Just Be Inc. that provides survivors of sexual violence with resources and assistance. Given that feminism has a history of problems with intersectionality, the Editorial Board feels it is only right to give Ms. Burke her due credit. Now that #metoo has gained national attention, it is imperative that we use this momentum to enact change. One impediment to progress is the inappropriate politicization of sexual violence. The current debates between our major political parties suggest one’s treatment of sexual violence should accord in some way with one’s political ideologies. Truthfully, this issue demands urgent legislative attention and could be better addressed if law enforcement agencies processing the reported cases were better trained. Even if, like the majority of Americans, you are not an elected official or police officer, you still have a responsibility to serve your fellow citizens. The simple truth is that toxic masculinity is a public health issue, and we desperately need a paradigm shift in our collective idea of what it means to be a man. Encouraging men to engage in healthy emotional expression and letting go of our expectations of male invincibility are essential, as is eliminating the notion that men should be aggressive, physically powerful and assertive of their dominance over women and other men.We also need to be better allies when we recognize sexual violence or abuse. We need more Finn Wolfhard’s who are willing to take a stand, as opposed to individuals like Quentin Tarantino, whose complicit silence enables sexual predators to continue to violate their victims with impunity. Harvey Weinstein has racked up more than 50 accusations of sexual assault and harassment. Yet he now deflects due consequences under the guise of rehab for sex addiction and said his actions were the product of “the culture” in which he grew up. While these statements show egregious inability to accept personal responsibility, we do need a cultural change, and we would be remiss not to make that change now. ',\n",

       "  'body': 'In light of the recent allegations and subsequent damnations of Harvey Weinstein, Finn Wolfhard, a 14-year-old actor famous for his roles in \"Stranger Things\" and \"It,\" has fired his agent upon learning he had been accused of sexual assault.Naturally, Americans are proud of such a young actor for standing up for sexual assault victims. Wolfhard should be celebrated for standing up for other child actors who may feel they do not have a voice in the sexual assault discussion. However, we must remember to pay attention to the stories of survivors of sexual assault, rather than solely celebrating allies to the survivors.Wolfhard\\'s agent Tyler Grasham was terminated from the Agency for Performing Arts after a former child actor and another editor came out about the abuse they endured while working with him.Blaise Godbe Lipman, now 27, had just turned 18 when Grasham used alcohol to make him less likely to react to the assault during what was supposed to be a business meeting. Initially, he didn\\'t use Grasham’s name in his post about his suffering in the film and television industry, but decided to name drop once Grasham poked him on Facebook shortly after he made the post. In a recent Facebook post, Lipman explains the fear of coming out as a sexual assault victim as a child actor. He says that at that age, all actors are throwaways and can be replaced, a fact Grasham and other agents tell child actors frequently. This creates a heavily imbalanced power dynamic between actor and agent.Lipman also was subjected to mistreatment for being a young gay actor who had gay managers and agents. While it is amazing that Wolfhard already has the social consciousness at his age to step away from such hurtful men, it is Lipman’s post we should be sharing virally. Rather than just retweeting how brave Wolfhard is, we should amplify the voices of survivors. Lipman offers a different perspective on the sexual assault issue within the industry than those who are on the outside of Hollywood. He claims that many people were silent \"because we all want to get our movies green-lit, or to get hired for that next show, or for our clients to book that next the job.\"This isn’t acceptable grounds for assault. It isn’t even an excuse, but it is a reason. And the honesty about it can be refreshing.Out of all of the terror, sadness and anger that has come from the Weinstein blow up in the last month, we can at least take solace in that it is on everyone’s minds, and some people are doing things to make the system better.\\r\\n\\r\\nmmgarbac@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The polychromatic evidence of a color run was visible early Saturday afternoon all across campus. A key card reader stamped with vibrant powder, blue patches on the walls of a dormitory elevator where an exhausted runner had rested and streets dunked in yellow, red, blue and green powder were all telltale signs of the Jill Behrman Color the Campus 5K Run/Walk. That morning, 1,300 people arrived at the Student Recreational Sports Center for the 5K. The 18th annual run memorialized the disappearance and death of Jill Behrman, a student who disappeared from campus after a solo bike ride in May 2000. In October of 2000, the run was created to keep the memory of Jill alive and raise awareness for campus safety.Marilyn Behrman, Jill’s mother and a staff member in the Media School, said the first thing that comes to mind when she thinks of Jill is her smile. She said that growing up, Jill played sports with the boys. She played a multitude of sports including soccer, basketball, softball and volleyball.“She was very much into fitness and just healthy lifestyle,” Behrman said.Behrman also said that Jill had a passion for bike riding. In the summer between high school and her freshman year at IU, Jill biked from Bloomington to Atlantic City, New Jersey with deCycles Indiana, a youth leadership program that organizes cross-country bike rides for students aged 13-24.Behrman said she thinks campus safety has improved since Jill’s disappearance. She points to personal safety workshops, which are benefited by proceeds of the 5K, the Culture of Care project and the Indiana Lifeline Law as signs that IU is doing more to ensure the safety of students on campus.While student awareness may have improved through these efforts, the numbers are less optimistic. According to the Uniform Crime Report compiled by the FBI, 10 violent crimes were reported on Bloomington’s campus in 2000. The number of violent crimes occurring each year varies wildly between zero violent crimes in 2009 and the high of 38 violent crimes in 2015.Violent crimes include murders, rapes, robberies and assaults. From 2000 to 2005, an average of 17.6 violent crimes occurred on campus each year.From 2006 to 2011, an average of 10 violent crimes occurred on campus each year.From 2013 to 2016, an average of 22.75 violent crimes occurred on campus each year. No data was reported for 2012.Overall, between 2000 and 2016, an average of 16 violent crimes occurred on campus each year.The FBI cautions against comparing crime rates between universities of similar sizes because of the numerous different variables at play at local law enforcement between universities. Chris Geary, service director for evaluation, special projects and special events at IU Recreational Sports and event organizer for the Jill Behrman 5K, says she feels it’s hard to know if campus safety has improved.Geary said that in part, it’s hard to tell if the situation has improved because we’re talking about campus safety much more than we did 18 years ago. She points to addresses by former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden on campus sexual assault as signs that awareness for issues of violence on college campuses has improved.“You have these high-level public officials saying, \\'We can\\'t have this keep going on,\\' Geary said. “It\\'s really hard to say, but I don\\'t feel like it\\'s gotten better. I\\'m always hopeful.\"',\n",

       "  'body': 'Bloomington was the only city in Indiana to receive a perfect score of 100 in the Human Rights Campaign 2017 Report. This report, which specifically determines how municipalities treat LGBT people, was judged mostly by criteria such as insurance policies for transgender health care needs, non-discrimination policies regarding sexual orientation and gender identity and public support of the LGBT community by the city’s leaders. While these achievements are important and should be celebrated, Bloomington is not a utopia when it comes to human rights — it should not be treated as such. There is still much work to do in ensuring the community is dedicated to protecting the human rights of all people.First and foremost, the Human Rights Campaign is a respectable organization whose work should not be discredited or ignored. LGBT issues, however, are just one aspect of human rights.Additionally, Bloomington’s perfect score implies there is no room to improve in LGBT rights, which isn’t true. Cities can always do more to foster an inclusive environment, and the Editorial Board worries that a perfect score could lead to the city resting on its laurels. Quantitatively measuring human rights and labeling a city as perfect implies a sort of utopia, and Bloomington is simply not one.There are many other areas of human rights where Bloomington is severely lacking.For example, Bloomington has had many instances of unfair treatment toward its homeless population. This past summer, police presence increased at People’s Park on Kirkwood in response to the high number of homeless people that gathered there. This drove them away to various locations and did nothing to solve the underlying problem. Even though there are multiple homeless shelters in Bloomington, there is simply not enough space for all of them.With increased police presence in areas where homeless people gather, it gives the impression it is illegal to be homeless here. Police insist this increased presence is to curb addiction and criminal activity instead of homelessness, but the issues all go hand-in-hand. It does not make sense that a city with a perfect human rights score would treat its own homeless people this way.Many other issues of human rights continue to manifest in Bloomington. There are seemingly constant cases of drug abuse and alleged sexual assault. Until these problems are fixed, citizens should not label Bloomington as a paragon of human rights — especially using only one study that analyzes just one aspect of human rights as a whole. It is important to note the city’s important achievements regarding policy toward the LGBT community, but labelling Bloomington as having a perfect score for human rights is both misleading and disingenuous. Until the city solves problems like homelessness and drug abuse, Bloomington should not celebrate its own so-called perfection.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have erupted with “#MeToo” posts in the last few days. As of 6:30 p.m. Oct. 17, Facebook had seen more than 12 million posts, comments and reactions in less than 24 hours by 4.7 million users around the world. Twitter, in the same 24 hours, saw half a million tweets. Social media users saw these posts from friends, parents, sorority sisters, classmates, coworkers and more. Facebook reported that over 45 percent of Facebook users had a friend who posted that hashtag. The volume of these posts in such a short amount of time should be startling, as fellow hashtags to unite women such as #YesAllWomen were tweeted only 1.2 million times over four days. This may leave social media or the concerned citizen wondering why this hashtag, out of all hashtags, is going viral. Friends and family are choosing to go public with this trend but not others.It’s because this hashtag’s primary purpose is not to push a political agenda or spark mass outrage, its primary purpose is focused on solidarity and opening eyes.This hashtag allows victims of sexual assault to recognize they are not alone. It also allows people around the world to realize how startling the frequency of sexual assault is. #MeToo is even different from other solidarity-related hashtags, such as #PrayForOrlando and #LoveIsLove. #MeToo serves as a platform for victims of sexual assault to speak out about their personal experiences, possibly for the first time. This hashtag isn’t meant for every single person to unite behind one concept, but it is for people to speak out together and make others internalize the magnitude of this devastating issue.For possibly the first time ever, a hashtag is being used to make people sit back and think, not actively contribute. The hashtag concept doesn’t ask posters to call for political action or place blame on certain systems. It is simply about showing the pervasiveness of a depravity that could hit closer to home than once thought. The question surrounding #MeToo then becomes: Will this spark more activism efforts or political action? The end-game of this online movement is unclear.Viral hashtags have not always led to mobilization offline. Think #FreeKodak or #Election2016. Posting about an issue does not necessarily translate to releasing a rapper from jail or getting to the polls on Election Day. This hashtag’s long-term intent is ambiguous. The hope could be that more people will vote on sexual assault legislation. It could be that sexual offenders will begin to receive harsher sentences or be treated as more serious criminals.It is unclear what will come out of the circulation of #MeToo, but there is one intention of this hashtag that is crystal clear. #MeToo forces social media users everywhere to realize that sexual assault is no small issue. It is real and could be affecting those closest to you. ccarigan@indiana.edu\\r\\n@carmesanchicken',\n",

       "  'body': \"EDITORS' NOTE: This column originally incorrectly stated a member of Phi Delta Theta was arrested earlier this year for the rape of a student at a party. IU police investigated an alleged rape at the fraternity, but no one was arrested. The IDS attempts to be as fair and balanced in its reporting as possible – even in opinion columns. We apologize for this mistake. For a feeranging from a couple hundred dollars to a couple thousand dollars per semester, students can proudly wear the letters of a greek house. The cost to campus as a whole, however, is far greater than this. Under the guise of brotherhood and sisterhood, college greek life is a classist system that puts both members and nongreek students at risk. Indiana University should abolish it.One of the biggest risks associated with greek life is the alleged hazing that comes along with recruitment.In a poll conducted by StopHazing, a hazing research and prevention organization, 73 percent of students involved in fraternities or sororities have experienced at least one hazing behavior. Hazing, as defined by Webster Dictionary, is an initiation process involving harassment. In college, hazing is better reflected as a slew of ridiculous tasks and heavy drinking meant to indoctrinate a recruit into his or her greek house. While sometimes harmless fun, the majority of hazing involves dangerous activities that put people at risk. The list of accidents and deaths due to alleged hazing incidents is staggering. It seems at least once a year, a college is under fire for someone dying during the initiation process of rushing. This past year, Penn State sophomore Tim Piazza was killed after being forced to drink excessively. He fell down a set of stairs, and when one brother tried to call for help, he was stopped. Piazza bled internally for 12 hours before emergency services were contacted.If rushing greek life is obviously dangerous and allegedly encourages predatory behavior, we need to abolish it, instead of giving it seemingly infinite second chances. Two years ago, the IU chapter of Alpha Tau Omega was shut down because a viral video depicted an activity in which new pledges were allegedly forced to perform sexual acts in front of their brothers and other pledges. Only months ago, another fraternity was also suspended for related activity. The IU chapter of Delta Tau Delta was shut down by its governing body this past January for “hazing-related incidents.” This was after a member of the fraternity was prosecuted for allegedly sexually assaulting someone at a party. Kicking a few fraternities off campus has done little to solve the larger cultural problems in greek life.  Sororities are not exempt from this problem either. This spring, the IU chapter of Delta Delta Delta had its charter revoked for “probationary violations and hazing.”Hazing aside, sororities and fraternities across hundreds of college campuses have been involved in alleged cases of sexual assault, battery and rape. These instances of dangerous and reckless behavior affect everyone on campus, regardless of whether or not someone is a member of a greek house – so just eradicate the problem. Greek life is not a way to make friends. It is not a philanthropic organization.These expressions are excuses to cover up why people want to wear the letters – it establishes class. Those who have the monetary capability to join a house can view themselves as a member of the upper echelon of a financial hierarchy.If you need information about where to volunteer for real philanthropy, Bloomington is overflowing with it. If you are concerned about making friends, IU offers endless clubs for various interests and goals. Greek life has never been about building a supportive community, and it never will be. It is about partying and reckless behavior – typically to the detriment of nongreek students and members alike. When cancer is killing the body, we remove it. Greek life should be treated the same. anneande@indiana.edu\",\n",

       "  'body': 'To colleagues, family and friends, Guoping Wang is a dedicated family man, hard worker and accomplished ballet dancer and instructor.He is helpful, humble and soft spoken, the type of father who cooked breakfast for his family every morning and would run to and from his work duties to ensure his kids got to piano lessons or math club on time.This is how he is described in seven character letters submitted to the court last week. The former Jacobs School of Music lecturer, who, through his lawyer, declined to be interviewed for this article, was sentenced to two years of probation Wednesday after a student reported in spring 2016 that he had sexually assaulted her.As the Indiana Daily Student previously reported, this allegation was one of multiple against Wang that the University found while investigating. The details of these allegations are contained in a 13-page memorandum which has not been made available to the public. The complainant in this particular case requested police involvement, according to court documents.Those who have worked with Wang said they never thought he was capable of such a thing. When he was arrested last spring, he was charged with criminal confinement and sexual battery. At the Wednesday hearing, he pleaded guilty to the criminal confinement charge with the battery charge being dropped.“These charges are so far out of character I simply cannot believe it to be true,” wrote Sara Knight, a character witness who met Wang at a ballet camp in Cincinnati. “I have never witnessed him to be inappropriate. Ever.”Wang grew up in China and had a poor upbringing. In court documents, his wife said they met as students at the Shanghai Dance Academy before marrying and moving to America.The brochure for the 2016 Spring Ballet says he worked with the Shanghai Ballet Company for 11 years before coming to IU, where he attended the Jacobs School of Music for graduate studies. After graduation, he worked with multiple prestigious ballet companies, including the Ballet Chicago Company, Colorado Ballet, Joffrey Ballet of Chicago and Lyric Opera of Chicago.According to several of the character letters, he chose to teach dance at IU and in several other programs after retiring from professional performance.At one point, Wang’s family lived outside Chicago while he worked in Bloomington and drove back and forth between the two cities every weekend. Three people who knew him during his time in Chicago mentioned this in their letters, saying it was both a testament to his passion for ballet and his devotion to his family.Ballet instructors in New York, Ohio and Maine said they had observed him teach students without incident, and some said they invited him to teach their own. They added that he was a soft spoken person who may have had trouble sometimes communicating in English but got his point across nonetheless. When Judge Marc Kellams asked Wang about his English skills Wednesday, he described them as \"not so good.\"“Most ballets use French,” Wang said.All of Wang\\'s former colleagues said he got stellar reviews from students. Jacques Cesbron, who has been a ballet instructor at IU, said he was impressed by Wang’s teaching style and his ability to combine his American and Chinese training.Other colleagues say he offered to substitute other instructors’ classes. He took on side jobs at other ballet schools to share his expertise and help support his family.He taught ballet at IU for over a decade before the University fired him after investigating multiple reports of unwanted advances toward students and staff, according to court documents.Wang, who has worked with ballet companies on at least four continents, testified under oath Wednesday that he had taken a job working at Menards. His wife, who said she had been a homemaker for 20 years, has also taken a job to support the family.The testaments to Wang’s character became a key part of Wednesday’s hearing. Kellams said he read the letters, which spoke of a loving father and accomplished ballet master.“Mr. Wang is more than this bad act,” Wang’s lawyer Katherine Liell said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Fingerprint technology is changing exponentially. Soon, we will be able to determine drug usage, condom usage, gender and even specific brands of hair gel from a single set of fingerprints from a suspect. Sheffield Hallam University and the West Yorkshire Police Department in the United Kingdom have been working together to finalize the technology that will change high-stakes crime cases. This development is incredibly technologically progressive and will be a huge help to the criminal justice system. In recent years, forensic departments and courtrooms alike have been more wary about placing absolute certainty in fingerprint technology. The issues lie in the possibility of nabbing two partial fingerprints that are identical, indicating a \"match,\" while the whole print may be unique. Technology that could better assess fingerprints doesn\\'t exist, but this new U.K. development may be able to do so. Mass spectrometry is the method forensic scientists use to break down fingerprints to find the chemical makeup that makes them unique. Dr. Simona Francese is leading the research project to finalize the technology and put it into effect. She broke down the process to better explain how forensics can find these identifying traits. \"When you think about what a fingerprint is, it\\'s nothing else but sweat, and sweat is a biological matrix,\" she said. \"It contains molecules from within your body but also molecules that you have just contaminated your fingertips with, so the amount of information there potentially to retrieve is huge.\"This chemical-detecting technology would still require a full print to get the whole story behind a fingerprint, but for those officers who can find a full print, they would have more evidence to find perpetrators for crimes such as rape, murder and burglary.Even though fingerprinting technology won’t be perfect, this is still an amazing development because it will help provide proof that may otherwise be missing in cases.For example, in rape cases, it’s hard to prosecute a rape kit if the rapist wore a condom. However, if there are fingerprints left anywhere at the crime scene, forensic scientists would be able to use this new technology to determine whether the rapist wore a condom. Rapists have begun wearing condoms to avoid getting STDs, impregnating their victims and leaving behind DNA in their semen.The fingerprint can help in cases in which the rapist is already in the system or the victim knew who raped them and more proof was needed to convict him.Also, the fingerprints can prove alcohol and drug usage. If a victim believes he or she was drugged, the U.K. technology could determine, using the set of fingerprints, whether or the alleged rapist touched a date rape drug.This new practice can, hopefully, make a difference in the process of prosecuting high class crimes.If this can help a few victims find peace of mind, then it is more than worth the effort that has gone into researching and testing the technology.mmgarbac@indiana.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'A former Jacobs School of Music lecturer accused of sexually assaulting a student was sentenced Wednesday morning to two years probation.Guoping Wang, 55, pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal confinement. A second charge of sexual battery was dropped as a part of a plea deal.“Mr. Wang is more than this bad act,” Wang’s attorney, Katharine Liell, told the judge, drawing attention to his character as a dedicated husband and father to two daughters. “Wang is more than his worst act.”Wang, a former dance coach, was arrested in July 2016 and spent 28 hours in jail after one of his ballet students accused him of sexually assaulting her in his IU office during a fall 2015 ballet rehearsal. The student said Wang trapped her in his office after offering to help her with stretches and technique. He then removed her leotard and tights, according to court documents, and proceeded to sexually assault her on the floor of the office.IU’s own investigation of Wang in March 2016 unearthed multiple reports that Wang made unwanted advances toward staff and students. Six others said Wang forcibly kissed them on the mouth.Speaking Wednesday through interpreters, Judge Marc Kellams reviewed the terms of the plea deal with Wang, whose first language is Mandarin. Wang would serve none of his two year sentence in jail if he admitted to committing criminal confinement — or, in this case, if he admitted to preventing the student from leaving his office that day after the November rehearsal.Standing stoically before the judge, Wang said very little during the hearing except to answer Kellams’ question on the charge of criminal confinement: “Do you plead guilty or not guilty?”Wang paused, waited for translation and with his right hand raised quietly replied with one word in English.“Guilty.”Kellams accepted the plea deal, on the conditions that Wang meets the standard terms of probation, such as meeting regularly with a probation officer, avoiding future arrests and avoiding drug use. A deputy prosecutor speaking on behalf Wang’s former student said she was supportive of the plea agreement.After the hearing, Liell told the Indiana Daily Student that because the sexual battery charge was dropped, Wang will not be required to register for as a sexual offender. She said Wang is seeking one-on-one counseling with a therapist.As a former senior lecturer in the Jacobs ballet department, Wang worked extensively with students. A major part of his job was preparing them for the ballet department’s annual performance of “The Nutcracker.”It was rehearsing for this event in November 2015 where Wang’s former ballet student said the instructor forced himself on her.“Please, Guoping, no,” the student said as the two struggled on the office floor, according to court documents. “This can’t happen.”That night the ballet student told her roommate what happened. She also later talked to her dance partner, when he approached her with a present Wang asked him to deliver for the ballet student’s birthday.The student didn’t report the incident to IU until the following March, just after IU’s spring ballet. The University assigned its own investigator to the case, but didn’t contact police until the ballet student requested their involvement at some point during IU’s investigation.The University fired Wang on May 9, 2016, after the school’s investigation turned up multiple complaints of unwanted advances made toward students and staff. IU’s investigation of these complaints has been kept secret in a 13-page memorandum the University has refused to discuss openly. The contents of this memorandum could address questions about the extent of accusations levied against Wang, how IU handled these complaints and why the University waited six weeks to notify police of the ballet student’s report of sexual assault. The memo could also play into a greater culture of secrecy that IU maintains when it comes to issues of sexual assault.When Wang was fired, the University released a statement in which the provost and the dean of Jacobs condemned sexual assault on campus.“This occurrence runs counter to our values,” Jacobs Dean Gwyn Richards said in the May 2016 statement. “We will continue to do everything we can to make sure that our students have the ideal environment in which to pursue their artistic and academic goals.”Yet, several former members of Jacobs faculty defended Wang’s teaching styles in character statements submitted to the court last week. They said Wang excelled as a teacher, he was respectful and polite and was loved by students.“I had worked with Guoping in the same department for a long time,” said Chun Chi An, a former ballet music director at Jacobs. “I had never seen any inappropriate or disrespectful behaviors he exhibited toward any female students and faculty members.”The character statements also included testimony from family, friends and former colleagues.“I have students ages 16 to 21,” said Sara Knight, who met Wang at a summer ballet program in Cincinnati. “I would trust Mr. Guoping Wang 100 percent with my own students.”Appearing before the court Wednesday, Wang’s attorney made a case that this was the former instructor’s first offense, and that because he is no longer working with students, such behavior is unlikely to happen again.When Kellams’ accepted the plea deal, he said he believed prosecutors and Wang’s attorneys worked “long and hard” to come to the two-year probation agreement. He noted the losses, including employment and fees for legal and translation services, Wang had encountered in the nearly two years since the alleged sexual assault occurred.“He has suffered substantial consequences as a result of this behavior,” Kellams said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Cornell Iral Haynes Jr., better known as the rapper Nelly, was arrested early Saturday morning by police in Auburn, Washington, following a report of second-degree rape. His lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, later released a statement saying that Nelly had not been charged and had been released from custody. The Editorial Board is unconvinced by attempts on the part of Nelly and Rosenblum to control the narrative of the case by claiming that the “initial investigation clearly establishes this allegation is devoid of credibility.” This statement is just as, if not more, likely to be protective flexing as it is to be based in fact, given what little information has been made available to the public in the Auburn Police Department press release. Nelly is not, as he once sang in “Country Grammar” during his rise to fame, “righteous above the law.” The Editorial Board firmly believes that the only special point of consideration made relevant by the rapper’s celebrity status is a boycott of his work.The alleged rape is said to have occurred on a tour bus associated with an ongoing tour by country band Florida Georgia Line – a tour from which the Editorial Board believes Nelly should be removed until a decision is reached concerning his case.  Further actions, such as boycotts on performances or recordings of his music, ought to be taken against him until his name is cleared. And, they should continue if he is found guilty. Even if Nelly’s music is a staple in your life, we are sure you can find other rappers to replace him.It may seem that, in saying this, we are treating Nelly as though he is guilty until proven innocent. We fully recognize that Nelly has yet to be charged with anything and that the investigation has only just begun. However, we unequivocally believe that boycotts are the appropriate method by which to show that we take the victim’s allegations, as well as the ensuing investigation, seriously.If Nelly is correct in claiming his innocence against false accusations, a scenario which has at best an 8 percent likelihood according to data from a study evaluated by the National Center for the Prosecution of Violence Against Women, then the defamation suit he has promised to pursue will restore to him whatever he may have lost during preconviction boycotts. It may, in fact, leave him better off financially than he was before.If, however, he is found to be guilty, the boycotts should become permanent. We have made our stance on artists who commit violent acts against women perfectly clear, and we feel that Nelly presents an opportunity to put those beliefs in practice. It is of course still important to separate ourselves from the likes of Chris Brown, Kodak Black, XXXtentacion and others of their ilk, but we hope responses to Nelly’s case will break what has become a disappointingly apathetic cycle. This case is a chance for the public to do the right thing from the beginning and give due respect to the serious and widespread issue of sexual violence. ',\n",

       "  'body': \"The conversation of how to best handle campus reports of sexual assault continued Tuesday in a Bloomington Faculty Council discussion of sexual misconduct complaints levied against IU faculty.BFC was slated to share opinions on the Bloomington campus’ specific Faculty Board of Review policy, but the discussion quickly broadened to include a debate of faculty rights and fairness presented in University investigations.BFC President Alex Tanford introduced the topic as the BFC representative for a five-person task force currently reviewing University sexual misconduct policy as it relates to faculty members.Tanford began with a brief presentation on how IU responds to reports of sexual assault against University faculty. In such cases, an IU investigator compiles a report based on collected evidence and witness interviews to be presented to a separate campus administrator who uses the investigator’s findings to decide whether IU policy was violated and what faculty sanctions should be placed.If either side is unhappy with the administrator’s decision, it can request a Faculty Board of Review, which allows five faculty members elected by the BFC to review the case and either agree with the original finding or suggest new recommendations to the provost for consideration.However, this faculty review policy was written years before IU’s current Sexual Misconduct Policy was enacted in 2012, and it applies to a number of different types of faculty complaints, most frequently including questions of tenure, Provost Lauren Robel noted at Tuesday's meeting. Robel said only one faculty case has been heard at IU under current policy.So, the five-member task force is now looking to reconsider how the Faculty Board of Review policy should factor in to IU’s sexual assault procedures in the event any future reports against faculty are made.Major concerns about the Faculty Board of Review process include what role reporting students and faculty should play in the board review process, what time frames should be used to make review board decisions and whether the Faculty Board of Review should conduct its own review of sexual misconduct reports.Currently, the Faculty Board of Review doesn't allow witnesses, such as those who have reported against a faculty member, to attend its hearings. Those who are in favor of an expedited review process say it will bring quicker resolution to both parties involved in sexual misconduct reports. Also, the review board currently only makes decisions based on the findings of the University investigator.While the council recognized these issues in respect to Tanford’s focus on the Faculty Board of Review, BFC members quickly drew the conversation into a larger discussion of the University’s broader Sexual Misconduct Policy.Several members noted recent changes in federal guidance for how schools should respond to reports of sexual assault. Others raised concerns of how IU policy can strike a balance between providing a supportive environment for those seeking to report sexual assault with providing fairness to faculty who are accused in the IU system.BFC members quickly drew debate of what parties’ rights should be in these cases. IU’s policy does not allow either a person reporting or accused of sexual assault to have an adviser or attorney speak on his or her behalf. Neither party can cross examine witnesses in the Faculty Board of Review, and decisions are made on a lower standard of proof called preponderance of evidence.“Historically, due process and the rights of the accused have been very important in this country,” BFC member Kenneth Dau-Schmidt said. “And these tenured professors, or these professors with a property interest in their job at a public university, certainly do have due process rights, and it’s very important, no matter what they’re accused of, that’s those rights not be traught on.”Robel was quick to draw the distinction between rights offered in the criminal justice system versus the University system, such as standards of proof and attorney participation. She said the rights offered in the Faculty Board of Review procedure – regardless of whether the case is related to a complaint of sexual assault – are what the University considers faculty members’ given due process rights.“A criminal case is a very different thing,” Robel said. “I know it feels pretty high, and it is to lose his or her job, but it’s not the same thing as losing the possibilities of one’s liberties.”Others on the council rejected the notion that IU’s procedures need to incorporate more rights and fairness to faculty accused of sexual assault. BFC member Rebecca Spang said she recognizes that very few cases of sexual misconduct are reported against faculty members and fewer make it to a formal hearing.She said she is more inclined to favor a policy that is weighted more heavily in favor of the person who reports sexual assault and that this person shouldn’t be made to retell his or her account to a Faculty Board or Review after an IU administrator had decided the case.“I don’t want anybody who has gone through the process of claiming, rightly or wrongly, that he or she was sexually assaulted by a faculty member to then have to sit through another meeting where someone says ‘You’re making this up,’” Spang said.The council reached no consensus in its nearly 20-minute discussion. However, the council never intended to vote on the issue. Tanford said he brought the topic to BFC to gather the the council's input to share at his next task force meeting.“At some point, when things are balanced on that knife edge, a policy is either going to have to favor a victim or favor the accused,” Tanford told the council. “And that’s the place where it’s most difficult.”\",\n",

       "  'body': 'The Bloomington Faculty Council discussed three major topics in its meeting on Oct. 3, including non-tenure track faculty issues, the results of the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education faculty satisfaction survey and revisions to the sexual misconduct policy.Non-Tenure Track Faculty IssuesNick Williams and Jonathan Trinidad, co-chairs of the non-tenure track task force, focused on the issue of non-tenure track faculty participation on the Bloomington Faculty Council. Of its 68 members, only three are non-tenure track members.“The most important thing we can gather is the feeling of this group,” Williams said.The non-tenure track falls into three different categories: lecturers, clinical appointments and research appointments. The task force was trying to achieve a proportional representation of non-tenure track faculty on the council in comparison with the percentage of the faculty population they make up. Currently, the council looks at proportionality of units instead.Members of the council disagreed on the best way to integrate more non-tenure track faculty into the Bloomington Faculty Council. From talking to their colleagues, faculty members said the non-tenured track faculty was for proportional representation but the tenured track was not. One member said shared governance needed the protection of tenure. Another said the non-tenure track faculty was being treated as second-class citizens.The Bloomington Faculty Council ran out of time discussing this issue.COACHE Survey PresentationEliza Pavalko, vice provost for faculty and academic affairs, presented the results for the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education survey, a survey about faculty satisfaction in different areas of the University. The results allowed for internal comparisons as well as comparisons to other universities.Overall findings were that satisfaction was strong in areas such as benefits, policies and practices.“Our goal is to make IU a supportive place for everybody,” Pavalko said.The areas that showed a need for improvement were campus climate for underrepresented faculty, environment for associate professors and conditions for non-tenured track faculty.Pavalko said underrepresented faculty did not show much of a difference in their feelings of support in work environments but rather in the cultural experience. She said John Nieto-Phillips, associate vice provost for faculty development and diversity is meeting with groups of faculty to work on this issue.Associate professors are the least satisfied, Pavalko said. Because of this, she said a focus will be placed on improving mentoring and working with different organizations to figure out the gaps for this group.Pavalko said there was a difference between how much interaction the non-tenure track faculty received and how much interaction tenured-track faculty and received. She said the issue will be looked into further.Sexual MisconductAlex Tanford, faculty president, looked at a faculty board of review in the sexual misconduct policy.  A five-member task force is now looking to reconsider how the Faculty Board of Review policy should factor in to IU’s sexual assault procedures in the event any future reports are made against faculty.

       "  'body': \"Public opinion of Hugh Hefner has been polarized throughout his entire life, and it has escalated since the 91-year-old creator and editor-in-chief of Playboy magazine died last week. It is unclear how society should remember him. To some, he is a progressive philanthropist, an intellectual and a “feminist before there was such a thing as feminism.”For others, he's an exploitative hedonist who pandered his subtle brand of sexism under the guise of social freedom.  Let’s look at the facts. Alex Haley published interviews with Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. under Hefner’s masthead, and authors ranging from Ursula K. Le Guin and Margaret Atwood to Ray Bradbury and Roald Dahl found homes for their writing amidst the scantily clad playmates of the magazine. The Playboy Foundation has created educational endowments and helped fund the development of the first rape kit. Hefner strongly supported First Amendment rights, same-sex marriage and women’s access to contraception and abortion. However, Playboy has also inexcusably published photos of women without their consent and has featured nude photos of underage actresses, including those of 11-year-old Eva Ionesco. Labeling Hefner as a liberator of femininity and human sexuality is demonstrative of utilitarianism’s failures as an ethical system. Intent, not consequence, must be used to determine the morality of Hefner’s actions, and Sophie Gilbert of the Atlantic has figured out Hefner’s position very well: “highly profitable conformism disguised as sexual freedom.”“For many feminists, the problem with the midcentury sexual revolution wasn’t the no-strings-attached sex; it was that they were 'free' to have sex on men’s terms — and, in the absence of social, economic and political power, this wasn’t exactly liberation,” Irin Carmon wrote for the Washington Post. Sex isn’t inherently a bad thing, but Hefner was wrong to think that could limit the definitions of sexuality, pleasure or beauty when they can exist in so many different forms. To quote writer and activist Susan Sontag, “Rules of taste enforce structures of power.”Hefner, who once specifically requested a ”devastating piece that takes the militant feminists apart,” supported free speech so he could continue peddling exploitative pornography without fear of censorship. He was pro-choice to ensure his harem could continue to operate with the same orgiastic fervor as his dehumanizing bunny mascot, now unburdened by any actual reproduction. He would pay for his girlfriends’ plastic surgery, but afraid of the independence a vehicle might provide, he refused to buy them cars. His true opinion of women was made clear in a 2010 interview with John Heilpern for Vanity Fair. “Feminists still oppose you for treating women as objects,” Heilpern cautioned. Hefner responded: “They are objects!” The objectification of women in general has cultivated a society in which someone is sexually assaulted every 98 seconds. It is a society in which female anatomy has been deemed more important than the female mind. The first step to true sexual revolution must be to eliminate this societal pedagogy of fear by creating an environment that is equally safe for men and women. Hefner may not have been complicit in violent actions, but he helped create the society in which they go unpunished and glorified. Centerfolds of decontextualized women with flawless bodies teach men to view the women in their lives as merely that: centerfolds and reams of high-gloss paper. Rhetoric is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used morally or immorally. Hefner’s rhetoric was designed to liberate so long as he could still objectify and empower, and so long as promiscuity and lust were not stripped away.If his purported feminism primarily benefited men and hegemonic masculinity, it was, in fact, feminism’s opposite. jhoffer@indiana.edu@jhoffer17\",\n",

       "  'body': \"The IU Police Academy's new director Major Nick Luce will have added responsibilities going forward.Individual IU campuses previously handled their own investigations into complaints and potential wrongdoings, Tracy James, communications manager for IU Public Safety and Institutional Assurance, said. Now, Luce is responsible for spearheading these investigations himself.“They’re taking a new focused approach to the job,” she said.Luce said the IU Police Department gave him this responsibility to take the burden of investigating from divisions busy with their own day-to-day work.He also said investigations work best when fewer people are involved and will be more impartial when led by someone not attached to the division.“If these are the men and women you work with, it becomes more personal,” he said. “We want to make sure the investigations stay objective and not too personal.”James said this new responsibility is part of why the IUPD decided to change the rank of the IU Police Academy director from captain to major, one rank above captain.Luce said the previous director, Captain Greg Butler, spent 22 years as director creating his legacy and improving the IU Police Academy by expanding diversity, firearms and sexual assault training. James said it is his time to step up and build on Butler’s legacy.One of these improvements is sending academy instructors back and forth between IU campuses to share resources.“We have so many great instructors, so why not share them and have them teach a bit in other campuses, as well?” James said.Luce said the instructors are also excited to offer their skills to different areas and to meet instructors from other campuses.Luce said he also plans to reach out to IU faculty members about teaching cadets or coming in to talk about their specific areas of expertise.He said he wants to work with the education and psychology departments to come up with a new crisis intervention and interpersonal communication system. The Kelley School of Business would also be a good resource for offering leadership training to cadets, he said.“Cops go to cop training, but we have a unique opportunity to go further than that,” Luce said. “Why not take advantage of all the knowledge we have at our fingertips?”\",\n",

       "  'body': \"In the waning Thursday evening light, demonstrators in front of the Monroe County Courthouse formed a tight circle. Candles illuminated the faces of sexual assault survivors telling their stories and the faces of allies who came to support them. For some, this was the first time they had ever shared their deeply personal stories of abuse, rape or sexual assault with anyone else.From 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., the Feminist Student Association participated in their annual Take Back the Night demonstration to talk about sexual assault and abuse. Just before 8 p.m., the group began to form a long line on Indiana Avenue, led by two women holding a sign that read “Take Back the Night” in blue lettering on a white poster. Behind them were 77 demonstrators, two of which were dogs.The group marched down Kirkwood Avenue to the courthouse to hold a “speak-out” so survivors of sexual assault could share their stories in a confidential setting.“It's not really as much of a protest as it is a standing in solidarity, it's more of a healing process,” Lauren Rothstein, president of the Feminist Student Association said.Rothstein said that the timing of the event worked well with some issues happening on campus right now such as the outrage regarding the fake It’s On Us sexual assault posters.“It's a way for people who were triggered or really upset by those to kind of have an outlet to share their experience and story with people who are really supportive,” Rothstein said.  As the event got underway, two speeches were given on the topic of sexual assault.Evelyn Smith, a community outreach coordinator from Middleway House, said that we lived in dangerous times. She touched on expanding immigration control, increased focus on law and order policing, the expanding industrial prison complex, and new sexual assault policy from Betsy DeVos. Smith said that it is important to show solidarity for people directly affected by these phenomena.“For those of us who are survivors, myself included, we know the pain of being asked, ‘Why didn’t you fight back?’” Smith said. “Well you know what, we are, and I only ask that we do it loudly for the sake of those who have been silenced and for those who can’t afford the risks and the visibility the struggle will bring.”The group marched down Kirkwood silently, a few of them hand in hand. One demonstrator wore a denim jacket that read “make Nazis afraid again” across the back. Two other wore matching “love shouldn’t hurt,” shirts, and another wore a jacket that said “Grl · PWR” under a “rock on” hand signal.At the courthouse, survivors of sexual assault were invited to share their stories. Someone would stand in the middle and speak for a short time. Some spoke through tears.At about 8:45 p.m., a man walked down the sidewalk on North Walnut Street.“Make America great again, baby!” he yelled.A SurvivorThe Feminist Student association asked media to not be at the speak-out at the courthouse in order to make survivors feel as comfortable sharing their stories as possible. Megan Chapman agreed to share her story with the IDS outside of the speak-out. Megan Chapman, a freshman from Carmel, Indiana, was sexually assaulted by her now ex-boyfriend when she was 17 years old. The assault occurred in his car after school. After it was over, Chapman had to work a shift at a restaurant in town.Chapman said that the they were making out in his car, and she told him she didn’t want to do anything sexual when the situation escalated. She said that he put her into a position where she couldn’t move and proceeded to finger her and make her perform oral sex on him without her consent.“During that shift, I already started to mentally compartmentalize what had happened and just sort of put it at the back of my mind so that I wouldn't have to think about it,” Chapman said. “And so, I never really did deal with it. I actually hadn't told that story to anyone until tonight.”Chapman said that after the assault occurred, her ex-boyfriend texted her asking what was wrong. She said she thought he suspected something was wrong after she acted coldly towards him after the assault. It wasn’t until hours later that they talked about what had happened.“He knew what he had done,” Chapman said. Chapman said she had a conversation with her ex-boyfriend after their text conversation about consent and their boundaries, but she didn’t realize until much later that what had happened was sexual assault. Chapman attributes this delay in understanding to the poor sexual assault education she received in high school. She said that her high school failed to teach her that sexual assault can just as easily be done by a significant other rather than a stranger or family member. She said that better sexual assault education since then helped her realize that the episode with her ex-boyfriend was sexual assault.Chapman said that she never moved forward with charges against her ex-boyfriend. She said because her ex-boyfriend has sought help since the assault, he has tried to better his actions.Chapman said that the reason she wanted to share her story was to let the people at the event know that just because they are in a committed sexual relationship with someone, that does not mean that person is entitled to the victim's body.“People need to remember that they do have protection over their own body and they can have boundaries on their body,” Chapman said. “Their significant other shouldn't be able to exploit that.”An earlier version of this story incorrectly named Megan Chapman upon first reference. The IDS regrets this error.\",\n",

Police were sent to Eigenmann Hall after a woman called to report she had been sexually assaulted.The woman, 19, told police she was assaulted by a man she knew at a party on the north side of town. She said the man grabbed her by the waist from behind. He then allegedly attempted to pull down her jean shorts. He allegedly announced he wanted to have sex with her and bit her neck. The girl told police she freed herself from the man’s grasp but fell down as she was trying to escape. The man then grabbed her by the hips again, she told police. A friend of the girl’s approached the pair and took her away. The case is under investigation. In the other incident, police responded to a report of rape on the north side of Bloomington.The woman, 20, told police she went a male friend’s home Friday night between 10 p.m. and midnight. She said she drank some juice that did not contain alcohol. She said she began to feel dizzy. The next thing she said she remembers was waking up naked at about 6 a.m. in the male friend’s bed. She said she then began to cry as she got dressed. Her male friend was there and tried talking to her. She told police she couldn’t remember whether or not she had sex that night. She was taken to the hospital. Police have not yet interviewed the male. This case is currently under investigation. Emerson Wolff',\n",

       "  'body': 'Flyers replicating IU’s sex and consent posters were found Sunday in IU-Bloomington bathroom stalls making false statements about the definitions of sexual assault and consent.The flyers were reportedly seen in the School of Public Health, the Fine Arts Building and the Indiana Memorial Union, and claimed sexual assault “occurs when attention whores need extra sympathy and decide to cry raep [sic].”The fake flyers closely resembled posters distributed on campus last year with similar categories on “What is consent?” “What is sexual assault?” “How do I get consent?” and “But what if?” However, each response to these questions was rewritten with answers like “consent is a generic buzzword that we use to shove our own personal brand of feminism down your throat,” and “if you disagree with us, you are a dead mother fucker.”Photos of the flyer began circulating on social media Monday morning as a screenshot of a Snapchat was tweeted by an IU-Bloomington student saying “This is NOT funny.”The flyers were marked with the familiar #ItsOnUsIU hashtag and a link to a website not affiliated with the University.IU released a statement on the posters Monday evening calling them “fake and offensive.\"The provocative flyers were posted intentionally, according to the statement, to attract students to visit the website listed at the bottom of the flyers, which could then install malware on electronic devices like laptops.“Sexual assault is not a laughing matter,” IU’s statement read. “Sexual assault is an endemic issue facing college students nationwide, and one that we are actively trying to eradicate from our campus and community.”Ryan Piurek, a University spokesperson, said IU first learned of the posters Monday afternoon and that University information technology officers reviewed the website and cut off students\\' access to the link from IU servers.Senior Lindsey Franxman went looking for the flyers before class after hearing about it through a group text with friends. She said she was outraged when she found one in a main floor bathroom at the Union. She couldn\\'t stop thinking about the culture of sexual assault at IU — the fact that some of her friends had been drugged at bars this year or the traction of an incentive tweet posted by the new nightclub Kilroy\\'s Recess. Franxman said she looked again in the Union after class to find the flyer had been ripped down.\"The fact that someone thought that was OK to post is mind-boggling,\" Franxman said. \"Maybe it was a joke, but it\\'s not funny. Sexual assault is a very serious thing that people go through everyday.\"Campus and community organizations were quick to condemn the posters. IU\\'s Culture of Care released a statement calling the posters \"insensitive and hurtful mockeries.\" Middle Way House expressed disappointment not only with the content of the posters, but with some students\\' jovial reactions.The executive board of Raising Awareness of Interactions in Sexual Encounters, or RAISE at IU, also released a statement to its members Monday afternoon. The student organization, which works to promote healthy sexual relationships, said the message of the posters \"grossly misrepresents the realities of false reports of sexual assaults.\"\"This blatant attack not only aims to harass all people who have been victims of sexual assault, but also encourages others to accept this disgusting behavior,\" the statement read. \"We will not tolerate it.\"Junior Toby Klein, a director of outreach and education at RAISE, said the message of the posters didn\\'t come as a surprise. She compared it to tension bubbling up at rallies like the one in Charlottesville, Virginia, and said the posters reflect misconceptions she has heard voiced about sexual assault survivors.\"These opinions have long been held by a lot of people,\" Klein said. \"This is absolutely appalling and disturbing, but it\\'s not a surprise.\"She said she hopes IU will do more following the spread of the flyers to take a stronger stance against campus rape and promote a sex positive culture.\"Words are not enough,\" Klein said. \"The University needs to do more to prevent rape culture.\"The IU Police Department is investigating the posters, according to IU\\'s statement, and students have been asked to contact IUPD at 812-855-4111 if they see the posters on campus.The IDS has reached out to IUPD for comment.

       "  'body': 'Although many Americans, including Derek Wolfe of the Denver Broncos and President Trump, continue to misunderstand the phenomenon, more NFL players than ever before are taking a knee during the national anthem as a form of protest against racial injustice. Taking a knee is now and always has been a peaceful protest. It has never intended to display the perceived disrespect toward military servicemen and women that is creating such controversy around the gesture. Players who choose to take a knee during the anthem have every right to do so. As every true American knows, the only way to form a more perfect union is to admit when something is wrong and have the courage to work toward a solution rather than ignoring or abandoning the situation. It all began in the early weeks of the NFL’s 2016 preseason games with Colin Kaepernick, who began his tenure as the league’s most controversial player when he took a stand against the oppression of black people in America by taking a knee during the national anthem.Kaepernick made his position clear during a public media conference. He said, \"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.\" He was also careful to clarify his support of the U.S. military by saying that “they fight for liberty and justice, for everyone.” He chose to sit, he said, because that equality of liberty and justice was “not happening.”This past year, taking a seat became taking a knee, and the NFL has become nearly as much an arena for politics as it is for sports.To those who rail against the politicization of an entertainment form traditionally used for escape: Stop. Celebrity status of the kind that NFL players acquire does not bar them from exercising their right to free speech. In fact, it does quite the opposite. We continually call upon people with public platforms to use their power for good, and that is exactly what the kneeling players are doing. It is shameful that Kaepernick is so demonized for his actions as to be barred from employment in the league, when so many other players who are  guilty of real crimes like domestic abuse, sexual assault and other offenses remain active. Think about the statement this makes. Free speech against our country’s lethally oppressive race issues is more incriminating than sexual and relationship violence. And before you hold up Ray Rice as a counterexample, spare me. One prominent player fired as a symbolic statement does not equate a comprehensive and adequate policy. As 2017 draft choices show, the league is still not taking a sufficient stand against such issues. I can hardly offer a clearer picture of ignorance than NFL owners, players and fans — supported by no less than the president of the United States — who continue to reinforce the very same damaging power structures that players like Kaepernick protest. Rather than punish those who choose to do the right thing, we should choose instead to do the right thing ourselves.We should show solidarity in any way we can with those whom racism oppresses and by working to effect positive change.mareklei@indiana.edu@foreverfloral97',\n",

       "  'body': \"A famous rapper is raking in the money and climbing the Billboard Top 100 despite charges  of aggravated assault against his girlfriend. Which rapper is this? The fact that we had to ask, and that multiple men could fit this description, is the issue. Despite public records of these men being convicted of aggravated assault, domestic violence and rape, rappers and other men in the entertainment business have lost nothing. Their songs and movies continue to collect royalties, and people are still listening to songs and watching movies created by people who have histories of violence against women. The Editorial Board thinks that we should be taking this a little more seriously. Dating back to Chris Brown’s 2009 arrest and conviction, violence against women has been present in the entertainment business. Recently, rapper Kodak Black was arrested with a rape charge. He was jailed because of a probation violation with no additional time for the rape. New XXL Freshman Class rapper XXXTentacion is currently on trial for gross battery and sexual assault against his pregnant girlfriend.This is public knowledge, so it's disheartening that people are still supporting the art of creators who can’t respect others.There is a fine line between “separating art from the artist,” and that line needs to be drawn at violence against others, especially against women. Listening to a Britney Spears song, even though she had a traffic accident, is much different than listening to and defending men who have beaten and raped women with little or no consequence. When you defend listening to Kodak Black’s “Tunnel Vision,” Chris Brown’s “Party,” or XXXTentacion’s “Revenge,” you implicitly deny that they have committed deplorable crimes and further promote their names, padding their bank accounts. Woody Allen has been accused of molesting his adopted daughter Dylan O'Sullivan Farrow for years on end, but when his other daughter Ronan Farrow spoke out to actors who were working with Allen, she was met with criticism. Ignoring the disgusting convictions of these men only because they are famous and arguably create good art is an insult to rape survivors and the women in these abusive situations. The fact is that the world would go on if the radio did not play Chris Brown. If Woody Allen never made another movie, no one would die. The world has so much beautiful art created by moral, decent individuals that we lose nothing by not consuming art from the celebrities who have violated the women in their lives. When you excuse these actions for A-Listers, you excuse the actions of the people in mainstream society committing these crimes, too. Donald Trump was caught on video admitting to assaulting women and was still elected president. Why do we ignore these deplorable actions in favor of “a good party song” or a “timeless classic movie”?If the people that millions of adolescents are looking up to can assault women and get away with it, that is sending a horrible message. In order to combat rape culture, we need to hold everyone who commits these crimes accountable, regardless of their social stature. \",\n",

       "  'date': '9/22/2017',\n",
       "  'body': 'The U.S. Department of Education is rescinding guidance on how universities should conduct investigations of sexual assault.The two hotly contested pieces of guidance — released in 2011 and 2014 under the Obama administration — set expectations for how universities like IU should investigate reports of sexual assault made by students.The guidance, which set standards of proof to be used by university investigators and time frames for these investigations, were adopted in university policy nationwide. They will now be replaced with a new interim Q&A guide established by the Department of Education.The announcement came Friday in a press release from the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, which issues federal guidance and evaluates schools’ responses to reports of campus rape.A letter, also released Friday by the Department of Education, explained the decision to revoke prior guidance: “The 2011 and 2014 guidance documents may have been well-intentioned, but those documents have led to the deprivation of rights for many students — both accused students denied fair process and victims denied an adequate resolution of their complaints.”U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced plans earlier this month to review the Obama-era guidance in a public notice and comment period, repeatedly calling the way schools currently investigate sexual assault “a failed system.”Friday’s newly released guidance outlines schools’ responsibility to address reports of sexual assault, offer interim measures such as counseling and modified class schedules and conduct equitable investigations led by a trained investigator.The new guidance does not establish a set time frame for universities to complete their investigations. The previous 60-day time frame established in 2011 guidance was a particular point of controversy, as some argued universities used this guideline as an excuse to rush universities investigations and place sanctions before compiling all evidence.\"This interim guidance will help schools as they work to combat sexual misconduct and will treat all students fairly,\" DeVos said in the press release. \"Schools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on. There will be no more sweeping them under the rug. But the process also must be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.\"This new guidance also called schools to complete sexual assault investigations with a written report summarizing all relevant evidence in a case — including that which could be considered exculpatory to students accused of assault. IU’s current sexual misconduct policy does not allow students to appeal university findings on a basis of exculpatory evidence found after a case has closed. Administrators told the IDS earlier this month that they are open to considering additional evidence after IU\\'s appeals period ends, but that the University has never overturned a students’ case on appeal after being found responsible in the IU system.The guidance released Friday also addressed the much-debated preponderance of evidence standard used in university investigations. This standard, lower than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard used in criminal cases, only states that universities must find that a student is more likely than not to have committed an act of sexual violence to sanction them.The new guidance suggested schools could come to decisions based on the preponderance of evidence standard or a more stringent clear and convincing standard that some schools used prior to the release of 2011 guidance.Katharine Liell, a Bloomington attorney who has represented dozens of students accused of sexual assault in IU\\'s system, praised the new federal guidance, suggesting the Department of Education is taking a step in the right direction.\"There\\'s a lot of suggestions that Indiana University could implement giving greater protections than are currently afforded to students,\" Liell said.She pointed to the University\\'s involvement of all aspects of handling reports of sexual assault — including investigations, deciding sanctions and granting appeals. Liell noted the new guidance allows IU ample opportunity to consider revising this and other aspects of its current sexual misconduct policy, including the training of University officials selected to hear sexual misconduct cases.\"I just don\\'t think when Indiana University plays all roles that anyone would call that impartial,\" Liell said.Students who have reported being sexually assaulted worry this change in federal guidance will lead to confusion among schools. Hailey Rial, a former IU-Bloomington student who reported sexual assault as a freshman, said she\\'s concerned this federal shift sends a message to students that their reports of sexual assault don\\'t matter at the University level.Rial said she sees the positives and negatives in reconsidering evidence standards, but that ultimately schools should refer these types of cases to police.\"Schools are not equipped to handle sexual assault,\" Rial said. \"It\\'s a criminal thing.\"IU released a statement Friday afternoon in response to federal changes, reaffirming the University\\'s commitment to ending sexual violence on campus.\"The September 22nd announcement by the Department of Education makes it clear that it remains the responsibility of the University to respond to any matter of possible sexual misconduct,\" the statement read. \"Indiana University will continue to offer and provide support and resources to those who need it; objectively and thoroughly investigate reports; and conduct any related proceedings in a manner that assures due process, as well as fairness and dignity to all participants.\"The University\\'s existing sexual misconduct policies already meet the federal guidance issued Friday, according to the IU statement, and the University will look to participate in formal rule-making procedures as the DeVos administration continues its open notice-and-comment period.The statement also suggested IU will continue to review its own policy as needed.\"The University remains in progress in continuing to update its sexual misconduct policy and procedures whenever necessary,\" the statement read. \"The work to review the policy and procedures cooperatively with staff, faculty, students and experts will continue.\"For more on how IU handles cases of sexual misconduct reported to the University, read the IDS investigation team\\'s four-part series on campus sexual assault here.',\n",

       "  'body': \"A 17-year-old girl's mother reported Eugene Ellis, 42, for sexual assault Wednesday after her daughter told her he had raped her. Ellis was arrested on rape charges after he allegedly assaulted a 17-year-old female Bloomington resident. The victim’s mother told police Ellis was a family member staying over at their house on the far south side of Bloomington on Tuesday night. She said he had stayed at their house many times in the past. The 17-year-old told police she went downstairs at about noon when she saw Ellis sleeping on the couch. She said she heard him get up before he grabbed her by putting his arms around her torso from behind. The teenager told police Ellis then picked her up, put her face-down on a lounge chair and held her arms and head back while he took off her shorts and underwear. She said he then raped her. She told police she tried to get away by kicking, pushing and screaming at him. But about 10 minutes later, he allegedly grabbed her again, put her on the couch and raped her for the second time. After the alleged assault, Ellis left through the front door, and the victim got up to call her friends and family members. One of those family members was her mom, who reported the incident and later took her daughter to the hospital for a rape kit. Police found Ellis at his friend’s house on the far south side of Bloomington. His friend said he knew nothing about the alleged rape. Ellis told police he left work at McDonald’s at 6 a.m. before going to the 17-year-old and her mother’s house and sleeping on their couch until noon. He said he and the teenager were alone, but they did not do anything sexual. Later, he told police that he and the 17-year-old did have oral sex, but he said it was consensual. Ellis denied raping the 17-year-old girl. Police arrested Ellis for rape, a third-degree felony, and criminal confinement. He was booked into the Monroe County Jail. Christine Fernando\",\n",

As the University conducts its own investigation of these reports, students are routinely denied timely access to evidence, are made to advocate for themselves and are compelled to participate under the threat of academic holds. But it doesn’t have to be this way. In a yearlong investigation, the IDS found room for change in IU policy and examples of how other schools handle these cases differently.

       "  'body': \"Bloomington resident Alexandre Buitendorp, 22, has pleaded not guilty on preliminary charges related to an alleged rape that occurred in March. Buitendorp appeared in court for an initial hearing on Thursday afternoon in front of Bloomington lawyer Joe Lozano, who was filling in for Judge Teresa Harper. He indicated that he wanted a public defender appointed to him and stated under oath that he was a manager at a McDonald's and didn’t make more than $1,400 in a single month. The Bloomington Police Department arrested Buitendorp on Tuesday. According to the probable cause affidavit filed Wednesday, investigators identified him with the help of the woman who had reported the assault, which occurred after the two had been drinking at Kilroy’s Sports Bar. The defendant had a probation hold from Elkhart County, which prevents the jail from releasing him without proper approval from authorities in the other jurisdiction. He had five supporters in the audience during the hearing, which did not last more than a few minutes. One of those supporters raised his hand to ask Lozano how they could go about securing Buitendorp’s bond. The woman told police she began speaking to the man, who was not her friend, after her friends had left the bar. From there, she said that her memory became hazy and that she told police she remembered waking up in the passenger seat of a vehicle with Buitendorp assaulting her with his hand, and then passing out again. She said she remembered waking up again at her own residence without clothing. The woman told police the date rape drug GHB was found in her system through a toxicology report. She said she does not use illegal drugs. Buitendorp agreed to an interview with detectives when they contacted him at the time.He initially told police he walked with the woman to her house, but then he admitted he was lying and said he had driven the car with her inside. He said he and the woman had kissed outside his car and engaged in sexual acts inside the car. A detective requested a DNA swab, and he complied, saying that everything that occurred during the night in question was consensual and that he was 100 percent certain he did not have sexual intercourse with the woman.On Aug. 11, the detective received the results of the DNA analysis from a rape kit conducted at Bloomington Hospital on March 26. The sample provided by Buitendorp matched the DNA profile of sperm found during the rape kit, according to the affidavit, indicating that he misled police when he was questioned. Buitendorp has also been charged with multiple counts related to his use of the woman’s cellphone on the night in question. He told police he had lost his phone and was using the woman’s phone to locate it. He allegedly communicated with the woman’s friends to determine the location of her house after having left to find his phone. The woman’s cellphone was returned to a male friend. Buitendorp had assured police he only took the woman’s phone in order to locate his own, which he said he found on the street. Police found probable cause to arrest him given that the woman’s inebriation prevented her from consenting to any sexual activity.Buitendorp has a bail review hearing scheduled for Sept. 19 and a pretrial conference scheduled for Nov. 6.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Among sex, singing and sword-fighting, Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” is widely considered “the perfect opera,” and it is opening at the Musical Arts Center on behalf of the Jacobs School of Music on Friday. “Don Giovanni” follows its namesake as Don Giovanni seduces a string of women and avoids the consequences of his hedonistic lifestyle. Known as a drama giocoso, it contains elements of both drama and comedy.“As far as Mozart’s operas go, it\\'s incredibly entertaining,” Director David Lefkowich said. “The serious parts are really serious, but we laugh at the situation that’s happening. There’s not a lot of operas that toe that line so beautifully.”The show is double-cast, meaning two sets of actors will alternate performance nights. With only a two-week rehearsal process, Lefkowich left much character interpretation to the actors, Bruno Sandes, the actor playing Don Giovanni, said.“He has given us freedom to take any kind of approach to the characters,” Sandes said. “You’re gonna see two shows. They’ll probably be very different in the way every single character is portrayed.”Mozart wrote “Don Giovanni” late in his life. The show, written in 1787, contains areas where one actor sings alone, but there are also times when an ensemble sings together, something uncommon to operas from this time period. “You can feel the layers and the age and the wisdom he’s accumulated,” Lefkowich said. “This one feels more mature than his earlier works.”The opera runs just less than three hours. Though the opera is long, the music and story keep things interesting for the audience, Lefkowich said.“Mozart sets up some incredible themes at the beginning, but it takes a little time for these to develop,” Lefkowich said. “When you get to that last finale and you hear the culmination of everything that has come before, it’s jaw-droppingly incredible.”The music is as important to the audience as it is to the characters. Don Giovanni uses music and singing in his seduction tactics. “He plays with words; he uses charm, but when he needs to go farther, he uses music,” Sandes said.Three characters in the show are victims of Don Giovanni’s sexual advances. Lefkowich said this show does not sweep sexual assault under the rug but puts it in a position of acknowledgment.“What this story shows is that being a victim does not make you weak,” Lefkowich said. “We want to empower them to overcome what has happened, instead of suffering alongside them.”Though originally in Italian, the story is made understandable by supertitles displayed above the set as well as the actors\\' performances. The cast worked to make sure the story is paramount above everything, Lefkowich said.“If I can make the audience forget about their problems for two minutes and be with me in the show with Don Giovanni, part of my goal is achieved,” Sandes said.This uncut production of “Don Giovanni” includes every scene and piece of music from Mozart’s original writing, as well as musical lines repeated for clarity. Whether experienced in opera or a novice, there is something interesting to hook into, Lefkowich said.“The quality of the show, the singers, the directors, the orchestra, the maestro, they are some of the things you can only see in some of the best theaters in the world,” Sandes said.“Don Giovanni” runs from Sept. 15 to 23. Tickets start at $10.This story has been updated at 1:53 p.m. Sept. 15 to reflect a correction. \"Don Giovanni\" will open at the Musical Arts Center and not at the IU Auditorium as previously stated. This story was again updated Sept. 18 to correct the ticket prices. ',\n",

       "  'body': 'Jason Casares served as the director of IU’s Office of Student Ethics for five and a half years, overseeing all University investigations of sexual misconduct, until last year when the administrator himself was accused of sexual assault. In his time at IU, the Office of Student Ethics adopted a 40-hour sexual violence training module, received more than $250,000 in additional funding and accepted multiple national awards, according to Casares’ personal website.He spoke regularly at student affairs conferences and served as president-elect of the Association for Student Conduct Administration — a national organization that offers training for student conduct offices at universities across the country.But for Casares, everything changed with a tweet.Feb. 3, 2016, Jill Creighton, an administrator at New York University, tweeted an open letter to members of the ASCA, accusing Casares of taking advantage of her after having too much to drink at a December 2015 Association of Fraternity/Sorority Advisors convention in Fort Worth, Texas.The day before, the ASCA announced in a press release that Casares had resigned his position as president-elect of the student conduct organization, providing no reason. Some time shortly before the announcement, Creighton was named the new ASCA president-elect.“As we speak on moral courage, I share mine,” Creighton said in a tweet. “You voted me President-Elect, please read my open letter to you. #asca16”As we speak on moral courage, I share mine. You voted me President-Elect, please read my open letter to you: https://t.co/17bwRuu38b #asca16In the one-page letter, Creighton wrote that Casares resigned his role as president-elect after Creighton requested his impeachment from the ASCA. She filed a report with the Fort Worth Police Department and said she asked the association to cancel sessions at which Casares was scheduled to speak during an annual ASCA conference set for February 2016. The ASCA did not cancel Casares’ speaking engagement, so Creighton took to Twitter during the week of the conference.“I ... could not stand the hypocrisy of Jason parading his expertise on Title IX, knowing how he had behaved with me,” Creighton said in a tweet Things unfolded quickly after Creighton’s tweet.The ASCA released a letter to its members the next day stating the association hired an independent law firm to investigate Creighton’s allegations, and the review ultimately found Creighton’s claims to be unsubstantiated.The same day, IU confirmed that Casares had been placed on paid administrative leave from his position as an associate dean of students and announced a review of all cases Casares had overseen as a sexual misconduct hearing panel chair dating back to August 2015.Casares’ attorney denied Creighton’s claims in a statement to media, calling her tweets “inappropriate and false public statements.” Neither Casares nor Creighton responded to requests to be interviewed for this series.Casares resigned from IU in late February 2016, but he didn’t speak publicly until after a Fort Worth police investigation found no cause to press charges. “A false and wrongful allegation of sexual assault, publicly levied against me, has been and continues to be the toughest challenge of my life,” Casares wrote in his blog, adding that it “remains the most harmful and life-altering experience I have ever endured. And, it will not break me.”In April 2016, IU announced that its review, conducted by IU Maurer School of Law Professor Emerita Julia Lamber, found no “bias or undue influence” in cases heard by Casares in fall 2015.Today, Casares keeps a low profile, occasionally tweeting about the Chicago White Sox, his family and trends in higher education. He is now a consultant, according to his website, and has tweeted from multiple leadership-building conferences.“The passion is still there,” Casares wrote in his April 2016 blog. “The commitment is there. And I will continue that work just like our colleagues and professionals who have experienced sexual assault themselves, who continue to do their work in objective ways as investigators and panel members of Title IX hearings.”Since Casares’ resignation, staff at the Office of Student Ethics — recently renamed the Office of Student Conduct — has changed almost entirely. Harold ‘Pete’ Goldsmith, dean of students at the time of Casares’ resignation, spoke to the IDS in March 2016 and apologized to students.“I certainly understand their concerns,” Goldsmith said. “I think with Mr. Casares’ resignation, we hope to restore whatever trust has been eroded, and we’ll do everything that we can to do that.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Bloomington resident Alexandre Buitendorp was arrested Tuesday on rape charges stemming from an alleged assault that occurred in March.The investigation began March 26 when detectives responded to a Bloomington Hospital report of a sexual assault that occurred the previous night, Bloomington Police Department Lt. John Kovach said. A 22-year-old woman told police she had been out with friends at a local bar and spoke with an individual later identified as Buitendorp, who Kovach said is not her friend but may be associated with her friends. She said at some point she blacked out, and the next thing she remembered was waking up in a vehicle with her pants pulled down and the alleged attacker assaulting her with his hand. The next thing the woman told police she remembered was waking up in her own residence without Buitendorp present and having no recollection of the previous night’s events, apart from what she had already told detectives. Kovach said police located Buitendorp and interviewed him. At the time, he denied the allegations.Lab results from the rape kit detected the presence of GHB, a date rape drug, in the woman’s system, in addition to semen in her genital area. The results did not come back until recently. Buitendorp was questioned again and presented with the new findings Tuesday.He denied giving her the drug or having intercourse with the woman but said he remembers kissing her in the vehicle, Kovach said. Buitendorp told police that the interaction was consensual, but police determined the drugs detected in the woman’s system combined with alcohol disputed this and was probable cause to arrest him. Buitendorp will face a preliminary hearing Thursday afternoon.Jesse Naranjo',\n",

       "  'body': \"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos declared last week the methods by which college campuses handle sexual assault constitute a “failed system.” In a speech at George Mason University, DeVos said the Obama administration “burdened schools with increasingly elaborate and confusing guidelines” that her department now intends to review and improve.When 11.2 percent of all students and 23.1 percent of female undergraduates, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, experience rape or sexual assault, and two-thirds of all episodes of sexual violence are unreported, DeVos has good reason to say the system has failed.What she does not have good reason to propose is that the priorities in repairing this failed system should lie anywhere other than with the victims – not of failed due process, but of sexual violence.Given both the statistical likelihood and social consequence of sexual assault, reparations should begin with the victims.Even if it were not for the compulsion of human decency to be attentive to survivors of sexual violence, the logical clarity available when one tries to minimize harm necessitates that we improve the process by which students report sexual assault and the quality of the legal counsel reporting students receive.Of all reported sexual assaults, the vast majority are true accounts. Three different studies on sexual assault accusations in United States communities published by the National Sexual Violence Resource Center indicate that between 2 and 10 percent of accusations are false, which suggests that we would be fair in directing our attention first toward the more prevalent and therefore urgent issues that affect survivors. While the Editorial Board recognizes the necessity to provide all students with due process, and while we also recognize the concern that accused students may be seen as guilty until proven innocent, we would like to emphasize that only seven of every 1,000 instances of rape cases result in a felony conviction for the accused.And, of course, as Brock Turner's case brings to light, these reprimands are often heinously insensitive to the severity of the crime. We feel that DeVos' suggestion of alternative models for the handling of sexual assault will level disproportionate harm on survivors if greater legal protections are granted to accused parties prior to the implementation of such measures as, for example, clarification of Obama-era guidelines and improved treatment of students who report.DeVos cited a female student who was required to assemble her own case at a university disciplinary hearing. “Without any legal training whatsoever, she had to prepare an opening statement, fix exhibits and find witnesses,” DeVos said.And yet, her seeming delicacy in understanding the gravity of sexual assault is tarnished by some ill-made remarks. For instance, she once said, “Any perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation.” She also said, “If everything is harassment, then nothing is.” The tone of DeVos' speech, as well as the context of the Trump administration’s influence on whatever reforms the Department of Education suggests and implements, gives us reason to fear that the system will continue to fail.Apparently, the reform process will begin with “a transparent notice-and-comment process” that considers public feedback.Well, Secretary DeVos, notice our comment: Survivors’ lives are in your hands. Do not let them down. The Editorial Board wrote contrasting opinions on Betsy DeVos and Title IX. Read the dissenting editorial here.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'In a room of 12 college students, at least one has planned his or her own death. He or she might have chosen a day to die, typed out a preparatory last goodbye to friends and family that lurks in the hidden folders of a laptop. Maybe the day passed, the plan forgotten, as so many plans of college students are. Maybe not.  No matter the circumstances, the statistic stands: one in 12.The number comes from a 2016 National Data on Campus Suicide and Depression report, and there’s no shortage of similar statistics. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 15 and 34. The 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that of every age group, adults from ages 18 to 25 were most likely to have serious suicidal thoughts. National Suicide Prevention Week, which runs Sept. 10-16, allows IU mental health organizations to raise awareness as they offer support for struggling students. “We’re in such a new environment, especially for freshmen,\" senior Korie Rice, a psychology major, said. \"They just moved away from home. They’re in a dorm. They’re in a new place. The college environment is so much more intense in so many different ways.\"Rice is communications director for U Bring Change 2 Mind, an IU organization aiming to reduce stigma surrounding mental health on campus.Part of UBC2M’s efforts this week is a dinner and discussion on the popular but controversial Netflix original series “13 Reasons Why” to be held at 7 p.m. on Sept. 21 at the Indiana Memorial Union. The show, released in late March of this year, is the most tweeted about television show of 2017, according to a Variety report based on exclusively obtained Twitter data. However, the show received criticism from mental health professionals, parents and educators for its portrayal of suicide and mental illness. Dr. Victor Schwartz is the chief medical director for the JED foundation, a nonprofit promoting suicide prevention and improved mental health services on college campuses. When “13 Reasons Why” premiered on Netflix, JED released viewing guides and discussion questions to help audiences better understand the issue. Schwartz said that while the show raised awareness, it could also potentially be harmful.“On the one hand, the show did get a tremendous amount of attention brought, attention to concerns around sexual assault, bullying, people mistreating each other, depression and suicide,” he said. “We at JED had concerns about some of the artistic choices that were made and the way the show was done. We were concerned that there was some potential for putting some vulnerable people at greater risk.”For National Suicide Prevention Week, JED is more active on social media and in reaching out to colleges. The organization works closely with universities through its JED Campus program, providing consulting and guidance over a four-year period to improve mental health services. While IU isn’t a JED Campus, the organization still provides online resources and spot consultations in the event of a student suicide. Schwartz said that JED’s focus on colleges is due to different vulnerabilities that are a part of campus life. Universities are self-contained communities, increasing the risk of suicide contagion — an increase in suicide or suicidal behaviors as a result of exposure to suicide within a community. However, Schwartz also said that working within the university system makes outreach easier. “The fact is that colleges, because they are contained and organized, they’re a great opportunity to provide support resources and provide care in ways that are difficult for people just living out in the world,” he said. Another effort from UBC2M during National Suicide Prevention Week is the promotion of the Out of the Darkness community walk. The walk, to be held in October, is a fundraiser sponsored by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention that welcomes the Bloomington community to participate and raise money and awareness for suicide prevention. Rice, the captain for the UBC2M team for the upcoming event, attributes her passion about suicide prevention to her own struggles with mental illness in the past. She started a suicide prevention program in high school after seeing the lack of mental health resources, and later continued the work in college. She said that she found hope in the community at IU and encourages others to do the same.“Anything we can do to reduce these suicide rates is so vital,” she said. “To those who are struggling or know someone who is struggling, don’t be afraid to reach out. There is so much hope in so many areas that you don’t even know about.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said last week that she will review the guidance for addressing sexual assault on college campuses. DeVos said she thinks the Obama administration went too far in an attempt to protect victims, ultimately infringing on the due process of those accused.Though DeVos is a contentious education secretary to say the least, she is absolutely right on this issue. Due process is a fundamental right granted to Americans through the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. And although campus hearings are not government courts of law, public universities, which are government entities, should be beholden to the same standards.Currently, too many campus hearings at public colleges – for sexual assault or other charges – look like this: The accused is ushered into a room where a single arbitrator or a small group of university employees unilaterally decides the fate of the person. Depending on the college, the accused may not be allowed to call witnesses or bring forth any evidence.Even in IU's system, where the accused may suggest witnesses and produce evidence, the time frame to do so leaves students scrambling. Who is allowed to speak, what evidence is brought forth and who decides responsibility are all determined by the university. It’s ridiculous to believe that this process could ever be impartial, and it’s even more ridiculous to expect 20-year-old people without the right to let an attorney defend them to defend themselves. In IU's case specifically, attorneys are allowed to be present, but they cannot speak.In criminal trials, the accused is innocent until proven guilty, but campuses have perverted this American standard of justice and now force the accused to prove his or her innocence. News outlets as varied as National Public Radio, the Washington Examiner and the Atlantic have criticized current campus sexual assault policy. Universities have gone beyond providing support to victims and now wholly disregard the rights of the accused.Though those who criticize DeVos’ stance, like Lucia Graves in the Guardian, claim that DeVos is simply protecting the entitled white male masses that helped elect Donald Trump. We wholeheartedly understand why people distrust the Trump administration, but advocating for due process on campuses should not be met with scorn.Currently, campus sexual assault is treated as an inherently different crime than all others, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. Additionally, the standard of proof is much lower than in criminal trials – a mere preponderance of the evidence is needed to find someone guilty on campus.This means that those determining guilt need only find that it's more likely than not that the alleged student is responsible. No crime should treat the accused as guilty until proven innocent, but those who criticize DeVos simultaneously want the Trump administration to be able to determine what crimes warrant this special status of proving innocence.Giving the government the power to suspend due process for any reason weakens the civil liberties of all Americans. Public universities need to treat those accused of sexual assault with the same presumption of innocence as those accused in courts. Due process is one of the most important tenets in the American legal system, and public universities that disregard it are actively telling students that their rights don’t matter.The Editorial Board wrote contrasting opinions on Betsy DeVos and Title IX.

The chapter’s standards board formally expelled the accused member and required him to move out of the chapter facility.

Because there is no ongoing search for a suspect, Munroe said the department decided not to send a notification.“Since we did know the individual involved, we did not consider the individual a threat to the community right now,” he said.IUPD often sends these notifications to comply with the Clery Act, which requires universities that receive any federal funding to report campus crime data, outline campus safety policies and support victims of violence.Munroe said the question of consent often arises during parties on campus. He said he wants students to be aware of what consent is and to take time to ask one another ‘Yes?’ or ‘No?’ before continuing in sexual activity.“There can’t be a question of consent,” he said about IU\\'s policy of consent. “It has to be absolutely ‘yes.’ Without a ‘yes,’ there is no consent.”Christine FernandoThis story has been updated with a statement from Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and to reflect that IUPD will no longer pursue the investigation.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The way universities investigate sexual assault could be changing. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced the first steps in replacing federal guidance that suggests how universities like IU should respond to student reports of sexual assault.DeVos\\' announcement came Thursday afternoon in a George Mason University speech that was streamed live on the Department of Education’s Facebook page. In her speech, DeVos said her department would begin a public notice and comment period seeking alternatives to Obama-era Title IX guidance that, she said, “comes far too short for far too many students.”Title IX, which broadly states that no person should face discrimination on a basis of sex, requires every university to have systems in place to address reports of sexual assault. The Department of Education has provided further frameworks for how universities can meet these requirements through guidance letters issued by the department’s Office of Civil Rights.DeVos came out strongly against this guidance today, repeatedly referencing the “failed system” it has created at universities across the country. She said these guidelines have become elaborate and confusing, difficult even for lawyers to understand.“There must be a better way forward,” DeVos said.This guidance has become highly controversial in recent years. Lawyers argue that it gives schools the ability to conduct ad hoc trials in which university officials untrained in the legal profession serve as the judge, jury and executioner for sexual misconduct cases carrying heavy consequences for students.In her speech, DeVos discussed this characterization of university sexual misconduct systems. She outlined a stark picture of hearing processes in which students are denied due process rights, only to receive them by suing their own university. She pointed to what she sees as faults in these systems, including students being denied adequate knowledge of charges brought against them, and those same students being made to play the role of a lawyer in their own defense in schools’ judicial conferences.DeVos called the practice shameful and wholly un-American.“Survivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved,” DeVos said. \"That’s why we must do better, because the current approach isn’t working.”In her speech, DeVos provided examples from students and parents she consulted with in a series of listening sessions convened by the Department of Education last July. She noted the story of a student who became suicidal after his involvement in a sexual misconduct report, and of another student whose alleged rapist walked free after first being found responsible in a university hearing and then winning a lawsuit in response to that university’s treatment of his case.“We need to remember we are not just talking about faceless cases,” DeVos said. “We are talking about people’s lives.”She suggested universities look to organizations like the American Bar Association and the American College of Trial Lawyers that have studied this issue and provided their own guidance on how to better navigate sexual misconduct reporting.DeVos outlined one specific suggestion for how these cases could be better handled. Rather than conducting their own investigations, she said schools should be allowed to opt in to a regional partnership in which professionally trained experts, working with states and their attorneys general, investigate reports of a criminal level with the help of law enforcement. “This model allows educators to focus on what they do best — educate,” DeVos said.IU released a statement Thursday afternoon in response to DeVos\\' comments reiterating its commitment to addressing issues of sexual violence.\"We will continue to respond to all reports of possible sexual misconduct by offering and providing support and resources to those who need it, by objectively and thoroughly investigating reports and by conducting any related proceedings in a manner that assures due process, as well as fairness and dignity to all participants,\" the statement read.It also stated that IU will assess its own policies to ensure compliance with federal law and would participate in any changes to come to federal guidance to \"assure protections for victims and fairness to all.\"Comments to DeVos’ press conference on the Department of Education’s Facebook live video have been overwhelmingly negative. Many fear changes in the department\\'s stance on sexual violence cases will discourage students from reporting.Trust in the department\\'s understanding of campus rape was beleaguered when Candice Jackson, the acting head of the department\\'s Office of Civil Rights, was quoted in a July New York Times article saying, \"Rather, the accusations — 90 percent of them — fall into the category of \\'we were both drunk,\\' \\'we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.\\'\"Jackson later publicly apologized for the comments that outraged victims\\' rights advocates, calling them \"flippant.\"DeVos made it clear in her speech Thursday that acts of sexual violence are not to be tolerated at university campuses. She said the goal of the announced notice and comment period was to elicit public feedback and transparency for a system she feels has far too long failed students.“No one benefits from a system that doesn’t have the public’s trust,” DeVos said.Carley Lanich',\n",

       "  'body': 'Welcome to chapter three of the book column. September is almost upon us, so I thought I would take the opportunity to tell readers about all the great books being released this month. I am going to cover five books that are must-reads for this month. A few are by authors I have been reading for years, so I can say from experience that these books should capture your attention.  Publishing first this month is a young adult contemporary novel, \"Genuine Fraud\" by E. Lockhart. Lockhart is also the author of the New York Times best seller, \"We Were Liars.\"The writing in \"We Were Liars\" was creative, bordering on poetic. The story provided a new perspective on a classic plot twist. It surprised me at every turn of the page. I adored this book, so I have high expectations for \"Genuine Fraud.\" Lockhart’s newest release is a story of Imogen and Jule. In the story, one young woman uses her intelligence to transform herself into a million different identities.\"Genuine Fraud\" will be a mystery that includes thrills, romance and intrigue, and it will be released Sept. 5. Add it to your list, fast.  Next up on my list of must-reads for September is \"One Dark Throne\" by Kendare Blake. \"One Dark Throne\" is the sequel to another of Blake’s novels, \"Three Dark Crowns.\" Blake’s book is another young adult novel on my list, but this one is fantastical rather than contemporary. Fans of \"The Hunger Games\" will go crazy for this one. In \"One Dark Throne,\" the three sisters introduced in the first book continue to fight for their place as queen on the island of Fennbirn. The book is filled with magic and powers beyond readers\\' wildest dreams. One of the sisters can control animals. Another can control the elements, and a third is immune to poisonings. \"One Dark Throne\" will be released Sept. 19.  Moving away from the young adult category, but also releasing on Sept. 19, is \"The Best Kind of People\" by Zoe Whittall. Whittall’s newest novel is a mystery told from an interesting perspective. In the book, a Connecticut town’s beloved school teacher is arrested under suspicion of sexual assault.Readers are told the story not from the point of view of the victims but from the teacher’s family. So far, advanced reviews of this novel on Amazon and Good Reads are all positive. If you are looking for a mystery to grip you this fall, pick up Whittall’s \"The Best Kind of People.\"Along with some of the great fiction novels coming out in September, Hillary Clinton is bringing the country a nonfiction book. Clinton’s newest book, \"What Happened\" will be a tell-all of the 2016 electoral race. Those deeply interested in politics will want to pick this one up Sept. 12. In a quote from the introduction of the book, Clinton claims she is \"letting all her walls down with this one.\"I’ll acknowledge that I’m not very interested in politics, but even I plan on giving this book a read when I have time.The final book that makes my list for September’s must-read releases is \"Sleeping Beauties\" by Owen and Stephen King. Stephen King might be one of the most well-known, present-day horror authors.Stephen has written more than 50 novels and many short stories on his own. However, for his latest novel, Stephen enlisted the help of his son Owen.Together, the father-son writing duo crafted \"Sleeping Beauties,\" a tale of what happens when one day all the women in the world don’t wake up. All the women are trapped in cocoons, except one. This thrilling dystopian novel will be released Sept. 26. That’s all for my list of must-reads in September, but be sure to do a quick Google search for other books that I didn’t include on this list. You will find no shortage of upcoming novels and nonfiction reads to indulge in this fall.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Update 7:24 p.m. Monday: In a letter to the editor sent to the IDS, Provost Lauren Robel said her concerns about Kilroy\\'s Recess opening were reaffirmed by the tweet which she described as \"gross\" and \"insensitive.\" Robel urged students to take advantage of other opportunities at IU like the cinema, performances and clubs. \"I encourage students to find a home in these activities and to avoid places that make disrespect for women and for the safety of our community a part of their marketing plans,\" Robel said. Update 1:13 p.m. Sunday: Kilroy\\'s Recess has removed the ability to leave a review on its Facebook page, and the 1.1 star average rating has disappeared. Its Twitter is now set to protected mode.  Update 12:17 a.m. Sunday: After seemingly being deleted, the Kilroy\\'s Recess Facebook page is online. The average rating out of 30 reviews is 1.1 stars.Update 12:03 a.m. Sunday: Nicole Freeman, director of marketing for Kilroy\\'s, has issued an apology on the Recess Twitter account.Update 10:03 p.m.: Kilroy\\'s Recess has deleted its Facebook page. A spokesperson for Switchyard Brewing, a Bloomington brewery opening in January 2018, said in a Twitter video statement that the business will not distribute beer to any Kilroy\\'s location because of Recess\\' tweet.When Mark Cuban was a student at IU almost 40 years ago, the building that now holds Kilroy\\'s Recess was home to Cuban\\'s own bar, Motley\\'s Pub. Cuban ventured back to Bloomington on Friday night, posting an Instagram video from Nick\\'s English Hut. Recess hoped to bring him back into 430 E. Kirkwood Ave., so they invited him in a tweet.“We got rid of the wet t-shirt contests, but kept the underage girls [sic],” part of the tweet said.As the tweet implied, Motley\\'s closed down in 1981, after less than a year of business, because it allowed underage patrons and wet T-shirt contests, according to the Dallas Morning News. The tweet has since been deleted, but screenshots continue to circulate Twitter and other social media. The College Democrats at IU used a screenshot to create a response tweet of their own. “Bloomington is better than this,” the tweet said. “If we, as a community, want to tackle rape culture in any capacity, comments like this can’t be tolerated.\"Terry Tossman, president of College Democrats at IU, said the group plans to release a formal statement Sunday morning. He also said hopes to work with other student groups and the IU administration to make sure rape culture is not normalized at Recess and other bars in the Bloomington community.“This tweet was just inappropriate by Recess, and we as College Democrats do not tolerate rape or assault of any kind,” Tossman said.The Monroe County chapter of the National Organization for Women also sent out a tweet blaming Recess for perpetuating rape culture. Monroe County NOW\\'s post included the Recess tweet and a picture of a sign that Kilroy’s on Kirkwood displayed Monday. The sign was eclipse themed, encouraging patrons to get drunk enough to black out while the moon blacked out the sun. They tagged multiple accounts, including It’s On US, an anti-sexual assault campaign with an active Big Ten partnership. Laura Collins, acting president of Monroe County NOW, said she found out about the original tweet from a friend’s Facebook post.“It’s just gross,” Collins said. Although patrons of Recess must be at least 18 and therefore of legal age, many young women have never been in a nightclub before. Because of this, they may not understand the risks of entering this potentially predatory environment, Collins said.“It seems very irresponsible,” Collins said. “There are ways they can promote their nightclub without promoting this behavior.” Collins, along with some online users, was concerned about the tweet\\'s message because it reminded her of Lauren Spierer, a junior textiles marketing major who disappeared after visiting Kilroy’s Sports Bar on June 3, 2011. Spierer, who was 20 at the time of her disappearance, has not been found.Kilroy’s Recess could not be immediately reached for direct comment on their Friday night tweet.The establishment’s online responses to the issue began at 8:08 a.m. Saturday after a Twitter user asked them if they wanted to explain the tweet.“Not really,” the Recess Twitter account replied. Another user tagged Cuban in a tweet, noting he was in Bloomington and asking what he thought.Although Cuban did not reply, Recess did.“Well he was there last night, so,” Recess said, ending the tweet with an emoji of a shrugging woman.Snapchats from the Kilroy\\'s area show Cuban in Kilroy\\'s on Kirkwood but not in Recess.This story will be updated.',\n",

The owner of the house reported that several flower pots on his patio had been broken. The incident took place on Friday.Police reported that the male suspect was unable to explain how his knuckles were injured and was taken to the hospital.Two of the other incidents involved a cement splash guard that was allegedly thrown through a car windshield Friday and a Circle K gas station toilet that was vandalized Sunday on South Walnut Street.Hit-and-Run reportsBloomington police received reports of three separate hit-and-runs between Friday and Sunday.The first case involved a Bloomington resident who was struck by a car while he was walking on a roadway near his house on South Lincoln Street Friday. His injuries included scrapes on his right knee and elbow.Another alleged hit-and-run occurred Saturday when, while driving, a man was rear-ended by another car. The first man’s wife spoke with the driver who then reportedly left the scene. The reported incident occurred on West Third Street and South Gates Drive.The third alleged hit-and-run was reported by an individual who said she was struck by a car parked outside her home Sunday.Sexual assault investigationAn 18-year-old female reported Sunday that she was touched inappropriately while on a first date. Bloomington police are investigating the incident for possible sexual assault and fondling.Police receive reports of 15 thefts in four daysPolice reported 15 thefts that occurred between Thursday, Aug. 17 and Sunday, Aug. 20.The alleged thefts involved a car stereo, a laptop, three cellphones, three bikes, $10 in change, cigarettes and a gray impact drill.Police also received reports Saturday of a robbery after three males allegedly stole a Bloomington man’s bag and cell before shooting at him and driving away on West Kirkwood Avenue.

       "  'body': \"The Office for Sexual Violence Prevention and Victim Advocacy set up its booth at the end of the space being used near Showalter Fountain for the Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll event. For some incoming freshmen at the Welcome Week event, talking with people from the new office may have been their first experience with IU’s efforts to prevent sexual violence.The Office for Sexual Violence Prevention and Victim Advocacy will bring together various teams that work to prevent sexual violence around campus, Leslie Fasone, the office's director, said. Confidential Victim Advocates, the Culture of Care student team and parts of Sexual Assault Crisis Services now operate together, helping students find resources by combining them into one group.“I think this will be another step forward, using past momentum and past initiatives to change the culture around sexual violence,” Fasone said.  Mandy Hussey, a marketing director for the IU Health Center and Division of Student Affairs, said the office is located in a house at 506 N. Fess Ave., near Collins Living-Learning Center. For her, the office’s preventative measures are a needed shift in how the University handles sexual violence.“There’s been a big call on campus to focus on prevention instead of just being a response team,” Hussey said.Fasone said her office will stress how many forms of violence, including dating violence, assault, harassment and stalking, will not be tolerated at IU.[The IDS has long been dedicated to covering sexual assault at IU. Read our three-part series from winter 2016 here: Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 and continue reading idsnews.com for an upcoming investigation.]Because the Office for Sexual Violence Prevention and Victim Advocacy mainly focuses on stopping sexual violence before it happens, some of the Sexual Assault Crisis Services will stay in the health center, Fasone said. Victims should still reach out to the health center to get assistance from specialized nurses and counselors if they have experienced an episode of sexual violence.“We thought it was important for students to have a place they could identify where they could go when they experience sexual violence,” Fasone said.One of the biggest changes that will be implemented this year through the office will be It’s on Us, a new in-person bystander intervention workshop for all first-year students. Graduate students will also have a similar program tailored to their needs.Fasone said this peer-to-peer training will accompany the education provided by the “Welcome to College” musical students see at orientation and the MyStudentBody online course. Organizers will make it easy for first-year students to complete It’s on Us by setting up workshop times in different residence halls in the coming months. This program helps make sexual violence prevention education an ongoing effort at IU, Fasone said. It is given in person to help provide students with context they might miss from the online lessons. “We're trying to tailor and adapt our workshops and information sessions based on student need,” Fasone said.At Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll, Emmalee Fishburn stood at the office’s booth in a gray Culture of Care T-shirt. It did not bear her title as the assistant director for Culture of Care, but it let the students wandering between tents know she oversees the student-led assault prevention team now aligned with the new office. Prevention and advocacy are the new office's main priorities, Fishburn said. The two-pronged approach will allow it to use what it learns in one branch to improve parts of the other.Fishburn is not a student, but she said she is excited to see how the campus culture might improve from the creation of the new office.“I hope that students can get a sense of feeling safe and supported from the office and know there is somewhere they can go,” Fishburn said.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Hundreds of students gathered in Woodburn Hall on Thursday night to walk through the Tunnel of Oppression an immersive experience that portrayed several scenes of hardship in front of a mostly freshman audience.“Our intent is not to offend anyone but rather to increase awareness and promote understanding,” said graduate supervisor Kate Chandley, one of the Tunnel’s tour guides.For the Welcome Week event, students were placed into groups of about 15 and guided through classrooms in Woodburn Hall. Actors in the scenes simulated portrayals of sexual assault, racism, homelessness, police brutality, eating disorders and body image. Afterward, group leaders led the participants in discussions on their reactions. Students were shown videos and skits during the simulations but were not allowed to talk through the duration of the experience. The discussion groups allowed them to voice their opinions.Many students said what they saw made them upset but left them unsurprised. Some shared their own experiences of friends and family members who went through hardships similar to those in the Tunnel of Oppression simulations. Some voiced feelings of hopelessness, especially after recent events like the white nationalist protests in Charlottesville. Freshman Ethan Tinsley said the event won’t get through to the people privileged enough to not think about these topics in their daily lives.  “I know that the people who actually need to come look at this won’t do it,” he said. “They react the way they do because they don’t know.” While the first four simulations provoked students in Tinsley’s group to reflect upon their own actions, the students reacted differently to the final simulation. The skit involved a black man getting pulled over in his car by a police officer. “What did I do?” the man asked, to which the officer had no reply. The officer then forced the man to exit the car, pinned him down and eventually shot him for resisting arrest.When the group discussed the police brutality scene, Tinsley said he felt doubtful about the possibility of change.“I just think it is a losing battle,” said Tinsley. “We can’t change the officers' mindsets.” Andi Cailles, director of resident life, led Tinsley and 14 other students in the discussion. While she said she understood Tinsley’s remark, she said the goal is to inspire the students to intervene in unjust situations.“Courage breeds courage,” Cailles said. “Students here have so many opportunities to educate themselves on situations like these, and hope starts with education.”\",\n",

       "  'body': 'In an Aug. 16 school-wide email addressing the “deeply disturbing” protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, organized by white nationalists, IU President Michael McRobbie stressed the importance of supporting students of all backgrounds. Although people in some parts of the country are speaking out against inclusive environments, IU is becoming increasingly diverse. The percentage of minority undergraduates has nearly doubled in the past 10 years, according to University Institutional Research and Reporting, leaping from 11.2 percent in 2006 to 21 percent in 2016. In this case, the term minority includes African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latinos, American Indians, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders and all multiracial students. Following the pattern of a small but steady increase every year, the class of 2021 is expected to be the most diverse of all, said John Nieto-Phillips, vice provost for educational inclusion and diversity. He said this has been accomplished through academic programs, cultural centers on campus and an overall welcoming environment. “There is absolutely no room at IU for discrimination or harassment based on anyone’s actual or perceived race, color, religion, creed, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin,” McRobbie said in the email.Academic achievement is the primary goal for all students, Nieto-Phillips said. “We’ve created a number of programs not only to recruit students, but to retain them, as well,” Nieto-Phillips said. These programs, such as the Groups Scholars program, provide intensive tutoring, student mentoring and financial support to ensure all students graduate in a timely manner. Eighty percent of Groups Scholars are underrepresented minorities, Nieto-Phillips said. A scholarship was created in 2013 to support student minority participation in studying abroad. In addition to academic support, there are five culture centers spread throughout campus, the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center, the Asian Culture Center, the First Nations Educational and Cultural Center, La Casa Latino Cultural Center and the LGBTQ+ Cultural Center.  “We’re really working to be attentive to every student’s needs,” Nieto-Phillips said. Freshman Quang Hoang is from Vietnam. He participated in the Intensive Freshman Seminars, which are part of a 16-day summer school program.As an international student, Hoang said he came to IU a week earlier than domestic IFS participants so that he could begin to adapt to America.“Everyone here is so supportive and friendly so my transition has been pretty smooth,” he said. As of 2016, international students represent 150 countries from across the globe. IU takes pride in its many cultures and strives to provide the same respect to every person, regardless of if they are involved with IU or not, McRobbie said in the email. “IU stands in solidarity with citizens and groups across our nation who oppose a supremacist ideology of bigotry, hatred, violence, intimidation and assault on our liberties,” McRobbie said in the email.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Any woman who dares to exist in public spaces can recount dozens of instances of sexual harassment. From leering and whistling to stalking and groping, all are damnable and all too familiar. Women can, however, take actions to achieve some restitution. I found several stories of harassment boil to the top of my brain while engrossed in “Everyday Sexism” by Laura Bates, the book inspired by the Everyday Sexism Project website. In a chapter on sexism in public spaces, Bates recalls a harassment case from the early morning hours of a workday – yes, sexism never sleeps – on her bike ride to the office. Mid-pedal, she is yelled at by a group of men at work along the sidewalk and, as a result, almost ends up in a car wreck. Shaking, she stomps over to call their supervising manager by the number on the company vehicle. Luckily, the manager on the end of the line takes her report seriously and files the incident.I slammed the book shut and looked up at my sister sitting across the table. “Did you know you could report a catcalling case by a construction crew by calling a managing officer and it would, at least … count for something?” I asked.“I’d never thought of that,” she said.Neither had I. Supposedly the phone number of a building company exists on the side of a semi truck in 256-point type for a reason, but I often don’t recognize the need to report cases of public sexual harassment the same way I might with other sex discrimination cases, even though they are just as serious. When sexual harassment happens, I recognize the bitter taste in my mouth and the anger in my heart. More often than not, though, I see it as another bullet of rape culture that someone as small as myself could never patch.Worst-case scenario, I feel as though there was something I must have done to deserve an unwanted comment, wink or touch. Comments from the women in my life such as: “Are you sure you want to be wearing that in public? You don’t want to hurt yourself,” or, “Don’t forget to bring your mace – don’t want to put yourself in a dangerous situation,” only fuel a fear that a catcall is my fault or, in fact, a compliment.But sexual harassment is neither of these. Sexual harassment in public spaces is a violation of consent and a form of sexual violence. No matter if the harasser physically grabs someone or stares predatorily, they overstep the boundaries of individuals trying to go about their day. Hollaback!, a global organization fighting street harassment, defines sexual harassment in public as “a power dynamic that constantly reminds historically subordinated groups (women and LGBTQ folks, for example) of their vulnerability to assault in public spaces.” This produces a feedback loop of sexual objectification in otherwise ordinary areas. No one consents to this type of behavior in any form, and it shouldn’t be seen as tolerable in any light.Stop Street Harassment, another organization that fights public sexual harassment and catcalling, commissioned survey research that found that 65 percent of American women had experienced street harassment. Among reporting women, 23 percent had been sexually assaulted, 20 percent had been stalked, and 9 percent had been coerced into sexual activity against their will. Public sexual harassment is nonconsensual and a form of gendered violence.Public sexual harassment is a part of our sexist, rape culture society — but it can be countered with small steps. If you don’t consent to comments or actions from others, then such behavior is never invited.',\n",

       "  'body': \"A handful of notable local criminal cases, some involving IU students and staff, are working their way through the court system. We’ve compiled updates on a handful of them below.Guoping WangFormer IU Jacobs School of Music instructor Guoping Wang was charged July 2016 with sexual battery and criminal confinement in connection with a 2015 assault of an IU ballet student. Wang allegedly brought the student into his office to practice stretches. He began to kiss her, and she pushed him away. She stood to leave, but Wang closed the door and blocked her from exiting. He then allegedly sexually assaulted her with his hands before a noise distracted him, and the student ran away. Wang entered a plea of not guilty in July 2016 and was released on bond, but online court records show he will have a change of plea hearing at 9 a.m. Oct. 11.Brittany Sater murder trialThree people were charged with the 2016 burglary, robbery and murder of Bloomington resident Brittany Sater. Johnny T. Moore, one of the three alleged co-conspirators, was tried and convicted of all charges in April. All witnesses to the shooting of Sater, including Sater herself in a video taken before her death, agree Moore was never in her house when Sater was shot. The other two alleged co-conspirators, Billie Jean “BJ” Edison and Dennis Webb, were allegedly in Sater’s home attempting to rob her when Webb shot her, according to court testimony. The prosecution argued Moore, who supplied drugs to Sater, orchestrated the robbery and murder. The jury agreed, and he was sentenced to 77 years in prison in May. He has since filed an appeal.The other two alleged co-conspirators, Edison and Webb, both initially entered pleas of not guilty. However, Edison is scheduled to have a change of plea hearing at 11 a.m. Oct. 4. Webb pleaded guilty to murder and robbery in July as a part of a plea deal. He will be sentenced at 9:30 a.m. Aug. 31.Whisper Four men, including two IU students and one IU graduate, were arrested in February on charges of child molestation after allegedly having sex with a 13-year-old girl they met on the social media app, “Whisper.”Police evidence suggests they knew she was underage. Matthew Filipek and George Pearcy were IU students at the time of their arrests. Thomas Snape graduated from the IU Kelley School of Business in 2015 with a degree in accounting, according to his LinkedIn page.Filipek entered a plea of not guilty in February. He is scheduled to appear in court at 3:15 p.m. Oct. 10 for a pretrial conference, a proceeding where the defense and prosecution update the court on the status of the case.Pearcy also entered a plea of not guilty in February. He is scheduled to appear in court at 2:30 p.m. Sept. 11 for a pretrial conference. Snape also entered a plea of not guilty in February. He was scheduled to appear in court at 2 p.m. Aug. 15 for a pretrial conference.James McGovernJames McGovern, an IU student at the time of his arrest, was charged with the rape and criminal confinement of another IU student in February after he met up with her at a bar downtown and brought her back to his apartment.He has entered a plea of not guilty and was released on bond. He is scheduled to appear in court at 1:30 p.m. Sept. 12 for a pretrial conference, a proceeding where the defense and prosecution update the court on the status of the case.Daniel MesselThe man convicted of murdering IU student Hannah Wilson was charged with a 2012 rape in the fall of 2016 after he was linked to the case by DNA evidence. Daniel Messel had begun serving his 80 year sentence for Wilson’s murder when he was charged with rape. He tried unsuccessfully in 2017 to appeal his murder conviction.The prosecution for the rape charge said during a pretrial conference Tuesday that the case will need to go to trial. Messel’s attorney, Patrick Schrems, said he will seek a change of venue for the trial. Schrems said the request will be made formally during Messel's next court appearance scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Oct 10.In the 2012 case, a student reported that a man she did not know offered her a ride after she had been out drinking, according to the probable cause affidavit. He drove her to a secluded parking spot in the woods near Griffy Lake, where he forced his penis into her mouth.She tried to fight him off, and he hit her so hard it “knocked the contact out of her eye and she was spitting blood,” according to the affidavit.The man drove away, and the student found help from residents nearby. The woman’s underwear was found at the scene the next day.After reading a news story about the Wilson case, the 2012 victim felt her case was “eerily similar” and called the IU Police Department to say she believed Messel might be her attacker.DNA collected in 2012 from under her fingernails was compared to Messel’s, and the samples matched. Messel was charged in 2016 with the rape a few months after his conviction for Wilson’s murder.\",\n",

       "  'body': '\"Game of Thrones\" is back on HBO, and while it\\'s narrative has caught up with creator George R.R. Martin\\'s \"Song of Ice and Fire\" novels, it still has roots in the same medieval history and literature that\\'s proved so influential to Martin. Weekend caught up with Professor Rosemarie McGerr, the director of IU\\'s Medieval Studies Institute, to discuss the characteristics of that period\\'s literature. \"Game of Thrones\" deals with these huge ideas about who should hold political power and how to govern a nation. How did medieval literature discuss politics?Medieval literature discussed politics in several ways. Some forms of medieval literature discussed political power and issues related to governing directly.These works discuss things like the education of kings, the importance of good laws for upholding justice and preventing tyranny, and the importance of choosing trustworthy counselors, as well as practical considerations in waging war. These works were primarily theoretical but often included examples of good and bad leaders from past history, classical literature, or the Bible.Sometimes these history books included information that was more legend than fact, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth’s Latin \"History of the Kings of Britain,\" which includes the first “biography” of King Arthur. This depiction of kingship aimed to impress the Norman nobility who had won rule of Britain by defeating the English in 1066 but did not know much about the British people. Most later tales about King Arthur focus less on the beginning or end of his kingship, but depict events during his kingship that indirectly examine issues of governance within his realm. Each time a new medieval author produced a tale about King Arthur, the new tale reflected concerns about how kings maintain peace and justice in the time and place the author was working, and that process of revising tales about King Arthur continues to this day.\"Game of Thrones\" tells all kinds of stories with its ensemble cast. Is their a quintessential story in medieval literature?I think there would be much debate about what could be called “the quintessential story in medieval literature”! What we think of as popular story structure now has a lot in common with basic story structure in medieval literature because they both reflect folktale patterns: a young hero — often with a secret past — faces a problem that endangers his future, so he travels in search of a solution and gains knowledge/powers/friends that help him overcome his opponents and win new identity and family or return home with security. Adventure stories in ancient and medieval literature that have supernatural elements have parallels with modern fantasy narratives.A threat that looms over the characters in \"Game of Thrones\" is the coming of Winter, at which point all sorts of beasts and, uh, snow zombies will descend upon the kingdom. What role do monsters play in medieval literature? What do monsters symbolically mean in it?Monsters play several roles in medieval literature and so can have different significances. What is a monster? Something unknown? Something “unnatural” that human beings cannot explain? Something unfriendly in nature? A beast that is stronger than a human being? A person who acts or looks like a beast?There are also really interesting medieval tales that explore the boundaries between what is human and non-human. For example, in the German poem Parzival by Wolfram von Eschenbach, there is a woman many characters consider monstrous when they first see her because has many beast-like physical characteristics, but she is extremely learned and she serves as a messenger for the community that cares for the Gral (later to become the Grail). When this character comes to King Arthur’s court to reveal that the handsome knight Parzival has failed in his task at the Gral castle, she tells him, “You think me monstrous, but you are more monstrous than I.” The poem also makes clear through another character that what might look like a monstrous external appearance is not as important as a person’s inner qualities.I would imagine all of the incest and incredible violence in \"Game of Thrones\" has historical roots. Can you tell me about the role violence and sex played in medieval literature?Medieval literature has much more explicit scenes of violence than explicit scenes of sex. Descriptions of battles can get quite graphic, which probably does reflect the kinds of injuries that occurred in combat with swords and axes; but torture descriptions are found in narratives about the martyrdoms of male and female Christian saints (flaying, boiling in oil, cutting off parts of bodies), and Christians were not being martyred in Europe when most of these tales were written down, so there is some question about whether the accounts reflect treatment of Christians elsewhere or Christian treatment of their enemies.Sexual assault and incest are not usually depicted in detail in medieval literature, but there are references to abductions of women, some of which might refer to sexual assault (the word for abduction in Latin is “raptus”). One famous tale of unknowing incest is (in some of the later stories) King Arthur’s affair with his half-sister before he marries Guinevere: in those versions of King Arthur’s life, this affair leads to the birth of Mordred.This interview was edited for content and clarity.',\n",

       "  'body': 'It seems reasonable to expect that rape survivors sympathize with other victims, that the authorities who are supposed to protect students actually do and that if anyone understands the difference between a rape myth and a reality on college campuses, it’s the head of the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights.But Candice Jackson, acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, proves us wrong.Last week, Jackson said in an interview with the New York Times that most campus sexual assault accusations are not about an aggressor overriding the will of a young man or woman.“Rather, the accusations—90 percent of them—fall into the category of ‘we were both drunk, we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right,’” she said.In other words, most campus sexual assault cases are unfounded.By all accounts of empirical, peer-reviewed research, Jackson is dead wrong.Her mythmaking continues a tradition of denial and trivialization of assault in our society.Numerous sociologists like David Lisakto, a clinical psychologist, and André De Zutter, a psychologist at Free University in Amsterdam, have analyzed FBI data, police records and court hearings and found that only 2 to 10 percent of sexual assault allegations were unfounded, baseless or false.In contrast, data compiled by the National Sexual Violence Resource Center found that 63 percent of sexual assaults are never reported to the police.IU’s 2014-2015 Sexual Climate survey found that 45 percent of undergraduate women at IU who reported being penetrated non-consensually did not consider the incident “serious enough” to be disclosed.Jackson’s comments—which she later half-regretfully called ‘flippant’—demonstrate the depth of her ignorance of campus sexual assault, even as a survivor herself.Her comment also falls neatly in the current administration’s vision of a more limited federal role in education and an erased Obama legacy.For example, the DoE recently announced that it is debating not publishing the list of colleges and universities under investigation for sexual violence reports.Jackson will scale back the requirements for federal investigators to search for systemic patterns of violations and the department’s budget proposal aims to cut staff positions at the Office of Civil Rights according to the New York Times.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has also considered rolling back Obama and Biden’s “Dear Colleague” letter, which threatens to withdraw federal funds if universities do not lower the standard of proof in sexual assault disciplinary hearings.Obama-era guidance on how universities handle sexual violence complaints does have genuine critics.A number of Harvard professors signed an open letter in opposition to the reforms, which they worried would made campus title IX offices de facto judge, jury and executioner, according to the Boston Globe.Most campus disciplinary hearings—which do not supersede the normal legal process—lack due process rights such as the right to cross-examine the witness, hire legal representation and be tried by a jury of one’s peers.Some accused-oriented advocates, such as Foundation for Individual Rights in Education have argued that the “preponderance of evidence” standard violates due process rights and burden of proof conventions.Critics of these plans have argued such requirements would discourage reporting and will confuse an internal disciplinary process with a court of law.Any changes to the DoE’s involvement in campus disciplinary hearings will have to be meticulously reasoned, supported by data and be motivated by compassion and concern for victims.Unfortunately, Jackson’s comments show she is not up for that task.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Sexism as violence pervades all aspects of women’s lives. Objectification, dehumanizing harassment and unsolicited sexual contact leaves a bitter but familiar taste on every woman’s tongue.University women, in particular, endure this treatment as they try to accomplish their professional and personal ambitions.But systemic sexism, coupled with university bureaucracies and police departments that often neglect the needs of assault survivors create cumbersome barriers for college women wanting to report an assault.This is why feminist policies like Title IX and successive sex-discrimination legislation must be enthusiastically adopted by universities to ensure a fair environment for students and to protect the livelihood of women on campus.Sexual violence statistics show that one in five women experience an attempted or completed assault while in college, according to the U.S. Department of Justice’s widely cited Campus Sexual Assault Survey.Eighty percent of these incidents among students age 18 to 24 go unreported, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Indiana University’s statistics aren’t far off from the national average.The 2014 Campus Climate Survey found that 17 percent of undergraduate women experienced attempted or completed rape while at IU. Eighty-six percent of those who experienced a sexual assault did not report the incident to a surveying IU facility.Title IX, a federal amendment passed in 1972, was widely regarded as a revolutionary and controversial sex discrimination law that prevented women in universities and educational programs from being discriminated against or denied basic rights on the basis of sex.The law was born out of observed discrimination toward women in academics and athletics. However, the law has been instrumental in combating forms of sexual misconduct, such as harassment, assault and rape, as these are all legally forms of sex discrimination.Know Your IX, a student-led organization that focuses on combating sexual violence at schools, is trying to increase understanding of how Title IX work by advocating for the rights of sexual assault survivors.Earlier this week, it released its State Policy Playbook for ending campus sexual assault. The manual takes a comprehensive look at the relationship between campus policies, state governance and the ways Title IX can protect assault survivors.According to the playbook, the best actions schools can take are to create clear and accessible definitions of consent and gender-based misconduct.Students must have ready information about the resources and accommodations offered to them by their universities. Colleges need to be responsible for letting students know of the different reporting and disciplinary options available to them, as well as who at their school is a mandatory reporter.Universities must also disseminate information about what their Title IX Coordination Office does and how students can contact them.Campuses need to be the best advocates for assault survivors and fight against gender-based discrimination like sexual violence. By not doing so, colleges fail to let female students thrive and miss the mission of fair education.IU Bloomington students who wish to report a sexual assault or harassment can do so by contacting the IU Police Department or Bloomington Police Department, the IU Office of Student Ethics or IU Title IX Coordination. On-campus counseling for survivors is available through the IU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS), as well as the University’s Confidential Victim Advocates program.

The IU Police Department operates on campus with a fleet of 13 vehicles and 40 full-time officers plus around 60 part-time officers and cadets.It’s also important to remember that you have many resources at IU that work together to keep you safe.We caught up with IUPD Chief Laury Flint to learn more about the department and how to keep yourself safe.Who should I contact first in the event that I feel unsafe?Please contact IUPD first and immediately if you feel unsafe for any reason.What options do I have to get a safe ride home on campus?Safety Escort (safety.indiana.edu) is a student-run transportation service for IU Bloomington students and staff as an alternative to walking alone at night. Safety Escort is funded through IU Parking Services, so there is no cost to ride.Hours are Sunday through Thursday from 8 p.m. to 1:45 a.m., and Friday/Saturday 8 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. Call 812- 855-SAFE (855-7233) for a ride. While summer classes are in session, hours are 8 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. seven days a week. The service stops taking calls before closing time if its call capacity is reached for the night.Last year the service went mobile by allowing Android and Apple device users to arrange for rides using the TapRide app. There are also several taxi services in Bloomington whose rates vary depending on the distance travelled.What are those blue lights I see spread across campus?The blue lights have a (red) button that can be pressed to immediately call 911 in the event of an emergency.The location of the blue light is automatically communicated to the police. Blue lights also have the capability of allowing a caller to dial a local number in a non-emergency situation.What is IUPD?IUPD is IU’s very own police department that operates all day, every day.What’s the difference between IUPD and BPD?IUPD’s primary area of jurisdiction is the IU campus, while Bloomington Police Department’s primary area of jurisdiction is the surrounding city.Do you have any suggestions for how I can stay safe on campus?If you see something that makes you feel uneasy or you consider to be unsafe, call 911 immediately. IUPD would rather respond and find that there is no problem than not receive a call.IUPD offers several safety programs and group presentations, including the Rape Aggression Defense course. See indiana.edu/~iupd/communityPrograms.html for more information. Students are also encouraged to talk to police officers anytime, not just when there is a problem.Part-time officers are full-time students at IU Bloomington who also completed the IU Police Academy to become fully sworn Indiana law enforcement officers. Many of them live in and/or work at the campus dormitories.Are there social media accounts to follow to stay on top of campus safety?It is important to keep contact information current for the university’s IU Notify emergency alert system. Students can do this by logging into one.iu.edu and conducting a search for IU Notify. IU Notify is used for two types of notices: emergency notifications warn students when they need to take immediate action to avoid danger, and crime alerts warn of ongoing threats or concerns of which students should be aware such as a sexual assault.Texts are the quickest way to receive the time-sensitive emergency notifications, so students should include their cell phone numbers with their IU Notify contact information.The Bloomington Police Department has a Facebook page (Bloomington Police Department) and Twitter account @BltgINPolice that students, especially those living off-campus, might find useful.Where is IUPD located and how can I contact the department?IUPD is located at 1469 E. 17th St., west of Jordan Avenue. Non-emergency calls can be placed to 812-855-4111. Call 911 in case of emergency.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The IU Police Department will begin its summer police academy next week, and current IU cadets take the next step in their careers in law enforcement.The academy first took place in 1972 and always happens on the Bloomington campus. This year’s class will have a total of 47 cadets, and 33 are from the Bloomington campus. Cadets from all eight IU campuses can participate in the academy training, which is part of what makes the program so well-rounded, said Capt. Greg Butler, commander of the academy who will be retiring this year after 22 years in his position.“That’s one thing about our program — it kind of reflects the University community,” Butler said.This year’s class will have a total of 14 female cadets out of 47, which is the most it has ever had. While usually a few cadets drop out from the program over the course of the summer, they expect at least 40 will graduate, Butler said.Training lasts 14 weeks for a total of 600 hours from May to August. For two of these weeks, cadets go off-site to Plainfield, Indiana, for additional training. Throughout the course of the program, cadets balance physical training with legal training, including education on calls regarding hazardous materials, sexual assault, domestic violence, individuals with disabilities, race relations and diversity training.Butler said the most stressful time during the academy is probably when cadets are expected to shoot a firearm.“Our standards are pretty strict,\" Butler said.Butler will retire on the first day of the academy after a 22-year run as commander. As a graduate from the very first academy class in 1972, Butler has seen the progression of the program over time and seen their reputation grow.“The program has a lot of respect throughout the state,” Butler said. “We’re actually the third-largest academy in the state.”After completing their training at IU, Butler said cadets have gone on to become police officers, judges and lawyers and work at the FBI, CIA, Drug Enforcement Administration and Secret Service. Seeing this progression and development is truly rewarding, Butler said.“The best thing for me is to see these kids develop,” Butler said. “To me, that’s the satisfaction that I see from this program.”Stephen Luce, IUPD sergeant-training coordinator, was also a graduate from the academy. Luce said the friendships he made throughout his training were some of his favorite memories.“It’s an intense 16 weeks,” Luce said. “But the best part was the camaraderie with your peers. You’re very close-knit.”This year will mark the 43rd graduating academy class from IUPD and Butler said he is optimistic for the future of the program.“It will hopefully continue to march for another 45 years, long after I’m gone,” Butler said.',\n",

However, I understand why people would have a problem with her.My problem with her lies in her obsession of calling it an attack on free speech. Free speech is a right granted to us by the First Amendment to protect us from oppressive government censorship.It does not mean that we can say whatever we want without consequences from society. Many pundits, conservative and liberal, seem to forget that the freedom of speech doesn’t mean everyone must listen.People are going to voice unpopular opinions. Honestly, the First Amendment is one of my favorites.I love that if I criticize my government, it can’t just put me in jail. That right should be protected because we are in a democratic society. Free speech is a necessity in a free society.However, just because the government can’t punish us for saying things doesn’t mean that society can let you get away with everything.When people spout hate speech on Twitter and then wonder why they get fired, it is not a violation of free speech. When a law fellow tweets about sexual assault in a disparaging manner, he should resign.I see free speech balls and celebrating the right to say whatever we want and that’s important. We should be able to express opinions, and honestly, there is nothing legally stopping us from engaging in political discourse.There is a lot we can say and do. Many late-night comics make a living from criticizing the president. The amount that we can freely criticize people, companies and our government is huge.That’s why I don’t think it’s a big deal that saying a derogatory phrase on public social media can get you fired, why people can boycott companies if they do not agree with their choices or why people are mad that Ann Coulter, who previously said things against liberals, immigrants and Muslims.Ann Coulter can say whatever she wants.

       "  'body': 'The community will have the opportunity to honor the life and work of former Middle Way House director Toby Strout at a Monday memorial.The Strout family and Middle Way House are presenting the Celebration of the Life of Toby Strout at 5:30 p.m. Monday at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater. Doors will open at 5 p.m., and no tickets are required.Strout, who served as the executive director of Middle Way House for 30 years before her retirement in 2016, died in February. During her time at the organization, she helped more than 60,000 survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault in the Bloomington area.The program will feature poetry and musical performances. Family members, friends and coworkers will share stories about Strout’s life.Anna Strout, Toby’s daughter, said the Bloomington community is still grieving after the death of her mother.“I think that, as well as grieving, we should celebrate the great woman who shaped a community of caring and action because that is the best way to honor her,” Anna said.Bob Arnove, who was married to Toby Strout for 29 years, said she would have wanted a memorial service that would both celebrate her life and advocate for the causes she believed in.Many people in the community want a sense of closure after Strout’s death and this event will allow them to share their grief and rejoice in her example, he said.“Many people really find it incredible to believe she is no longer present,” Arnove said. “She is present in the organization she built up to be a national model program for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.”Middle Way House executive director Debra Morrow said this celebration of life is important to the Middle Way House staff members who worked with Strout.“She wasn’t just our boss or our co-worker,” Morrow said. “She was our friend.”Morrow said Strout built the foundation of Middle Way House’s services for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, and the celebration will include information about the progression of Middle Way House under Strout’s leadership.Arnove said the songs at the celebration were selected for their personal and political importance to Strout. The performances will feature local musicians who were friends with Strout.Janiece Jaffe and Curtis Cantwell-Jackson will perform “Over the Rainbow,” which her family members sang to Strout in her final hours at the hospital, Arnove said.The event will also feature a number of songs related to social justice and labor activism.“We’re going to have these musicians perform songs that were important to her and have marked her work and messages that she wanted to convey,” Anna said.The celebration is also taking place on International Workers’ Day to honor her mother’s life of activism, she said.Attendees are also invited to gather at the courthouse square after the program to demonstrate support for legislation that supports Middle Way House, including the Violence Against Women Act.This is a way for members of the community to stand in unity in support of Middle Way House and Toby Strout’s legacy, Morrow said.“It’s all of us standing there symbolically, representing the things that she believed in,” she said.Anna said she wants the community to continue her mother’s work and keep her spirit alive.‘The work was never done,” she said. “I think she put everyone else before herself, and she influenced so many people from all backgrounds and all spectrums, and she really transformed the community.”',\n",

       "  'date': '4/26/2017',\n",
       "  'body': 'When the IU Faculty Athletics Committee approved a new sexual violence policy for IU Athletics on April 12, it brought national attention to the new way IU selects incoming student-athletes.The policy prevents any student-athlete found responsible for sexual violence at a previous college or high school from being eligible for financial aid or athletics at IU. This applies to incoming freshmen, transfer students, walk-ons or athletes of a different status.IU Athletics describes the policy as “unique among individual NCAA member schools,” although IU Athletic Director Fred Glass said he wasn’t trying to be a trailblazer when crafting the policy.“We did it because we thought it was important for the safety of the campus and for students in collegiate athletics to represent IU well,” Glass said. “We’re doing all we can do to attract IU collegiate athletes of whom everyone can be proud.”Recent high-profile incidents at Baylor University and Vanderbilt University drew attention to sexual and domestic violence in collegiate athletics.In particular, Glass said the incidents at Baylor were instructive in terms of knowing how to deal with sexual violence as an athletic director.“A big lesson from that is you have to deal with issues through a University-sanctioned construct,” Glass said. “We made it very clear to our coaches, staffs and student-athletes that these things wouldn’t be handled inside athletics. We have to get it outside of athletics.”The athletic coaching staffs at IU were only one type of perspective Glass sought in creating the policy. Glass also received outside input from IU’s Office of Student Welfare and Title IX and the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee to draft and implement the policy.Glass said the head coaches of IU’s sports teams were very supportive during the process.“In athletics, we have some experience with these issues, but it’s a broader problem,” Glass said. “It’s a problem on the IU campus and on campuses around the country.”IU has the ability to create an individual sexual violence policy in part because the Big Ten does not have a conference-wide policy.This differentiates the Big Ten from other NCAA athletic conferences like the Southeastern Conference, which in May 2015 passed a rule banning its schools from accepting transfers who were dismissed from their previous program due to “serious misconduct.”The conference defined “serious misconduct” as “sexual assault, domestic violence or other forms of sexual violence.”Glass said he would be in favor of a Big Ten ban similar to the SEC’s, although the Big Ten has concluded it should be an institution-by-institution decision.“Our policy goes beyond the SEC’s,” Glass said. “But the SEC deserves credit for starting the ball rolling.”The new IU policy includes an appellate process for those found in violation. According to the policy, “a panel consisting of the University Title IX Coordinator, University General Counsel, and University Faculty Athletics Representative” would conduct a “review of all pertinent facts available” before ruling on appeals.Glass said it was important the policy provides due process to the greatest extent possible for the accused.“Sometimes there can be extenuating circumstances, and we are prepared for that contingency,” Glass said. “The panel of people come from outside the athletic department, so if there are exceptions made, they’re being made because of the case, not athletics.”Glass said the policy is focused on incoming students at IU because a good process already exists for current student-athletes accused of sexual violence.“The University has a specific policy of sexual violence and misconduct, and we have our own student-athlete code of conduct,” Glass said. “The process is well set out and is positive and progressive for students with accusations while here.”With more than 700 student-athletes enrolled at IU, Glass said he knows issues will arise, and the policy serves as a way to prevent people with red flags from entering IU’s athletic programs.“We aren’t going to stick our head in the sand to avoid warning signs,” Glass said. “IU Athletics is committed to protecting all members of the IU community.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Justice Unlocked senior staff attorney Michael LoPrete said he wants people to feel like they have access to the justice system when dealing with issues of sexual assault.“I think it’s important to demystify the legal process,” he said. “I think there’s a real access-to-justice problem.”Justice Unlocked is a local nonprofit that offers legal aid on a sliding-scale basis for people who do not qualify for free legal services but cannot afford a standard attorney fee.The organization presented a seminar on legal matters related to sexual assault and domestic violence Monday to a small group at the Monroe County Public Library.LoPrete discussed issues like rape culture, definitions of sexual assault and sexual violence, protective orders, and resources for victims of sexual assault at the seminar.Deputy development director Lasserina Dowell said she wanted to have members of the community discuss the issue of sexual assault and to inform the public of available resources.“It just gets the conversation going, and really the purpose of it is just to educate the public on their rights and what resources there are,” she said.LoPrete said it is important to encourage people to talk about issues of sexual assault because it helps the victims feel more comfortable speaking up about their experience.“If we are afraid to talk about certain issues because they feel taboo, the people who are in that situation are going to feel that pressure too,” LoPrete said.LoPrete said rape culture is one factor that discourages people from discussing issues of sexual violence. Rape culture includes issues such as victim blaming, inappropriate comments or jokes about rape, , denial of widespread rape, and silence on issues of sexual assault.One of the topics LoPrete discussed was the definition of consent. He emphasized the need for a clear expression of agreement.“Consent is not merely the lack of a no,” he said. “It’s an enthusiastic, affirmative yes.”He also focused on the role of bystanders in the issue of sexual assault. He said it is essential for people to speak up.“If you are willing to no longer stay silent when you see things or witness things that are not okay, you are taking steps to fighting sexual violence in the community,” LoPrete said.Justice Unlocked executive director Jamie Sutton said one of the main issues victims of sexual assault face is trying to get people to believe them. It is important not to brush away these incidents, he said.LoPrete said it is easy to feel intimidated by the legal system but he wants to encourage outreach that allows people to ask questions.When people deal with the legal system after a sexual assault, they often do not know where to turn, Dowell said.“You just don’t know what the steps are, and of course you can Google things, but that doesn’t always help your case as much as you would like to think,” she said.Dowell said Justice Unlocked’s goal is to break down complicated legal matters for people and walk them through the process.“It’s kind of like a partnership,” she said. “The whole goal is that they don’t have to go through this process alone.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Current and former IU Student Association executives and staff traveled to Washington, D.C., this week for the Association of Big Ten Students’ Big Ten on the Hill conference.The annual event brings together student leaders from all 14 schools in the Big Ten Conference. Outgoing IUSA president senior Sara Zaheer; her two vice presidents; seniors Alex Trevino and Tyler Knox; and treasurer junior Patrick Kennedy were present on the trip.They were accompanied by their co-chiefs of state and legislative affairs, sophomores Molly Connor and Alex Wisniewski. Connor is the incoming IUSA vice president of administration.“We’re really excited for IU’s office that just opened in D.C.,” Zaheer said, referencing the recently established Office of Federal Relations. which the group will be visiting while they’re at the conference.One of the topics discussed recently in national conversation was legislation that would require sexual assault charges at a university level to be recorded on any transfer records, Wisniewski said. This means if an offender switched schools, their transcript would have a misconduct mark comparable to if the student had been caught with plagiarism.Wisniewski said this is not something that is pushed as a student government but more so an idea that has been discussed on a national level. He said many concerns that arise from the concept involve due process but on the other hand some students have had multiple misconduct charges leveled against them.The representatives from IU also visited with staff at the Department of Education and the House Education and Workforce Subcommittee. Part of the meeting with the Department of Education was in question-and-answer format, and Zaheer said many of the questions posed pertained to mental health.Zaheer said she wanted to know how the new department, under Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, would put into effect plans for new and innovative education given DeVos’s position on alternative forms of learning. Zaheer said college completion rates play a large role in determining school ratings and school funding.“I specifically asked if the department had any plans to address the mental wellness piece,” said Zaheer, explaining that mental health was key in ensuring students graduate in a timely manner.IUSA’s delegation in Washington also discussed ways to promote political involvement among the student body. ABTS’s recent “VoteB1G” initiative encouraged students at Big Ten universities to register to vote. On Monday the representatives met with Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana.“We actually just met with Senator Young, and some of the feedback we’re getting is kind of bringing civic engagement back on campus,” Wisniewski said Monday.Wisniewski said part of what he’s learned in his experience and from the conference was that civic engagement begins with old-fashioned tactics like writing to candidates and calling their offices with concerns. Wisniewski said politicians may not read every single letter they receive from their constituents, but it sends a message.A central theme in student engagement with their elected officials is making sure their concerns are expressed properly.“If there’s an issue we care about, we want to make sure we’re taking it to the right people,” Zaheer said.',\n",

This show will prove dangerously consequential in forming more distorted opinions about mental health.The show, based on the 2007 fiction novel by Jay Asher of same name, tells the story of Hannah Baker, a girl who commits suicide and leaves behind 13 audiotapes for her friends to hear which explain the horrendous bullying and sexual assault she endured that drove her to suicide.There’s no questioning that Baker’s experiences are valid and horrific. However, the show’s romanticizing of suicide as a revenge fantasy to achieve martyrdom is an extremely inaccurate depiction of why people are driven to suicide and dangerously inaccurate for young audiences to see.Mental health experts unanimously agree that this portrayal of suicide is highly inaccurate and very dangerous for young teenagers to watch.Countless studies tracking journalistic coverage and media response to suicide and the effects of mental health conclude a number of universal principles those in the media should follow when communicating suicide deaths.Among these rules, it’s understood that people shouldn’t sensationalize the suicide, discuss the suicide note contents, speculate about why the suicide occurred or glamorize the suicide.“13 Reasons Why” managed to turn all of the professional do-nots into a soap opera for all teenagers to see.Considering that suicide has risen to rank as the second-leading cause of death among American teenagers, it would have been wise for Asher and the show’s executive producers and show-runners to heed expert opinion and forsake dramatic television.The show has received praise for its ability to provide solidarity for those who’ve previously experienced bullying or suicidal thoughts. Of course, it’s important for everyone to know that they are not alone, especially those who often don’t see their stories on screen.The show’s perversion of solidarity, however, depicts suicide as a way to sainthood and relinquishes all personal autonomy. Baker individually blames her friends and bullies in each tape and places the onus on them to fix her most deeply rooted issues.Most importantly, the show misrepresents those who are driven to suicide. According to the Canadian Mental Health Association, depression and suicide are highly correlated. While the bullying depicted in “13 Reasons Why” is extreme, the reality is most suicidal individuals will have already had a history of depression.This show does not account for this. Rather, it only presents a slew of misinformation around mental health.The media should be able to show survivors of suicide attempts, extreme bullying and mental illness that their stories indeed matter without distorting the reality of suicide into a revenge plot.“13 Reasons Why” is dangerous exploitation and harmful to our collective understanding of suicide and mental illness.jsbourkl@umail.iu.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'If you can run fast enough or throw a ball far enough, you probably won’t suffer many consequences for sexually assaulting someone if you’re punished at all.In the current climate, it is standard practice for universities to say on paper that they value the well-being of all their students and then show in practice that they actually value most the students who can make them the most money.Colleges like Baylor University, Pennsylvania State University and Florida State University have come under fire in recent history for trying to cover up incidents of sexual violence in athletics.Thankfully, IU is now taking a stronger official stance against the immoral hypocrisy of such practices.Approved by the IU-Bloomington Faculty Athletics Committee on April 12, a new policy will make prospective student athletes with histories of sexual violence ineligible for practice, competition or sports-related financial aid at IU. Though this is a blanket policy, an appeals process exists that will allow a student athlete to go before a board of administrators to hear their case.IU Athletics Director Fred Glass composed the policy in collaboration with the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee and the Office of Student Welfare and Title IX.Under this new policy, IU’s athletic programs will bar participation to “any prospective student-athlete — whether a transfer student, incoming freshman or other status — who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty or no contest to a felony involving sexual violence.”Sexual violence refers to “dating violence, domestic violence, rape, sexual assault or sexual violence as defined by the Indiana University Policy on Sexual Misconduct.”It is disappointing to realize that the University is only just now making this kind of stand in its formal policy, but the Editorial Board commends IU for being the first school in the Big Ten to do so. The Big Ten’s current policy leaves each school to set its own rules on this issue.“My hope is that we’re leading in this area, and maybe others will follow with, maybe not the exact same policy, but one that fits their particular institutions,” Glass told the Indianapolis Star.Of the many heinous ways that institutions of all kinds prioritize profit over ethical decision-making, the tendency of universities to shield student athletes from the consequences of committing acts of sexual violence is particularly problematic.No reasonable person would say that the better you can dribble a basketball, the more you can violate another individual without facing retribution.It is necessary that we demonstrate in both words and actions that we do not value some students’ athletic abilities over other students’ basic rights of safety and wellbeing.Policies such as IU’s are crucial parts of the necessary fight to dismantle rape culture on college campuses, and we are proud of our university for working to establish itself as a leader in that fight.We say that we are one IU — that we live in a culture of care and that it’s on us to stop sexual violence. Thanks to recent administrative efforts, these words now carry more weight.',\n",

       "  'body': 'With the approval of a policy preventing prospective student-athletes with a sexual violence record from being eligible, IU Athletics is following a trend among collegiate athletic programs.The policy was approved April 12 by the IU Faculty Athletics Committee. It bars any prospective student-athlete found responsible for sexual violence while at a previous college or high school from receiving financial aid or competing at IU.Incoming freshmen, transfer students or athletes of a different status are all included under the policy.Many Indiana high schools, like Evansville North, have their athletes sign a code of conduct holding them accountable for their actions on and off the field. Evansville North Athletic Director Andrew Huff said the code of conduct is a way to ensure students represent the school in the right way, and IU has done the same with its policy.“I think it’s something that every university has issues with and needs to be addressed,” Huff said. “It’s not just about how well you can play on the basketball court or on the football field.”This issue of sexual violence in collegiate athletics has come to the forefront recently. A pending lawsuit against Baylor University alleges 31 football players committed acts of sexual violence from 2011 to 2014.In September 2016 former IU football player Kiante Enis was dismissed from the team after his arrest on two counts of child molestation.Based on the current climate, New Castle High School Athletic Director Shane Osting said he wouldn’t be surprised to see other universities or high schools adopt similar policies.“It sets a standard for the athletic programs as far as the type of students they want to have as recruits,” Osting said. “It sets the University to a higher standard for those athletes.”In May 2015, the Southeastern Conference singled out transfer athletes by passing a rule banning its schools from accepting transfers dismissed from their previous program due to “serious misconduct.” “Serious misconduct” was defined as “sexual assault, domestic violence or other forms of sexual violence” by the conference.For comparison, the Big Ten has no conference-wide rule about what student-athletes its schools can accept, which leaves the decisions to the schools themselves.Valparaiso High School Athletic Director Herb Hofer said it’s common to see differences in policies at both the high school and collegiate levels.“If you want to go to IU, you have to play by their rules,” Hofer said. “Athletes are held to a higher standard because athletics are a privilege and not a right.”Valparaiso High School is another school that has its athletes agree to a student-athlete code of conduct.Hofer said the code of conduct can change on a yearly basis, and both coaches and a student advisory board are consulted as to what changes need to be made.“We’re trying to work with our athletes to make teachable moments become learning moments,” Hofer said. “We talk with them all the time that their behavior has ramifications down the road.”The idea for the policy came from IU Athletic Director Fred Glass, who also introduced a Student-Athlete Bill of Rights in 2014 that details the commitment IU makes to its student-athletes. Glass could not be reached for comment by press time.“He’s preventing things from happening on his campus,” Huff said. “It’s like he’s being an innovator and being ahead of what’s going on.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"To our friends, allies, and supporters,Those of you who participated in our recent email campaign probably received a response from Provost Robel — a response that attempted to disparage and demonize our organization. While we will address some of Provost Robel’s points, let it be clear that we are doing so only to reveal the IU administration's main tactic against us: an attempt to distract us, our supporters, and our potential supporters, from Indiana University’s complicity in perpetuating systemic racism and inequality.On April 5th, Students Against State Violence, along with around 50 of our allies and supporters, delivered a letter to Provost Robel demanding that the IU administration put more effort and resources behind implementing the Bloomington Faculty Council (BFC) Resolution on Diversity — which had already been passed a year ago to that date. The administration, in cooperation with some of the more conservative members of the BFC, has been actively working to stall or undermine the resolution, which called for an exploration into a social justice education requirement and more active recruitment, aid, and retention of underrepresented students, faculty, and staff of color.Tellingly, Provost Robel did not respond to our demand letter, choosing instead to send a generic response to those who wrote to her as part of our email campaign. In her emailed response, she attacks SASV directly, attempting to minimize the university-wide struggle for social justice by framing it as a personal squabble between SASV and the provost’s office. To be clear: we have no interest in targeting Provost Robel; rather, we aim to hold the entirety of IU’s administration accountable to the broader IU community. Furthermore, SASV is not one static group of people; rather, it is a dynamic and responsive platform through which students, faculty, staff, and other organizations unite behind common goals and principles.That said, Robel’s criticisms of SASV — or, more accurately, against what she imagines SASV to be — are still inaccurate and worthy of clarification. How can SASV be, as Robel claims, “hands down the most overtly violent group on campus” when IU fraternities frequently make headlines for sexual assaults, hazing, and other acts of violence perpetrated by their members — and when we know that the assaults reported are but a fraction of those that actually occur? How can we be the most violent group on campus when IUPD, the very organization charged with protecting students, uses our campus as a training ground for broken windows policing, is complicit in brutalizing student protesters, and cultivates an environment in which cadets and officers find it acceptable to sexually assault students?Even these rebuttals, however, remain confined within Robel’s narrow and skewed perception of what “violence” really is. Through scapegoating SASV as the most “violent group on campus”, Robel obscures the racism, misogyny, ableism, and all other forms of systematic violence which occur daily at IU. If throwing a canvas banner over an inanimate object is violence, but the administration providing a platform for a person who thinks that women and people of color are genetically inferior isn’t —If chalking a wall is violence, but deliberately resisting the implementation of social justice education isn’t —If interrupting a speech is violence, but deploying over 70 armed guards in an attempt to silence student dissent isn’t —If holding our university accountable is violence, but the administration’s failure to hold fraternities accountable for perpetuating rape culture isn't —If speaking out boldly against all forms of injustice is violent —Then yes, we are proud to be the most “violent” group on campus.In her attempts to divert attention from the actual issues — namely, the well-being of students of color, the ethics violations of lending Murray’s research a sheen of legitimacy, and the administration’s hypocritical willingness to suppress student dissent with militarized force — Robel went so far as to completely fabricate information to scapegoat SASV, claiming that “pre-talk threats” from SASV were the reason for militarized police presence at the Murray speech. Contrary to Robel’s assertion, SASV made absolutely no comments about Murray’s invitation until after the Media School sent an email about the “security measures” that were to be taken.In her email response, Provost Robel condemned protesters for what she described as “assaults” on a vehicle, yet contradicts herself in her IDS op-ed the same night by stating that we were “peaceful protesters.” This is just another example of Provost Robel skewing her story to fit whatever narrative is most useful to her. In this case, the narrative is an attempt to convince our supporters that SASV is a fringe group of violent extremists, but to assure the public that we are a peaceful and subdued non-threat.Note that Provost Robel published her statement about the Murray visit and “peaceful protesters” as an op-ed in the student paper, not as an official university statement. With deafening silence, Robel and the IU administration have failed to address the documented police brutality against students at the anti-Murray rally, and the fact that a student was detained by police for no apparent reason — acts facilitated by the university administration when they ordered the militarization of our campus. In fact, as of this writing the university has still made no official statement whatsoever about the Murray speech or the protests.Having addressed Provost Robel’s attempts to disparage our organization, we would like to speak to the progress we’ve made and the future of our movement. The material impact of SASV and our allies' work for justice at IU extends beyond the one-off demonstrations Robel denounced in her message. For instance, the aforementioned detained student was released only through the solidarity of protesters who vehemently demanded her release and refused to leave without her. The faculty council committee charged with addressing the resolution's call for a social justice general education requirement was created only after our demands for implementation last semester. Our outreach efforts and educational events have raised awareness of social-justice issues on campus, and we have succeeded in building a strong coalition of organizations and individuals across IU’s campuses, all working towards a more just and accessible university. Having achieved this and more in just a few short semesters, it is exhilarating to imagine what we can accomplish with a mass movement of IU community members. Ultimately, our demands for the implementation of the BFC resolution are only an incremental step towards our goal of a tuition-free, anti-imperialist, un-policed, fully accessible and sustainable institution where diversity, safety, and inclusion are the standard, and not something to be fought for.\",\n",

John Kovach said. She described her alleged assailant to police as a 6-foot-tall, 240-pound black man with tattoos on his forearm and said though she did not know him she knew other people who did.The two had met at Monroe County Public Library earlier in the day, she told police. They left together and walked down the B-Line trail. Behind some nearby storage units, he forced her to perform oral sex.After that, they went to the Wendy’s at Second Street and College Avenue, she said. There, he took her into the men’s restroom and raped her.They left Wendy’s and walked back downtown, where she fled and called police. She said he had told her he was a gang member and that people who crossed him would be “dealt with,” and she was afraid to try to leave.Police interviewed people whom the woman said would know the suspect and eventually located him downtown. The 50-year-old transient man admitted to having sex with her but said it was consensual.Police are continuing to investigate the case and will try to obtain security footage from the businesses in the areas of the alleged assaults, Kovach said.',\n",

Indiana University Athletics shall conduct an appropriate inquiry into every prospective student-athlete’s background consistent with the due diligence below prior to providing him/her athletically-related aid or allowing him/her to practice or compete.For purposes of this provision, “sexual violence” is dating violence, domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, or sexual violence as defined by the Indiana University Policy on Sexual Misconduct (UA-03).Indiana University Athletics requires due diligence efforts to gather pertinent information regarding the prior conduct of every prospective student-athlete who seeks to enroll and participate in intercollegiate athletics. Pursuant to the Department’s October 22, 2015, Student Conduct Policy, a criminal background check and internet search must be performed on every prospective student-athlete. Accessing as much as possible publicly available information regarding prospective student-athletes, including their digital footprint, is strongly recommended. Coaches should also talk to teachers, coaches, administrators, teammates and family members of prospective student-athletes. In addition, prospective student-athletes should be specifically asked about any previous or potential arrests, convictions, protective orders, probations, suspensions, expulsions, or other discipline involving sexual violence or any other matter.Any issue as to if or how this policy applies to a particular prospective student-athlete will be resolved by the Office of General Counsel.In addition to the mandatory disqualification of prospective student-athletes with records of sexual violence as set forth in this policy, prospective student-athletes may and should be disqualified for other demonstrated unacceptable misconduct. Specifically, consistent with the Student Conduct Policy, IU Athletics will carefully consider whether to recruit any prospective student-athletes with any serious and/or repetitive criminal, school discipline, or other misconduct issues. Also consistent with that policy, the sport administrator for the pertinent sport must approve the recruitment of any prospective student-athlete with any serious and/or repetitive criminal, school discipline, or other misconduct issues.Relief from this mandatory disqualification policy may only be granted by a panel consisting of the University Title IX Coordinator, University General Counsel, and University Faculty Athletics Representative after a review by it of all the pertinent facts available and a finding of compelling exceptional circumstances.Approved by the Indiana University Bloomington Faculty Athletics Committee on April 12, 2017.',\n",

       "  'body': 'HBO released “Confirmation” one year ago Sunday. The show is the political biopic and thriller based on Anita Hill’s testimony against Clarence Thomas before the Senate Judiciary Committee in late 1991.Between now and the TV film’s release, a man with a questionable history of sexual assault and perverse attitudes toward women and sex was elected to the presidency.Although Hill’s testimony captivated millions of Americans and sparked political ambition in women across the country to change responses to sexual harassment, the pain of her hearing still rings true.Upon former Supreme Court Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall’s retirement, then-federal Circuit Judge Clarence Thomas was next in line for the high court.Thomas was Hill’s supervisor at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the place in charge of logging sexual harassment claims, ironically enough. During Thomas’ confirmation, Hill testified against him before the Senate Judiciary Committee by recounting the incessant and grotesque sexual harassment she endured by her supervisor.The committee didn’t attempt to take Hill seriously.The former high school valedictorian, Oklahoma State University honors graduate and Yale Law School graduate was branded as careless, misguided and asking for it. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by a young Joe Biden, were condemning at worst and apathetic at best.Upon the release of “Confirmation,” Hill spoke with Rolling Stone magazine in an April 2016 recounting her experiences before the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee.“I like to remind people that I was subpoenaed to testify, and when I answered the subpoena and I made myself available, I was treated horribly by the process,” Hill said in the interview. “I think that should be the lesson, if the issue is sexual harassment or any number of issues that can be brought to your government and representatives. Citizens should have the right and should be able to exercise their obligation to provide information to processes, and they should be treated with respect and decency.”The televised event was a rude awakening for American women on the insurmountable obstacles to have sexual harassment obligations taken seriously without judgment.At the time of Hill’s testimony, public opinion polls indicated a wide majority of Americans sided with Thomas.Years of Hill recounting her story, political commentary and Republican operatives such as David Brock apologizing for misinforming the public about the situation finally led to the general public seeing the bigger picture.“It would have been more comfortable to remain silent,” she said during her testimony. “But when I was asked by a representative of this committee to report my experience, I felt that I had to tell the truth. I could not keep silent.”Hill’s brave testimony and commentary since the event have given women in the workplace a fighting chance against institutional harassment and indifferent bystanders.There are many lessons to learn from her story — if only we would heed them.jsbourkl@umail.iu.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'After marching down Kirkwood Avenue in protest of sexual assault, women and men sat closely to share their own experiences with self-doubt and self-hate after being sexually harassed, groped or raped.One woman told the confidants her experience with isolation and shame after breaking up with an abusive boyfriend.Another spoke about her struggle coming to terms with being raped by her boyfriend.Some women wore T-shirts and jeans, and others their bras and shorts as they gathered in Dunn Meadow. One woman, unabashed, wore nothing but jeans and silver star stickers over each breast. The women, along with some men, marched down Kirkwood to the Monroe County Courthouse to participate in IU’s annual Slut Walk.“Whatever we wear, wherever we go, yes means yes and no means no,” the marchers chanted.A Slut Walk is a national movement which calls for an end to rape culture and sexual harassment by engaging in peaceful protest. IU’s annual Slut Walk is organized by the Feminist Student Association to raise awareness of sexual assault and victim blaming.Sophomore Lucy Battersby, FSA’s director of communications, said the goal of the march is to provide marginalized and underrepresented people with an environment where they feel comfortable openly discussing issues relating to sexual assault regardless of their gender, race, socioeconomic status or sexual orientation.Battersby said the organization has three main reasons for coordinating the event each year.“We want to build solidarity, spark critical conversation, and provide a safe community platform for individuals and groups who have been marginalized,” she said.Before the march down Kirkwood, the female advocates gathered and amicably discussed the intersectionality of sexuality, feminism and diversity.Organizations such as All-Options Pregnancy Resource Center, Bloomington PRIDE, Planned Parenthood, Omega Phi Beta and the National Organization for Women had tables with information and resources for sexual assault survivors.The crowd came together and sat on the grass, while members from some of these organizations took the stage. They spoke to the crowd about how their organizations help sexual assault survivors and their experiences dealing with sexual assault.Janae Cummings, the board chair of Bloomington PRIDE, said although her parents believed she was just as capable as any man growing up, she didn’t think of herself as a feminist.“There’s so much I don’t know and so much I need to learn,” she said. “When I was growing up, being a feminist was a bad thing. It was a bad word. Feminists were loud and angry and stubborn and definitely ugly and probably lesbian.”Cummings emphasized the importance of being an inclusive feminist. She said feminism is not just about being a strong woman, but also about building other women, including women of color and queer women, up.“It’s not feminism if you’ve left the rest of us behind,” Cummings said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'You’re sitting on your couch. Spending the night on social media and not doing your homework. You get a notification from Facebook that so-and-so is going Live. We all hate these notifications.There’s a dark side to Facebook Live, though.The most recent troubles of Facebook Live involves victims who are being sexually assaulted on Facebook Live, so that everyone in the friend’s list of the assaulter can see what is happening, such as the recent case in Chicago, which was watched live by about 40 viewers according to Fox News.This is terrible.Sexual assault and the repercussions socially and mentally are already hard enough to deal with for victims. Add to that a list of people who have probably witnessed your sexual assault and will more than likely always remember what they saw.I am beginning to understand the fear of technology. I’ve written a few articles now on technology in opposition or in cooperation with the law. The only positive that can come out of the Facebook Live situation is that law enforcement may easily identify who assaulted the victim because of video proof. Also the list of witnesses is long.However, it seems to me that we shouldn’t be fearing technology in the hands of the government as much as we should be fearing it in each other’s hands.A spokeswoman for Facebook has responded to the situation, according to BBC News. She said that those who work for Facebook work hard to protect the users and will remove any videos that glorify sexual assault or violence.For me, this feels like a new level of threatening to post your ex’s nudes online. That level of shame and embarrassment is just a shadow compared to what these victims are dealing with now.Cyberbullying, unsolicited sexts and threats of posting pornographic pictures have always been a threat.In another case related to Facebook Live, a man in Chicago was bound, physically assaulted and slandered in a video that went live on the assailant’s Facebook.This particular event is being classified as a hate crime done against a Trump supporter. BBC News reports that the police who responded to the incident claim that the victim may have been held unwillingly for 48 hours before the assault.Because of Facebook Live, the police were able to identify the assailants and the victim. It is also said that the victim was 18 years old and facing mental health challenges.In this case, simply differing political views led to a heinous, violent crime against someone who was more than likely unable to defend himself. And then it was broadcast live so the friends of the assailants could either watch in horror or in delight. I hope it was the former.While Facebook removed this particular video, people had downloaded it beforehand and uploaded it to YouTube. It’s crazy to me that it was able to last 30 minutes and Facebook did not notice the content being broadcast nor did anyone report it.In 2016, Facebook made a statement about what standards it held for the live streams once they became popular. It claims that someone is waiting to respond to inappropriate content at all times.I understand that a live stream could be very vital in situations where people need help such as a kidnapping or a community crisis. However, it is scary  that people are using a tool like this to shame and humiliate innocent people.',\n",

       "  'body': 'New IU Coach Archie Miller’s résumé showed he could win. It showed Miller could inspire his players, become the face of Indiana basketball and lead the program toward its sixth national championship banner.But there was one variable Fred Glass considered that received less fanfare. Miller could handle significant legal situations involving his student-athletes.Two separate players, one in 2012 and the other in 2015, were investigated for allegedly committing sexual assaults while Miller coached at the University of Dayton. With the help of a search firm based in Atlanta, Glass decided Miller handled both cases appropriately.“Nobody can guarantee that a young person on their team is not going to get in trouble,” Glass told the Indiana Daily Student. “All they can do is guarantee that they’ll handle those situations appropriately.”University of Dayton took the lead. The allegations weren’t hidden within the team. They weren’t hidden within the athletic department.This wasn’t Baylor University, where the law firm Pepper Hamilton found numerous instances of institutional failure in regards to how Baylor University handled sexual assault cases, leading to the university’s president demotion and later resignation, in addition to the athletic director’s resignation and the football coach’s firing. This wasn’t Penn State University, where the mishandling of child sex abuse cases saw the football coach fired and the university’s president and athletic director both depart.Glass wouldn’t consider a candidate’s coaching abilities if the coach couldn’t prove he cared about honoring the sensitivity of sexual assault investigations.“I wanted to hear ... from his lips to my ears that he understood the importance of those being handled by the institution through the Title IX process as opposed to within the athletic department or the basketball program,” Glass said.Neither case during Miller’s tenure resulted in criminal charges against the then-Dayton Flyers players, but both Matt Kavanaugh and Dyshawn Pierre received suspensions because they violated University of Dayton’s code of conduct.Kavanaugh was suspended in October 2012 for the remainder of the 2012-13 academic year. He returned for the 2013-14 season. Pierre was suspended for the fall 2015 semester before returning to the team in late December of the same year.Peter Ginsberg, a New York City attorney, represented Pierre when he sued University of Dayton to have his suspension reversed.Ginsberg said he couldn’t speak to Pierre’s communications with Miller but knows Miller did what he could.“Archie understood his responsibilities to the university and 100 percent abided by those responsibilities and at the same time acted in a very humane, caring way toward Dyshawn,” Ginsberg said. “That’s consistent with the reputation Archie has, and it’s consistent with the experience I had with him.”After a federal judge decided against a motion Pierre made during the legal battle, Ginsberg said Pierre decided to serve out the remainder of his suspension.Glass said he discussed the two cases with Miller when the two met to discuss the IU job, and after addressing them, Glass didn’t have any concerns moving forward.Any coach Glass said he would consider had to have a track record of caring about the wellness of all students, not just his players, and a commitment to academics. They also had to be absolutely willing to follow the rules, especially regarding Title IX.Glass said he spoke to about two dozen former IU players, Indiana high school coaches, Indiana AAU coaches and knowledgeable basketball people from around the state and nation to gauge interest and gather advice. They all had their own views, but Glass said the vast majority told him to find someone who could come in and “win, win the right way and bring the family back together again.”Glass indicated his three-part threshold helped cull the list.“We did disqualify candidates from consideration because they didn’t meet one or more of those issues — following the rules, being committed to the wellness of students, and being committed to the academic success of students,” Glass said.Although he declined to comment on any specific individual candidate, of those rumored to be in consideration for the job was UCLA coach and former Hoosier basketball player Steve Alford. Alford’s journey as a college coach to UCLA included a head coaching stop at Iowa from 1999 to 2007.In 2002, one of his student athletes, Pierre Pierce, was charged with sexual assault and later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of assault causing injury. Alford publicly declared Pierce innocent numerous times. A report released in 2003 by a University of Iowa committee that investigated how the school handled the case criticized Alford’s actions.According to the report, Alford’s statements “implied that he disbelieved and discredited the claims of the student victim, and his words were perceived as reflecting insensitivity to issues of sexual assault and sexual violence.”Anne Lahey, a prosecutor assigned to the 2002 Pierce case, said she understood how a coach would have certain loyalties to a player.“But his seemed to be beyond that,” Lahey said.Pierce remained on the team until 2005, although the aforementioned case caused him to miss the 2002-03 season, before Alford dismissed him from the team after another arrest. Pierce plead guilty to third-degree burglary, false imprisonment, fourth-degree criminal mischief and assault with intent to commit sexual abuse.Alford apologized for his handling of the 2002 case through a statement in 2013 in his introductory press conference as the head coach at UCLA. He said he handled the case as he was told to, but in a later statement he said he would have handled it differently.Glass declined to confirm whether Alford was a candidate or not but acknowledged timing dictated to some degree who he could and couldn’t interview.“This wouldn’t be limited to Steve Alford, but there were people who could potentially have been candidates who were still playing in the tournament, and those people in my view wouldn’t have been available for me to interview,” Glass said.Glass said it’s an absolute must for a coach to have a proven track record of following any and all obligations in sexual assault cases, especially with regard to Title IX. The same goes for the wellness of students.“That’s another one where we look and see, are there any compliance issues where the person fell short and could be a predictor of future challenges?” Glass said.In a statement provided to the IDS, Miller said his team followed the university’s rules.“In cases of discipline at the University of Dayton, our program followed the proper protocol the University had established regarding student conduct,” Miller said.Glass doesn’t think Miller will have any trouble holding his players accountable.“I think Archie has demonstrated that he’ll handle those appropriately and has committed to being able to handle those appropriately,” he said. “I have a high degree of confidence in that regard.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Why are feminists and others okay that laws don’t criminalize violent porn?I don’t like the idea of the viewer having access to these, but also, I am waiting for people to step up for those “actors” in these films. Sure, maybe a few are consenting sometimes, but honestly, there is so much out there, and so many sketchy situations and money involved that it’s not even worth it to try and verify consent. It might as well all be actual rape and assault, happening to actual women. Thanks!As it turns out, people, including feminists, have a wide range of reactions to porn and different kinds of porn. Ideas about sex and porn are complicated. As you pointed out, the sex in porn is real. Some porn is described as “ethical porn” and is supposed to be guided by principles of ethical practices on and off set. Other porn is described as feminist porn and is supposed to be guided by feminist principles, both in how the porn is made and how the porn is shown. It’s unclear how often each kind achieves its goals as at least some research shows that even some feminist porn ultimately shows sex in pretty similar ways to mainstream porn.Others point out that there’s a sizable difference between porn and Hollywood, as Hollywood movies often involve stunts and the actors not really getting hurt. In porn, people are actually having sex, as you pointed out, and sometimes there are indeed some difficult and scary situations that happen on-set. Increasingly, a number of porn actors and actresses have shared stories about being sexually or physically assaulted on-set, or being asked to engage in sex acts that were not originally part of their contract. These contract and employment issues are serious ones that the industry continues to grapple with. And of course they are not the full story, as some porn actors and actresses describe a professional workplace, work that they find fulfilling and that supports them and their families, and they take seriously the right to experience their bodies and lives the way that they want to.To learn more about these varying perspectives on porn, sex, rights, and feminism, check out books like Girls & Sex by Peggy Orenstein, Coming Out Like a Porn Star by Jiz Lee, Pornland by Gail Dines, as well as the film Hot Girls Wanted, which is available on Netflix.Kinsey Confidential is a collaboration of the Kinsey Institute and the IU School of Public Health.

       "  'body': 'The Muslim Student Association is in the midst of its Islam Awareness Week. They have organized one event each day to promote cultural understanding of their religion, whether that’s answering a question and receiving a root beer float or having several women discuss their experiences with Islam.Tuesday evening, several Muslim women said Islam was a source of hope for them at the Muslima Monologues event.This is the third event organized by MSA for Islam Awareness Week. The presenters at this event discussed their personal challenges, including sexual assault and violence, societal judgment, and the meaning of the hijab, through storytelling and poetry-type discussion.Monday was national Muslim Women’s Day and the first day of Islam Awareness Week at IU. Board member and public relations chair for the Muslim Student Association sophomore Luma Khabbaz said the organization didn’t intend for Muslim Women’s Day and the Muslima Monologues to overlap.“It’s very fitting,” Khabbaz said. “We did not actually plan that, but it worked out really well.”This event focused on the feeling of oppression that some Muslim women feel and the obstacles they have faced over their lifetimes. It featured several different presenters, including IU students like Khabbaz and Muslim women within the Bloomington community and gave them the chance to share their stories.Khabbaz said she was looking forward to the monologues the most out of all the events during the awareness week.“Another reason is because this is an issue that’s very near and dear to my heart,” Khabbaz said. “I just think it’s really important to give women, especially women of color and Muslim women specifically, a platform to perform.”Attendees were welcomed to the Swain West lecture hall while songs like “I Will Survive” by Gloria Gaynor and “Superwoman” by Alicia Keys played in the background. Attendees of the event munched on cookies and ice cream and snapped their fingers when something resonated with them.Sophomore Arsalan Siddiqui, a board member and secretary for MSA, said he expected this event to be both culturally interesting and educational as well.“I felt like this would be a good informative event for people to understand about how important women are in Islam,” Siddiqui said. “Islam Awareness Week is the biggest event of the year for MSA. Siddiqui said this takes at least a month and a half to plan. Running from the 27th to the 31st, this celebration incorporates a variety of different events to celebrate the culture and diversities within the local Islam community.Khabbaz said the MSA tries to highlight how Islam is just one part of a Muslim person’s identity and works to eliminate misconceptions people might have about the religion and the accompanying culture.“Awareness is one thing, but the way we try to do awareness is through events that aren’t just like, ‘Oh, we’re Muslim. This is what we do,” Khabbaz said. “For example, this is an event for Muslim women. We have an event tomorrow that’s an interfaith event, so it’s like the idea that Muslims are not monolithic.”Additional events the MSA will have this week include an interfaith game night and a banquet.The organization will conclude the week with a Jummah prayer service at the Collins courtyard. Of these, Siddiqui said he’s most excited for Thursday night’s festivities, which will feature cuisine from Taste of India, Anatolia, Samira’s and Turkuaz, according to the organization’s Facebook page.“My personal favorite would be the Taste of Islam banquet since, like, one it involves food and two you get to learn about different cultures that make up the Islamic community here in Bloomington,” Siddiqui said.',\n",

Police first came in contact with Passwaiter on March 20, the same day they received the initial report of the assault, Bloomington Police Department Capt. Steve Kellams said.That day, a 15-year-old girl reported that one night during her spring break, she’d been sleeping over at a friend’s house, where Passwaiter was present. During the night, she woke up with Passwaiter’s hands down her pants.The same day, Passwaiter showed up at BPD headquarters and asked to speak to officers. Kellams said he did not know how Passwaiter heard about the complaint.Passwaiter told police he suffers from sexsomnia. That term can describe a wide range of sexual behaviors people compulsively perform while asleep, according to a 2009 report in Psychology Today. Passwaiter said the disorder causes him to perform sexual acts on people sleeping next to him, as the victim was.However, Passwaiter could offer no support for his diagnosis, Kellams said. He told police he’d been diagnosed by a now-deceased psychologist whose name he would not give.Later in the week, police interviewed the victim and a witness, who corroborated her statements. Both said Passwaiter was awake when the victim woke.Police arrested Passwaiter at about 2 p.m. Monday. He continued to deny memory of the event and again cited sexsomnia.Jack Evans',\n",

       "  'body': 'On Wednesday and Thursday students can choose to vote for IGNITE, Empower IU, Engage with IU, Focus or Psych Up in the IU Student Association. The Editorial Board attended the election debate Tuesday to hear the platforms of the five tickets.After reviewing the party platforms and hearing the candidates debate, the Editorial Board endorses Empower IU for the 2017 IUSA election.Overall, we felt Empower IU President Dan Niersbach showcased a platform founded on pragmatic, data-driven policy. The ticket intends to gather this data by conducting student surveys to gauge where funds should be allocated and by studying successful policies implemented at other universities. While all other tickets had their respective merits, Empower IU’s focal points expressed determination and realism through their short-and-long term plans.For example, Empower IU pledged unequivocal support to undocumented students but acknowledged that declaring IU as a sanctuary campus is more complicated than it sounds. Accomplishing such a task involves the combined efforts of the university and the community it represents as well as the state government. The University could lose critical funding if it officially identifies as a sanctuary campus without the state government’s support.Despite this challenge, Empower IU has been working with the UndocuHoosier Alliance to ensure access to a quality education for everyone on campus.All the tickets promised to value input from student organizations, but only Empower IU pledged to send representatives to meetings and events held by those organizations.Previously, students in other organizations would be required to attend an IUSA meeting to have their voices heard. We appreciate this active approach to advocacy and collaboration.We’re sure you’ve been barraged by buzzwords like campus safety and freedom of speech, so we want to tell you about Empower IU’s concrete initiatives to address these issues.With regard to safety, Empower IU wants to incorporate liaisons between the IUPD and students at risk of sexual assault like sororities and the LGBT community on campus.This will encourage victims of sexual violence to reach out to familiar faces who can then contact the authorities. Many people fear interacting directly with the University or police on sexual crimes, and this initiative aims to encourage a higher reporting rate.At the debate, Niersbach also spoke emphatically about freedom of speech. He said that IU should welcome speakers from different ideologies and encourage students to challenge their ideas while on campus. If these speakers incite violence between students, however, the University should step in.Engage with IU, Empower IU’s toughest competitor at the debate, also expressed strong support for student advocacy. However, the Editorial Board concluded that Empower IU’s platform was more practical given a one-year term in office.We believe student voices will be best heard through Empower IU because it is a ticket that will use data-driven strategies to determine policy. Empower IU offers a distinct balance between passion and pragmatism that will best serve the student body.Opinion Editor Zack Chambers is involved on an IUSA ticket and had no input on the Editorial Board’s decision.',\n",

       "  'body': 'For the past several months, IU’s department for Public Safety and Institutional Assurance has worked to develop a new blog page, Safe IU Bloomington.The department said it hopes to create more traffic on the blog and make it a new, popular public resource for information related to Bloomington crime and safety.“The impetus for this started last fall when students were concerned about safety related incidents that happened off-campus that our police are not involved with,” Tracy James, assurance communications manager for IU, said.Last September, the Bloomington Police Department responded to a string of connected break-ins on the south side of campus — two break-ins involved sexual assault attempts. Some break-in victims were IU students.James said the IU Police Department did not respond to these calls because of IUPD’s limited radius.“IUPD’s jurisdiction is campus property,” James said. “IU-Notify emergency alerts warn of threats occurring on campus or heading toward campus, like a tornado or armed suspect.”Although IU-Notify and other similar alert systems are helpful for students, James said student leaders expressed concerns and a desire for additional resources about threats that take place off-campus, but still close enough to affect students.“Some of those incidents occurred three and four miles off campus, and so it’s just a matter of we don’t even know about these things,” James said.Senior Sara Zaheer, president of the IU Student Association and a member of the Campus-Community Coalition, played a vital role in the development of the new blog. Because of her leadership positions, Zaheer said she has special access to crime information and campus safety officials. However, not all students have this ability.“One of the platform initiatives we ran on last year as REAL for IUSA was to connect students to more information about crime happening in their neighborhoods since a majority of students live off-campus,” Zaheer said. “We know the University’s notification system has its own guidelines and limitations, but we wanted to see a place where students could opt in for information about recent events or trends in crime.”With the help of the Public Safety and Institutional Assurance department, the Safe IU Bloomington blog was developed. Any time IUPD or BPD report an incident, especially one that could be threatening to students, James and her department will inquire about further information and attempt to update the blog with a post.Relevant topics that are featured in recent posts include details about the upcoming tornado drill testing, harassment reports and two vehicle fires that occurred at a parking lot off-campus last month.Aside from posts with information and small article-type blurbs, the blog has a resources tab which identifies links, like the IUPD and BPD social media pages, a Bloomington crime map, legal services for students and more.The blog encourages student interaction and engagement, like compiling pictures of students who used the hashtag #IUShelterSelfie in preparation for this week’s tornado testing.“This was a way for students to directly give input about where they get their information from and how they would like the University to communicate with them,” Zaheer said.James said she is interested in hearing student feedback and what they think is helpful information in order to adjust and evolve the blog further.“Now on the Safe IU Bloomington blog, they can learn more about what’s going on in the community and get preventative tips to have a safer experience during their time here,” Zaheer said.',\n",

Things are happening every day to bring marginalized people into the crosshairs.”Myers will moderate for the panel although she said she would much rather attend the event than be the host because she is so excited about how the event will come together.Myers said she wanted to get influential people from both the Bloomington and IU communities involved. Panelists from Middle Way House, the IU Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures and the wider collegiate community will be in attendance.“I want to show that campus and the community are interconnected,” Myers said. “We cannot let issues like this divide us.”Asma Afsaruddin, IU professor in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, will provide information about Islamaphobia and violence against Muslim women.Kali Gross, from Wesleyan University, will put the issues into perspective in a wider national collegiate community.Evelyn Smith, Middle Way outreach coordinator, will provide details on crimes and services in the local Bloomington community.“Especially at IU, there are so many people with all of these skills and abilities,” Myers said. “I thought, ‘Let’s give them a microphone. Let’s highlight them.’ We are a research university. So much work is being done. Let’s share it.”Myers planned performances from two of IU’s award-winning performers. Nyama McCarthy-Brown will be performing a choreographed dance before the panel to tell a story Muslim women and the Islamic faith preceding the panel discussions, and Ross Gay will be presenting one of his original poems written for the event to transition from the panel to the justice fair across the hall in the University Club.“I really hope people come out,” Myers said. “I hope they come and read the information, learn something from the panel and want to get engaged. I encourage everyone to come out. There are so many feeling vulnerable and need to see our support. We are hoping to make a safer place for everyone.”Myers said she has seen a rise in hate crimes against women of color and transgender women. Psychologist and co-founder of Open Door, a therapy center for gay men, Graciela Balestra said the average life expectancy of transgender people is 30-32 years. Myers said this is mostly due to the high number of transgender murder victims.\"We do not think this type of violence happens here, but it does,” Myers said.',\n",

They said students with a low socio-economic status who would otherwise need to spend their time working are then able to have an IUSA position.Members of IGNITE said there are alternatives to decreasing IUSA's budget. They said increasing IU's revenue by doing things, such as selling alcohol at sporting events is one method to do so.Focus for IUSA President junior Brandon Sakbun said his ticket wants to use the funds to engage in cross-campus collaboration. He said the ticket wants to work with organizations like Safe Sisters and Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault that are not given as much funding as IUSA.“We’re all here for the same reason — to make IU a better place,” Sakbun said.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Accompanying unsolicited questions about lack of clothing and alcohol consumption, survivors of sexual assault and rape are often asked why they didn’t do anything to stop their attacker.That a person amid danger could freeze up and involuntarily release control is scary and difficult for most people to wrap their mind around. But it’s a naturally occurring response that we forget to talk about when dealing with assault. Adopting the freeze response into the conversation will help explain misconceptions about rape and sexual assault and lessen the stigma toward those who’ve faced it.Many psychologists understand the binary fight-or-flight response as old and not explanatory for cases where victims freeze. In a 2015 Washington Post article, James Hopper, Ph.D., explains the freeze response is “a brain-based response to detecting danger, especially a predator’s attack. Think deer in the headlights.”While the body is prepared to attack or flee, when freezing occurs, “neither fight nor flight necessarily follows,” he writes.Acknowledging assault in terms of the freeze response can stop the people from imagining a hierarchy of sexual assault and rape, which labels attacks by opportunistic predators as real crimes and attacks by lovers, friends or acquaintances as less serious.Data updated in 2015 from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center found that in eight out of 10 cases of rape, the victim and assailant previously knew each other.That means the vast majority of cases deal with survivors who had an established relationship with their attackers as opposed to those assaulted by a stranger lurking in the middle of the night.Think about how realistic it would be for a victim to use the fight-or-flight response if attacked by someone they knew.Think about how strange and shocking it would be to experience the normalcy of a human relationship replaced by a criminal overstepping of boundaries. Unfortunately many, including victims, aren’t able to comprehend this.Hopper writes that victims “blame themselves for ‘failing’ to resist. They feel ashamed,” according to the Post. “They may tell no one, even during an investigation. Sadly, many investigators and prosecutors still don’t know some or all of these brain-based responses.”Freezing out of shock or fear is a justified reaction. When we begin to accept the freeze response as common, we’ll start to understand reactions to sexual assault and rape better and take all cases of these crimes more seriously.For the assault cases where victims flee or fight back, there will be many more where victims will freeze.The ordinariness of the response is evident not only in the psychology of danger but also in our culture’s tendency to wonder why the victim did nothing to stop it.Next time you hear of a sexual assault or rape report, stop yourself from stooping to skepticism over the survivor’s response or pointing out what she or he failed to do. Refining your thinking will lessen the blame placed on sexual assault victims in the long run.jsbourkl@umail.iu.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'With an unprecedented six tickets running in this year’s IU Student Association election, candidates are tasked with distinguishing their platforms from those of their five opponents.So far four campaigns have launched websites outlining their policy goals and profiling their four executive candidates. The Psych Up campaign has released their executive candidates while one ticket, Refund Supreme, has announced only a presidential candidate.Focus for IUSAThe Focus ticket is led by junior Brandon Sakbun, the current adviser to the vice president of Congress. Sakbun said his passion for civic duty and the potential for greatness he saw in student government is part of what prompted him to get involved in the IUSA election.An issue Sakbun said he observed in past IUSA congresses was a focus on decorum and formality instead of the quality of debate. He said he admires the current administration, but he’s also the type of person who wants to continue raising the bar and improving student government.“I don’t believe in saying ‘all Congress members will wear business casual at bare minimum,’” Sakbun said. “That’s not what I’m focused on. What I’m focused on is the quality of the debate and what issues they’re talking about.”Still, Sakbun said he understands professionalism and standards because he is a member of the Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program. He also interned in both legislative and executive branch offices in Washington, D.C., last semester. He said the experience reinforced his desire to give back to his community.Focus’ executive team will assess all possibilities when confronting an issue or advocating for students to the IU Board of Trustees, Sakbun said. It is confident in its ability to adapt to environments in order to be effective, a skill Sakbun said he borrows from the military.“I’m 100 percent prepared to walk in the room and say, ‘this is what the students want,’” Sakbun said.Another goal Sakbun said he hopes to accomplish is raising awareness of student government by reassessing how IUSA markets itself. Focus’ plan is to have a monthly town hall in collaboration with student groups and cultural centers, which would open conversations to people who might not feel a part of student government decision-making.“My plan is if 10-percent of the student body population knows about IUSA, I want 20 percent to know by the end of fall semester and 40 percent to know by the end of next year,” Sakbun said.Engage with IUSAThe Engage ticket is led by junior Michelle Long, who said she has assisted with policy planning and communication between IUSA, faculty and administrators in the past and been involved with student orientation and other programs that help foster IU’s “Culture of Care.”“First and foremost our campaign is focused on something that’s a lot bigger than IUSA itself,” Long said. “We’re really trying to spark more campus engagement and help students grow into their own autonomy.”Long said the campaign is committed to meeting with all members of the campus community with a priority on engaging students who may feel left behind or disenfranchised from IUSA.Of the many policies on Engage’s website, Long said their diversity and inclusion plans are the most pressing, given the current political climate, though she admitted it was hard to say they prioritized this over other important platform issues.Some inclusion initiatives involve increasing accessibility for people with physical disabilities, creating an interfaith prayer room on campus and incorporating electronic benefit transfer and other types of food stamps into meal plans.“Everything that I’ve done on campus is to make sure Hoosiers feel more comfortable and safe,” Long said.Empower IUDan Niersbach, a junior, is the presidential candidate for the Empower IU ticket, though he said the campaign is more focused on proposed policy than it is on individual candidates. Niersbach said he wants to give marginalized students more input in campus affairs and bring a new level of professionalism to IUSA.“We strongly believe the organization should exist on campus for the students on campus not ourselves,” Niersbach said.Empower IU’s mission is divided into three pillars: a sense of continuity and longevity planning, the fostering of a positive professional culture and the creation of avenues for students to have their voice amplified by the student government. Each of Empower IU’s six platform departments have been split up into specific policies, which Niersbach said may sound ambitious but hopes will also be effective.Niersbach said the goal of longevity planning is for policy to keep its momentum with future administrations. Some plans are targeted toward helping certain marginalized groups succeed and have a voice on campus, what he called pointed policy, while other initiatives are part of a larger, five-year plan. Plans that fit into the latter category include some environmental sustainability and mental health initiatives.Empower IU is the biggest campaign team Niersbach has seen since coming to IU, he said. The ticket has candidates for 60 of the 62 congressional seats and staff members working on each policy area.He also emphasized strong support for undocumented students. He said they intend to communicate and meet with different groups and get their persepctives as well. fThe importance of faculty and staff, whose safety and ability to continue their work and study on campus is essential to Empower IU’s values was also a major point for Niersbach.Sophomore Olivia Malone Empower IU’s chief of staff, said the amount of research she has seen put into crafting policy distinguishes the campaign from others. In addition to extensive research on policy, Malone said the campaign has and will continue to reach out to student groups to co-sponsor specific policies that may affect them. Malone also said Empower IU has a goal of increasing the level of collaboration between the executive and legislative branches of IUSA.“We’re not just focusing on the ticket, we’re focusing on everyone as a really important part of what we’re doing,” Malone said. “And I think that’s what student government should be doing more of: emphasizing the fact that we’re not just four people, that we’re more than that, and that’s what makes us strong.”IGNITE for IUSAIGNITE for IUSA’s ticket is led by sophomore Will Mckinney, who said he wanted IUSA students to look forward to the vision his ticket would provide. Like other campaigns, Mckinney said he wants to open up the discussion to students who aren’t directly involved with student government.He said every member who is in student government should actively contribute to decisions, which he hopes will be the standard if his ticket wins the election.“It’s kind of like a group project where one or two of the people in the group do all the work, and the rest are all along for the ride,” Mckinney said. “I want it to be more collaborative.”Mckinney said IGNITE’s platform is split into three divisions of policy creation: traditional, which is what most students would expect of normal legislative processes; collaborative, where the discussion is opened to other students outside of student government; and a final strategy, distinct to IGNITE’s campaign.“Then we have something called gladiator, which I think is really cool,” McKinney said. “Our campaign is willing to go where other campaigns aren’t. When we have an idea, and we want it, and we know students want it, we’re not going to stop.”This gladiator strategy would entail pushing campus administrators until the answer on a question is a definite “yes” or “no.”Mckinney said power in IUSA is balanced in favor of the executive branch, something he wants to change if elected. A lot of great ideas have originated in IUSA’s executive branch, he said, but they need to be followed up by actions, a task better accomplished when power is shared with other branches of the student government and the student body as a whole.Psych UpThe cornerstone of Psych Up’s platform is focusing the IUSA budget on programs that benefit the community and are not wasteful in nature.“It’s about refunding the money back to programs that actually benefit the students, not just the IUSA,” said Kyle Yohler, Psych Up’s treasurer candidate.Yohler said the current IUSA administration’s use of funding for luncheons, executive scholarships and guest speakers was a mismanagement of student fees, which could be redirected to initiatives which do not only benefit members of student government. Psych Up plans to keep some of the current budget items, like sexual and mental health initiatives that benefit the student body as a whole, Yohler said.He said he and his fellow ticket members had previously discussed the self-spending, which is what prompted them to get involved in this year’s election.Yohler said along with funding for Counseling and Psychological Services and mental health awareness initiatives, Psych Up plans to keep funding for programs like sexual health awareness and IUSA’s freshman internship program.The campaign is candidate-run, Yohler said, and they plan on relying on word of mouth rather than social media and web-based methods of promoting their ticket.Refund SupremeRefund Supreme has not announced the rest of its executive slate beyond presidential candidate Sarah Yde. Campaign manager Samuel Patterson, a junior, said their campaign is libertarian-leaning and wants to reduce government waste.“Our main platform is to refund the student fee by cutting inappropriate spending,” he later said in an email.Patterson said Refund Supreme wants to keep budget items such as culture of care initiatives, flowers for the families of deceased students and programs focused on drug and alcohol education. They would like to eliminate the flow of student fees to events like luncheons and other expenditures that only benefit members of IUSA.He said there are proposed policies on inclusion, sustainability and other common areas but said the plan to refund student fees is the campaign’s distinguishing characteristic.“Our main platform is to refund as much of the student fee as possible,” Patterson later said in an email. “The IUSA executives spend huge amounts of money on scholarships, parking passes, banquets, luncheons, and trips for themselves. We’re going to give that money back to the students.”He said Refund Supreme wants to empower students by being transparent. Meetings of congress would be videotaped and posted online, and IUSA office hours would be turned into open meetings for the public to meet with executive members.“On issues like recycling, sexual assault, mental health, late-night safety, and campus jobs we agree with the other tickets,” Patterson said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'In her many years spent at just one organization, Toby Strout worked to improve the lives of more than 60,000 people affected by domestic and sexual violence in and around Bloomington.Strout, executive director of Middle Way House for 30 years before she retired, died Monday. She was 71.Strout was raised by a family of activists and was always a champion for equality herself, Anna Strout, Toby Strout’s daughter, said.Strout was a public school teacher in New York City for several years, where she was very involved in protests and social justice, Anna said. She moved to Bloomington to earn her Ph.D. in instructional systems technology from IU’s School of Education.Strout first became involved with Middle Way House, a nonprofit organization that serves victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, as a board member. She became its executive director in 1987.“My mother wouldn’t rest until she was certain every person — especially women — had equal rights and a say in their own lives,” Anna said. “I honor her daily through the work I’m now engaged in and committed to.”One of Anna’s favorite memories of her mother is Strout’s frequent bus trips to protests and marches in Washington, D.C.Throughout her career at Middle Way House, Strout would often take buses of women, including many living in Middle Way House’s transitional housing as well as Anna and her friends, to the nation’s capital to participate in marches for many social equality issues, including women’s rights. She would sing old labor songs, like “If I Had a Hammer” and “We Shall Overcome,” the whole way there, Anna said.“She turned me and all of my friends into feminists,” Anna said.In Strout’s lifetime, she got to see the expansion of Middle Way House’s services to areas in the region beyond Bloomington and the closing of the mortgage on the New Wings facility, a building opened in 2010. The closing of the mortgage was accomplished in part through a fundraiser begun by Jesse Eisenberg last year.“I have truly never seen somebody with such a specific mission and resolute focus as Toby,” Eisenberg, Anna’s partner, said. “She had a simultaneously fastidious and creative approach to her work.”Strout helped to choose Debra Morrow as Middle Way House’s next executive director. Morrow started working in her new position this January.Morrow was initially a client of Middle Way House, living in the organization’s transitional housing. Morrow said her admiration of Strout’s leadership helped motivate her to continue working with Middle Way House.“Going to work with an organization run by Toby sounded like the best job in the world,” Morrow said. “When you look at her time here, you realize that thousands of people have been helped because of her work. Toby touched so many people in this community.”Morrow recalled a time when she was living in transitional housing when she ran into Strout after coming home from work for the day. Strout stood next to Morrow and spoke to her like her equal, Morrow said.“I don’t even remember what we talked about, but that made me feel so good, and I walked away thinking, ‘Maybe I am somebody,’” Morrow said. “When you’ve been through violence and you’re in a situation like that, it is so hard to feel as though you’re anyone’s equal. That meant so much to me.”When Morrow was working as Middle Way House’s community service coordinator, Strout once showed up to a bingo night Morrow organized for the women living there. Strout sat and played bingo with them the whole night. Morrow said she hoped she could maintain such a personal connection to the people she worked with the way Strout did.Strout’s work also extended to IU, where Middle Way House worked to educate students about sexual assault and domestic violence.Many students have used Middle Way House’s services, Anna said, and many have volunteered and interned with the organization as well.Middle Way House recently began a fund in Strout’s honor, the Toby Strout VOICES Fund. VOICES, which stands for Visualizing Opportunities, Independence, Choices and Empowerment for Survivors, is meant to allow community members to contribute to the furthering of Strout’s mission.“The work’s never done, that’s what she would always say, and that’s especially true now,” Anna said. “She wanted to make sure we never shirked our responsibility to each other.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'For the sake of entertainment, movie and television audiences willfully suspend their disbelief and hope this sacrifice will prove to be rewarding. We give up — at least in part — the cynicism we apply to our daily lives in exchange for something that we expect will make those lives a little easier to bear.Lately, though, it feels like we’re giving up a little more than our skeptical sensibilities.On Sunday night, Casey Affleck, who settled two lawsuits recently for sexual harassment allegations in 2010 with women from the set of film “I’m Still Here,” accepted the Academy Award for best actor for his performance in “Manchester by the Sea.” This once again demonstrates what contemporary culture confirms ad nauseum: Sexual assault, at least in the eyes of those currently in power, is not an offense for which a man will be denied success.To make matters worse, the duty of presenting Affleck with his award fell to Brie Larson. Larson, who had to present Affleck with a Golden Globe for the same role in “Manchester” and who won the Oscar for best actress in 2016 for her role as a rape survivor in “Room,” refused to hug him when he came to the stage.Some may argue that introducing a moral litmus test to the Oscars would be a dicey process that could dangerously stifle art. Others may say that Casey Affleck truly gave the best performance of any male actor in a leading role this past year.I hardly think demanding actors to refrain from sexually violating other human beings would unduly harm the film industry. Anyone for whom that demand would pose a problem does not deserve the power and privilege celebrities acquire. Surely our country’s cinema scene is not so hopelessly lacking in talent as to depend on men accused of sexual assault for its survival.If your alleged victims suffer, so should your career. Although there is no way to provide full justice for survivors of sexual assault, we cannot simply take that to mean that no consequences are necessary whatsoever.Adopting a more optimistic perspective on the actions Hollywood could take to improve, it is clear that reform would need to start long before awards season began. Directors should make casting choices more carefully and weed out candidates with dangerous histories like Affleck’s from the very beginning.Such was clearly not the case with “Manchester by the Sea,” nor do I expect that kind of screening process — though fair and sorely needed — to become a new standard. The least the film industry could do, then, is decline to reward people like Casey Affleck with the highest honors available.It is painful to know that such a claim, which simply argues that sexual assault survivors deserve the dignity of seeing their wellbeing prioritized above the success of their attackers, will be met with resistance.In his acceptance speech, Affleck admitted that he wished he “had something bigger and more meaningful to say.” I wish that, too, Casey; something along the lines of an apology, or a refusal to accept the award would have been more appropriate.mareklei@umail.iu.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Are you still reeling from the last few minutes of Sunday’s Oscars? You’re not alone. After presenter Warren Beatty announced “La La Land” as the Best Picture winner only to crown “Moonlight” about a minute later, the legacy of the 89th Academy Awards show was cemented.After that gaffe and the hurried exit of the “La La Land” team, the production team and cast of “Moonlight” celebrated. Although his Best Picture win didn’t come under ideal circumstances, director Barry Jenkins had his chance to make an eloquent speech earlier that night for Best Adapted Screenplay.“You know, I told my students that I teach sometimes ‘be in love with the process, not the result,’ but I really wanted this result because a bajillion people were watching,” “Moonlight” director Barry Jenkins said. “And for all you people out there who feel there is no mirror for you, that you feel your life is not reflected, the Academy has your back ... and for the next four years we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you.”“Moonlight” took the first award of the night when actor Mahershala Ali won the Oscar for Actor in a Supporting Role and thanked his teachers, managers and wife. Ali is the first Muslim actor to win an Academy Award.Asghar Farhadi, who directed “The Salesman,” won a second Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and, instead of accepting the award traditionally, made a strong political statement. The Iranian director, who had been barred from the United States when President Trump’s Muslim ban went into effect, boycotted the show entirely.“My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.,” Farhadi’s statement read. “Dividing the world into the ‘us’ and ‘our enemies’ categories creates fear, a deceitful justification for aggression and war.”“La La Land,” nominated for 14 Oscars, left with only six wins. Emma Stone took home a statue for Actress in a Leading Role, and the film also won Best Director, Best Original Score, Best Song for “City of Stars,” Best Cinematography and Best Production Design.Viola Davis took home the gold for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for “Fences,” and her impassioned speech was one for the ages. Her victory came after two previous losses, for “Doubt” and “The Help.”Unsurprisingly, Casey Affleck’s performance in “Manchester by the Sea” outweighed the accusations of sexual assault that came out last year against him. He won the Oscar for Actor in a Leading Role.“Suicide Squad” eked out an Oscar win for Makeup and Hairstyling. The poorly-reviewed DC film now has more Oscars than “Rear Window,” “It’s a Wonderful Life,” “Psycho” and “The Shawshank Redemption.”Sound Mixing nominee and famously long-time loser Kevin O’Connell won his first Oscar last night after 21 nominations. The “Hacksaw Ridge” mixer thanked his deceased mother in his award speech, who he said had encouraged him to aspire toward an Academy Award.Despite the Best Picture snafu, the 2017 Academy Awards were surprising and satisfactory. Overwhelming love for “La La Land” did not prevail, despite its original 14 nominations, and the Academy instead spread the love between a variety of deserving films.',\n",

       "  'body': 'A black tarp hung low to cover the blackboard. Two black lamps illuminated six performers as they stood in front of a dark lecture hall. Classes had ended, but people filled Woodburn 003 Friday evening, and they were talking. They were talking about vaginas.“My vagina is angry,” said performer Hayley Kwasniewski, throwing her hands in the air as she performed a monologue. “It’s pissed off. My vagina is furious, and it needs to talk.”The Feminist Student Association organized the performance of Eve Ensler’s “The Vagina Monologues” on Friday and Saturday night. Proceeds from ticket sales were donated to the Middle Way House. Around 50 people attended the Friday night performance.Six women performed pieces from “The Vagina Monologues,” an Obie Award-winning play based on interviews Ensler had with more than 200 women. The monologues tell women’s stories of sex, love, assault, birth and more.The six actresses were former IU student Georgia Boonshoft and IU students Hayley Kwasniewski, Thea Bransby, Patricia O’Brian, Stephanie Whitlock and Caroline Hewitt. Hewitt is a copy editor at the IDS. Tessa Huber, a student, directed the performance.Kwasniewski performed “My Angry Vagina,” which spoke out against the routine things women must go through including using tampons, going to the gynecologist and wearing thongs.“Let’s just begin with tampons,” Kwasniewski said. “What the hell is that? A dry wad of fucking cotton stuffed up there.”Kwasniewski, pacing the front and gesturing rapdily as she described how women hate going to the gynecologist, continued.“Why the flashlight all up there like Nancy Drew working against gravity?” she said. “Why the mean, cold duck lips they shove inside you? What is that?”“Reclaiming Cunt,” a different monologue, detailed one woman’s goal to transform people’s perception of the slur into something more positive.Event organizer Margaret Hoffman said FSA puts this show on every year to get people talking openly about vaginas. She had been busy all last week preparing and Friday carrying the lamps across campus to set up for the show.“We never talk about what it’s like to actually have a vagina,” Hoffman said. “Vaginas are normal. It’s odd we’re not talking about them more.”In general, Hoffman said people don’t talk about their genitals, and high school sexual education classes don’t do enough to teach women about the anatomy of vaginas. Through these performances, Hoffman said the goal was to normalize the discussion.A change to this year’s performance included the decision not to perform a monologue about a transgender person because they could not find a trans performer and did not want to cast a cisgendered person in the role, Hoffman said.Throughout the show, the audience laughed at the pieces, especially those that spoke to everyday troubles of being a woman, but not all the monologues were humorous. One — “The Little Coochie Snorcher That Could” — detailed a teenage girl’s experience with being assaulted by her father’s best friend.The show ended with a monologue about the birth of Ensler’s granddaughter. Ensler, the show’s creator, was in the room as the baby was born. It highlighted Ensler’s awe and reverence she felt witnessing the birth.Freshman Alexia Barraza attended the show with her friends Madelaine Withers and Moira Kehoe as a part of their Friday night outing.Barraza said she cried, especially during the childbirth monologue. She said she felt every emotion of the show.All said they agreed the performance was powerful.“It reminded us that we’re not alone,” Withers said.After Saturday’s performance, FSA had personal monologues at the Bishop Bar. FSA members and others who were interested performed their own monologues detailing their stories.',\n",

Cowie is a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and sat down with the Indiana Daily Student to discuss his job and the community he not only belongs to but also helps govern.IDS: What have you learned and accomplished since becoming president?Cowie: The first month and a half have been pretty busy. We attended a national leadership conference for all IFCs across the country. We changed how we scheduled our weekly president meetings. We have set up roundtables for chapter presidents to discuss the issues their chapters face.IDS: What do you still hope to accomplish?Cowie: I still hope to accomplish the chapter evaluation plan, allowing for each chapter to share with the community in order to find areas of improvements. To understand how we as an IFC executive board can act as a resource to improve. I think really trying to get this chapter evaluation plan up and running.The vice presidents and myself on executive board have been coming up with questions. It will target 12 to 15 categories from leadership structure to senior leadership in the fraternity to look at each of the chapters within these categories and from that we are going to give an assessment to each chapter. We are going to say here’s what you are doing really well, and here’s what we want you to keep doing.IDS: What challenges do you face as president and how do you balance being a fraternity member and being in charge?Cowie: I think the most important thing is communication, being able to communicate effectively knowing when you have to have moments, knowing when it’s relaxing-with-the-guys time or stepping up to be a leader. It’s about making those conscious decisions and being able to communicate most effectively when you do it.IDS: What has IFC done to bolster its anti-hazing policies this semester?Cowie: This semester we took a very proactive approach when reviewing each chapters new member education program just to make sure that each program was educational and structured. We think hazing occurs when there’s a lack of structure or plan within the new member education process. If things aren’t planned out and set in stone ahead of time that’s when hazing can occur when there’s downtime and they don’t know what to do to the guys. We have to make sure that there are not opportunities for hazing to occur.IDS: What’re you doing and aiming to do differently in order to tackle the issue of sexual assault in the IFC community?We have revamped our Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault program to now include a more significant portion of the new members in the greek community. So that when they enter in, we can establish a strong foundation and say there is no place for sexual assault. Also training them to what that can look like and how to prevent it. The MARS team will create handouts to reinforce the teachings that go on in hopes to create community that is more knowledgeable about what sexual assault looks like and to be a community that holds each other accountable.IDS: Are there any stereotypes about the greek community you would like to address?Cowie: The biggest stereotype is that people join these organizations just to party or to be able to live in a giant house, if it’s a housed organization. What people may not see is the philanthropic benefits that comes with it and the strong sense of brotherhood that comes with being in a fraternity. We should try to promote the multidimensional facets of fraternities and to promote the ideas of community. We should constantly be making that conscious effort to evaluate how a chapter runs and to make sure that we are doing things not because that’s how we’ve always done it.',\n",

       "  'body': 'On Monday, the moment we all should have been waiting for arrived. Simon & Schuster announced it would cancel its publication of Milo Yiannopoulos’ forthcoming book, “Dangerous.”Yiannopoulos’ hateful, “alt-right” beliefs, often attributed to the white nationalist movement, are in fact dangerous. They don’t deserve to be published. Simon & Schuster is not, however, the only organization poised to harm his career.On top of the rescinded book deal, the Conservative Political Action Conference uninvited Yiannopoulos from its events this week.Even Breitbart News is reconsidering its affiliation with Yiannopoulos, who remains a senior editor of the publication as of Monday. According to an anonymous Breitbart journalist interviewed by the New York Times, the far-right media source is considering parting ways with its most irreverent provocateur.Maybe people are realizing that the man whose racist harassment of Leslie Jones got him permanently banned from Twitter might not deserve their support.Perhaps they recognized his extremism misrepresented their ideological standings and, through this extremism’s encouragement of discriminatory behavior, posed a threat to all non-white, non-male human beings.Although the above reasons should have been sufficient to undermine Yiannopoulos’ success, his downfall required the resurfacing of a YouTube video from last year in which he condones pedophilia and describes contemporary definitions of consent as “arbitrary and oppressive.”For a while now, I have been wondering when and where we would draw the line for Yiannopoulos. Apparently racism, sexism and hate speech were not enough. We required evidence that he condoned sexual encounters with underage boys and disregarded the prevalence of their prevalence among Catholic priests.I find it deeply satisfying that Yiannopoulos, a man who once attended a rape culture protest known as a SlutWalk with a sign saying “Rape Culture and Harry Potter: Both Fantasy,” is now facing sweeping disavowal for his gross insensitivity to sexual assault.To those who defended this flagrantly bigoted man in the name of free speech, and to those who may still defend him as a victim of censorship, I have to ask whether or not it’s our responsibility to respond to those who abuse their freedoms.I’m sure that much of the upcoming discussion of Simon & Schuster and CPAC’s decisions will invoke the first amendment. While Yiannopoulos is protected by the Constitution from any attempt by congress to abridge “the freedom of speech, or of the press,” he does not have the right to have his written work published by a private company simply because it expresses his opinion.It is in no way disputable that women and people of color deserve equality, that rape culture is a tragically problematic condition of our lives, or that consent for sexual activity is vital. Much of what Milo Yiannopoulos writes and speaks, then, is not opinion but hatred.It’s abhorrent for him to suggest that feminism is cancer or that he loves the “populist, nationalist, antiglobalist rebellion happening all over the West,” as he declares in Business Insider. Besides these, any point that “Dangerous” proposed about freedom of speech or conservative ideology could just as easily be made by more intelligent and agreeable political representatives.We know this, and we must act on that knowledge. Though I will hardly forgive it for their initial transgression, Simon & Schuster was correct in its decision to revoke a platform for hate speech.mareklei@umail.iu.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'Current and former IU students and a former IU faculty member await court hearings in the local courts for various criminal charges. The IDS has reported on each of these cases. Here’s a run-down of where each case stands in the local Monroe County Circuit Courts:James McGovernJames McGovern, 21, is an IU student, charged with rape and criminal confinement. McGovern allegedly raped a female friend Feb. 15, after he met up with her at a bar downtown and brought her back to his apartment.He was held in Monroe County Correctional Center but was released after posting bond. He has yet to appear in court.WhisperA group of four men, including two IU students and one IU graduate, were arrested for having sex, independent of one another, with a 13-year-old girl. Each of them met and chatted with her through the social media app, Whisper, which allows people to chat anonymously. Current police evidence suggests the men knew she was underage.Matthew Filipek, 23, and George Pearcy, 21, are IU students. Another man, Thomas Snape, 23, graduated from the IU Kelley School of Business in 2015 with a degree in accounting, according to his LinkedIn account. All are facing child molestation charges.All of the men pleaded not guilty at initial hearings last week. Filipek has a pretrial conference scheduled for March 30. As of now, there are no upcoming court events scheduled in the cases of Snape and Pearcy.Jason CoxJason Cox, 21, is an IU student who accidentally shot his roommate Nov. 9. He is charged with criminal recklessness with a deadly weapon and pointing a firearm at another.While Cox’s roommate was outside their apartment with his girlfriend, Cox allegedly picked up a Smith & Wesson .40 caliber handgun and pointed it at his friend through the window. Cox accidentally pulled the trigger when his roommate turned to face him, shooting him in the mouth. The roommate was airlifted to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis.Police said Cox appeared to be under the influence at the time of the shooting. He was arrested but has since bonded out. He has a pretrial conference scheduled for March 9.Guoping WangGuoping Wang is a former Jacobs School of Music lecturer and dance coach, who is accused of sexually assaulting multiple students he worked with.The first reports of sexual assault came from anincident in fall 2015, when he was rehearsing with a ballet student for “The Nutcracker.”Wang asked the student to come to his office to work on stretches.He attempted to kiss the girl and tear off her leotard despite her protests, according to a probable cause affidavit. The girl was able to redress and leave after Wang got up to check on a disturbance in the hallway.The student reported the assault to the University in March 2016, at which point the University launched an investigation into Wang. Over the course of the investigation, six other students came forward with sexual assault allegations against Wang.He was fired in May.The University did not share its findings with police until six weeks after the student’s initial report of the assault.Wang was arrested in July, but has been out on bond since then.At his most recent pretrial conference, Wang’s attorney, Katharine Liell, requested a change of venue for Wang’s trial, citing negative press coverage.Wang’s next pretrial conference is scheduled for 2 p.m. on March 1.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Indiana University has made a point to educate its students about sexual assault.Because of the efforts made by the Indiana Daily Student, Culture of Care and the Student Board of efforts, it is hard for the Opinion Editorial board to hear about the recent sexual assault case involving the app Whisper.Four men from Monroe county were recently arrested on child molestation charges. Two of the men arrested, George W. R. Pearcy and Matthew J. Filipek, are students at IU.Though all four men are innocent until proven guilty, the Editorial Board believes this is a good time to reflect on how this situation affects IU’s activism and the way the community views its fight against sexual assault.IU joined the fight against sexual assault by taking on the nationwide “It’s On US” slogan, coined by former President Barack Obama in 2014. Since then, other organizations on campus have taken up the fight against sexual assault as well.Culture of Care promotes sexual well-being and the idea of no longer being the bystander but caring for our classmates instead.Last semester, the investigation desk at the IDS ran a three-part special on sexual assault at IU where columnists encouraged students to share their stories.The investigation revealed how many students still didn’t realize how common and probable sexual assault is at IU.While IU’s existing activism educates students about sexual assault, informs them of how to protect themselves against it and how to report it afterwards, we need to examine whether we’re doing a good enough job.These organizations and IU as a community spends so much time informing informing students about how to protect themselves from sexual assault, yet it seems these organizations aren’t doing enough to dissaude the assaulters.Situations like the Whisper case occur because not enough offenders are being held responsible, and instead of telling victims that they are the ones who need to prevent sexual assault, IU should turn its focus to the potential offenders.To make matters worse, IU student James McGovern was arrested on Friday on charges of rape and criminal confinement.Perhaps there needs to be a way for those who are unsure whether or not they are committing sexual assault to speak with someone and get a better understanding of the damage they are causing, while also being held responsible.We cannot only punish the few who are caught because while this shows some are being caught, it also showcases the large amount of sexual offenders who are getting away with it because of intimidation and stigma placed on the victims.Of course, the education about prevention and what it means to sexually assault someone will not always dissuade someone from committing a sexual crime.Despite the fact that this specific crime has taken place off campus with a minor, it cannot be totally separate from IU.Those accused are affiliated with IU and that is always going to look bad for the University.If the University wants to prevent further potential blame, it needs to create stricter expectations of students and follow through when a crime is committed.The dangerous atmosphere of sexual assault at IU will ultimately deter potential students from enrolling in the future.',\n",

While contenders like Damien Chazelle and Mahershala Ali almost certainly will win their categories, who should win?Best PictureOscars night is going to end with a “La La Land” victory, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. While a few critics are making a last minute stand for “Moonlight” or “Hidden Figures,” the odds that either of those films can overtake “La La Land” are incredibly slim. That said, a victory for “Moonlight” would go down in history as not only deserved, but necessary. Keep hope alive!Will win: La La LandShould win: MoonlightBest DirectorEven more of a lock than a Best Picture win for “La La Land” is a Best Director win for Damien Chazelle. Weekend would love to see “Moonlight” director Barry Jenkins slip in and upset, but Chazelle is an exciting, talented young director, and the Academy won’t miss this opportunity to reward him.Will win: Damien ChazelleShould win: Barry JenkinsBest Actor in a Leading RoleCasey Affleck had a lock on his Oscar until the very last minute, when Denzel Washington surprised everyone by beating him at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Both men gave incredible performances in their respective films, but the controversy surrounding Affleck’s past sexual assault allegations may finally have turned the tide in Washington’s favor. Considering that Washington gave his best ever performance while directing “Fences,” few could complain about a win for him. That said, our money is on Affleck to power through the backlash and take home gold.Will win: Casey AffleckShould win: Denzel WashingtonBest Actress in a Leading RoleThe Best Actress category is overflowing with talent this year, from Natalie Portman in “Jackie” to Ruth Negga in “Loving.” While Meryl Streep should be happy just to sit back and enjoy her 20th nomination, we can’t say the same for her French counterpart. Isabelle Huppert recieved her first ever Oscar nomination this year for “Elle,” and a win for the delightful French actress would please even the stodgiest of critics. Even so, Emma Stone has dominated awards season so far, and will almost certainly do the same on Oscars night.Will win: Emma StoneShould win: Isabelle HuppertBest Actor in a Supporting RoleIt’s Mahershala Ali’s world, and we’re all just living in it. Not only did Ali give a painfully real performance as drug-dealer Juan in “Moonlight,” but he blessed us with his presence in “Hidden Figures” as well. There’s no way he doesn’t win his first Oscar this year — the other Supporting Actor contenders have surely accepted it by now, and so should we.Will win: Mahershala AliShould win: Mahershala AliBest Actress in a Supporting RoleShould the other nominees even bother to show up? Viola Davis has had this category locked down for months. Our only regret is that she’s nominated in the supporting category, when her role in “Fences” was clearly a lead. But hey, any Oscar for Viola is better than an Oscar for anyone else.Will win: Viola DavisShould win: Viola Davis',\n",

       "  'body': 'One of the first columns I ever wrote at the Indiana Daily Student was about Cuddlr, an app designed for strangers to meet up and cuddle. Back then I described it as “the perfect treasure map for rapists and kidnappers.”Stranger danger isn’t simply a funny looking man that approaches a third grader in a supermarket. Because of social media, strangers are everywhere, and most of us can easily say that we’re friends with a few on Facebook, or are followed by some on Twitter.But also, in my naïve sophomoric mind, I was joking. Throughout the column I made jabs at the app and said it was “designed to be nonspecific, gender-neutral, age-neglecting and non-psychopath-detecting.” I asked questions like, “What if the person you meet up to cuddle with smelled bad?” and explained that there was no scratch and sniff button.The IDS reported Thursday that four men, two of whom are IU students, were arrested on charges of child molestation. A 13-year-old girl met each man through an app called Whisper.Much like Cuddlr, this app prides itself on anonymity and uses people’s location to connect you with individuals in their area. Although I don’t fancy walking head-on into a child molester’s safe haven, I decided to download Whisper to see what it was like.Immediately upon opening it, a silent video pops up — “Read people’s minds,” it says. Then it goes on to explain who these “people” may be — friends, strangers, classmates, lovers, coworkers, neighbors, everyone.According to the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office, “Whisper stores content posted for public viewing; however, once users start to chat with each other, that data is not public content, and Whisper does not keep a record of those conversations.”You’re asked to turn on your location to see what people are whispering. I clicked “Nearby” to see what people were posting in Bloomington.Scrolling through, a lot of the posts were standard Tinder-esque messages. “Just wish I had a beautiful girl to spoil,” “Someone come hanky panky with meee,” “Netflix and chill with your boy?”Some users indicated what gender and age they were — “M21 haven’t had a sleepover in a while.”Most importantly, most of the messages were not safe for work and definitely not safe for the eyes of a 13-year-old.A user named “some girl” posted, “Any IU Bloomington guy wanna talk? I’m 16 I’m just so done with guys in my grade actin like they 10 it ain’t gon take me anywhere in life just will hold me back.”Now before you jump the gun, it’s not “some girl’s” fault for posting this. We grow up watching shows like “16 and Pregnant,” and we don’t blink an eye when we see 16 year-old Kylie Jenner date 24 year-old Tyga. It’s society’s fault. It’s her parents’ as well for letting her have access to an app like this.“Totally know a guy that got arrested for hooking up with a minor on here,” followed by three emojis — the face with tears of joy.Someone asked this individual, “Were you the minor?” and Mille, the user that initially posted, replied, “Nope, I’m not that stupid.”BuzzFeed published a piece in 2014 that talked about how Whisper allows survivors of sexual assault to remain anonymous and confess things ranging from childhood abuse to workplace misconduct.Obviously they didn’t know a 13-year-old girl would be molested by app users two-and-a-half years later, but the imminent dangers of anonymous digital communities are oftentimes overlooked.All social networking apps come with positive and negative sides but there comes a point in time when you have to ask whether an app like Whisper is doing more harm than good.jlkarl@umail.iu.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The show began with a dancing deer, a talent scout and a spoken-word poem about the dangers of college students. Performers then broke out into song about an interspecies love affair between a frog and mouse.The performance was part of “Love Songs for a Lasting World” on Monday at Buskirk-Chumley Theater. The event involved music, short skits and dance and supported the Middle Way House.Donna Storm, Middle Way House triage specialist, said the focus of the event was love that goes beyond the romantic love that many focus on around Valentine’s Day.“The event is about love for your friends and family and everyone around you,” she said.Storm said this message fits along well with the mission of Middle Way House, which serves as a domestic violence shelter and sexual assault crisis center.“Middle Way House is all about love and compassion and empathy,” she said. “It’s a celebration of love and community.”Middle Way House volunteer Abby Mencl said the songs performed during the event are directly related to the people the Middle Way House is trying to serve.“All those songs of love, I think, are meant to go out to those victims of sexual assault,” Mencl said. “It’s this whole message of love or people who need it most.”The benefit event was an opportunity to raise awareness for the efforts of Middle Way House, Storm said. In doing so, it pushes domestic violence into the forefront of the community’s attention and prevents victims from feeling invisible.Attendee Alan Backler said this mission of empathy for victims of violence is what attracted him to attend the event.“We always have to support organizations in our community that stress compassion for all of its members,” he said. “That’s our responsibility to serve these people.”Backler said the event not only emphasizes love for those in need but also the unconditional love of parents.“The song ‘Unconditional Love’ really stood out to me because it speaks to that love between a parent and a child that often gets overlooked by those who immediately think of romantic love,” Backler said.Middle Way House volunteer Christopher De Young said his favorite part of the event was the music. While he enjoyed the songs related to unconditional love, the songs he said stood out to him most were those related to a love for the environment.“There’s this environmental message in a lot of the songs that I think is very important in this day and age,” De Young said. “A love for the environment is important, but not many people really think about it.”De Young said the event’s overall message of love is vital to communities, especially today.“It shows that love conquers hate, and we’re living in an environment where it’s easy to forget that,” he said.',\n",

Skirvin said sexual assault is also prevalent in residence halls and occurs in off-campus housing.“While sexual assault is common on college campuses nationwide, there is evidence that suggests sexual assault is more prevalent in the greek community,” Skirvin said.According to the National Institute of Justice sorority membership is a “risk factor” for sexual assault, With this understanding, IU has put in place specific sexual assault services for greeks like Safe Sisters.A “Safe Sister” is a greek woman who is knowledgable and available to assist her sorority sisters in issues regarding sexual assault prevention and prosecution.“Safe Sisters was created by the Sexual Assault Crisis Service in collaboration with the Panhellenic Council to provide training, resources, education and support to women in the greek community about sexual assault,” Skirvin said.The Panhellenic Association oversees most of the sororities on campus. Skirvin said every Panhellenic Association sorority is tasked with choosing representatives who attend a four-hour tr-aining session and monthly meetings in the fall and spring semesters. The representatives report back to their respective houses consistently.Junior Riley Sobczak is a member of Alpha Gamma Delta and is her house’s representative to Safe Sisters.“Personally, both Safe Sisters and CAPS have helped me with a wide range of complicated situations, and I’m glad to have been at Indiana University while these organizations were present,” she said.Sobczak said Safe Sisters aims to make greek women feel safe and comfortable, and that is important because students are less likely to come forward without a proper prevention infrastructure in place.It’s Sobczak’s job to take her training and meetings seriously since it’s partially her job to inform her sisters of the dangers of sexual assault and the available resources.Skirvin said representatives have to educate themselves and their houses regarding options for counseling, medical care, reporting and academic assistance for survivors of sexual trauma.Although IU has established organizations like Safe Sisters, Sobczak said more members of the greek community need to get involved, but she said their involvement should not be mandated.Mandatory attendance never results in more awareness in the community, she said.Instead, she recommended having more events related to sexual assault to encourage awareness in the community.Skirvin also said IU could continue to better itself. She urged IU to remain vigilant regarding the safety of its students. She said the University should assess and invest in any policies or improvements that help to keep students safe.The University does have specific programs in place to combat sexual assault, however. Some of these programs include Culture of Care the ItsOnUs campaign, Step Up IU!, Last Friday Night and others.Despite this, Skirvin said the University should take student safety concerns and feedback seriously and monitor and ensure faculty and staff interact with students appropriately in order to educate students about their rights.“IU can continue to explore ways to ensure the safety of all of its students and is obligated to hold accountable any organizations or individuals who have caused harm to students due to sexually inappropriate behavior,” Skirvin said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Residence Hall Association elections and mold at McNutt were topics of conversation at the RHA association meeting Wednesday. The conversation among the RHA student leaders was mostly about the betterment of student life at the IU residence halls.RHA President Anne-Therese Ryan said the attendees should stand up on behalf of students who may feel ostracized by new legislation preventing immigration to the United States from Muslim-majority countries.“Please just watch out for those students who might need some extra help and maybe some more positive vibes in their life,” Ryan said.IU Residence Hall Association members were encouraged to refer these students to CAPS and spread the word that fees are waived for students affected by the immigration executive order.Director of IU Counseling and Psychological Services Nancy Stockton, Ph.D. confirmed that CAPS is providing free counseling sessions for those who have been directly affected by the president’s new immigration order.Stockton said emergency counseling slots have been set aside specifically for anyone from countries restricted by the ban in order to accommodate them quickly. Also, free workshops to help people cope with the stress of the current immigration situation are beginning Feb 9 and will be held at the IU Health Center on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4 p.m.Stockton said CAPS has counselors who speak foreign languages like Mandarin and Spanish.Stockton said she thinks it would be beneficial to hire a counselor who speaks Arabic or other popular student languages. Until then, whenever there aren’t any counselors who speak the language of a patient uncomfortable with their English, a translator can be arranged for the patient’s counseling session.Stressed students can always receive help from the 24-hour CAPS crisis line at 812-855-5711. CAPS also provides free stress management workshops, webinars, and mindfulness group events on a weekly basis for students, Stockton said.Additionally, students can visit counselors at the Office of International Studies.There has been an increase in people using CAPS recently, and though it is impossible to tell why, Stockton said the immigration rule has in fact been a source of stress some patients lately.The recent RHA meeting not only discussed student resources like CAPS but also events and activities occurring all around campus and in the residence halls for the benefit of students.RHA Vice President of Internal Affairs Dakota Coates said IU student government wants to partner with RHA and that one of the new ideas IUSA said they want to see implemented is the creation of new voting sites for federal and state government elections.Each center president discussed this semester’s upcoming events. Ashton Center, Eigenmann Hall, Forest Quad, Spruce Hall, Union Street Apartments and Willkie Quad representatives said they will be having Super Bowl parties this Sunday. The center presidents proposed a variety of party ideas separating their quad’s party from the others, such as Baked! cookies, Buffa Louie’s wings and poker games.A speaker from the Netflix documentary “Audrey & Daisy” will be coming to IU after Little 500 to discuss sexual assault with students, one representative announced.Another representative reported the Wells Quad will have about 170 beds and to potentially house the Women in Science, Technology, Informatics and Mathematics Living Learning Center. She also said Wright will soon be renovated with the creation of pod bathrooms and renovation of the lounge areas.The Student Health Committee will be focusing on student sexual health this semester, Coates said. He said he is hoping to get a health center representative on the committee to show members of RHA how to use safe sex resources so they can do the same presentation for students at the residences halls.“If we’re fighting for access to safe sex resources, then we all need to know exactly what it is we’re fighting for, or what it is we’re wanting to get for students,” Coates said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Roxane Gay talked Twitter, Trump and Tatum at her speaking engagement Wednesday night in President’s Hall.Gay read two excerpts from her recent work, “Difficult Women,” an anthology about women who face sexual assault, infidelity and grief, and answered audience questions about current politics, her upcoming work, writing for screen and comics, and feminism — both its good and bad sides.Most of the time was spent in a question-and-answer portion, where Gay fielded questions about political action and her avowed love for Channing Tatum.On Wednesday news broke that Gay, 42, had pulled her forthcoming book, “How to Be Heard,” from her deal with publisher Simon & Schuster, according to BuzzFeed News.The book publisher had previously made a deal to publish Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos’ novel after he was banned from Twitter for orchestrating a racist harassment campaign against “Ghostbusters” star Leslie Jones.“I just couldn’t sleep at night thinking, ‘They’re just going to give him a platform for hate?’” Gay said. “I felt like that was a stand I could take to say, ‘We’re not going to normalize racism.’”Gay told the audience that Yiannopoulos’ advance, $250,000, exceeded the advances for her first five books.Anna Cabe, a graduate student in the English department, asked Gay how she manages the online harassment she receives.Her answer was to ignore it, mute it or fire back.Cabe said Gay’s answer was candid and fulfilled her expectations of the author.“There’s something kind of new about this age where you can talk to people across the world,” Cabe said. “It opens you up to a torrent of really terrible things that I think our current president has legitimized.”Kyle Polster, a freshman at IU, said he arrived at Franklin Hall at about 4:30 p.m. to ensure he’d get a seat.The doors opened at 6:10 p.m. instead of the projected 6:30 p.m. after the line across the hallway in front of President’s Hall had already gone around the corner.Polster, who has read Gay’s work since his freshman year in high school, said he’s studied her work extensively and watched her TED talk, “Confessions of a Bad Feminist.”“I’ve probably written about eight papers on her, but there’s something about seeing her in person,” Polster said. “Just holistically, I love how brutally honest she is. She’s wholeheartedly herself. She embraces herself thoroughly.”Cabe said Gay’s lecture tapped into themes of race and gender that Cabe deals with on a daily basis.“As a woman of color and as a writer, I admire the way she conducts herself,” Cabe said. “It was really important for me to see her tonight ... She’s a model I might want to follow for myself.”Gay’s readers can follow that model from her previously published “Bad Feminist,” a collection of essays; a novel, “An Untamed State”; and many other pieces of literary fiction and nonfiction. Her upcoming book, “Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body” hits shelves June 13.This past year Gay made history with poet Yoana Harvey as the first black women to write for Marvel Comics.The series, “World of Wakanda,” follows a legion of all-female guards who serve the Black Panther’s royal family.While some students asked questions about Gay’s many works, other questioners sought advice or context for the election and inauguration of President Trump.Gay said it’s not necessarily the left’s job to reach out to Trump supporters but to keep an eye on local politics, vote whenever possible and wait for some of Trump’s promises about business and the job market to fall through.“I’m, as with everyone, trying to figure out the next step,” she said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Questions about what it means to be cisgender, monogamous and abused were plucked from the jar and discussed at length. Hands at each table reached out to grab the little glass jars with white pieces of paper in them. Individuals slowly opened their selection, looked down and read the question aloud, but not everyone knew the answer.“Black Love, Sex and Everything else” took place at 6 p.m. Wednesday in the Neal-Marshall Grand Hall. Students and professors gathered to discuss love, sex and racial issues.Mostly African American students and faculty filled the room. Food like Baked! of Bloomington cookies were available to lighten the mood and get people talking. Each of the round tables had a black cover, clear jars with discussion topics in them and raised flashcards that read “Fact vs. Myth” in red and black.Kristen Petty, junior and undergraduate staff at Neal-Marshall, was one of the two event organizers. She was supported by event volunteers.“I started working here the beginning of the school year,” Petty said. “This is really the biggest event I’ve been allowed to put a lot of input in.”For Petty Neal-Marshall is like a home away from home.“With the stress of school you always want to be around people that look like you and go through the same struggles,” she said. “At the end of the day you just want a sense of belonging.”The inspiration for the event came about after semesters of students visiting the black culture center and talking about their sexual knowledge, myths and consent.Petty said with Valentine’s Day right around the corner it is always best to have conversations about safe sex.Not all the attendants were frequent visitors to Neal-Marshall as Petty. Sophomore Tyshaonae Hamilton said she doesn’t come to Neal-Marshall as often as she would like. However, Hamilton said there was something special about this event.“The topic of the event seemed really interesting,” she said. “I like how it’s a discussion based event that lets you listen to people’s ideas.”The discussion groups allowed people to see and hear everyone at their table , which allowed conversation to flow. This was done on purpose because Petty said it’s up to organizations and individuals to open the way for discussions.The round tables also served Hamilton well because she said she was interested in hearing people talk about issues that aren’t always easy to talk about.Deveny Rhem, a junior, was one of the most talkative people at her table.. She said she visits Neal-Marshall about three times a week because it’s her favorite place to study.“Freshman year I didn’t know much about the place, then I had to do a project about it my sophomore year,” Rhem said. “Then I realized how awesome it was and started taking advantage.”The advantages of Neal-Marshall go beyond a comfortable work environment, Petty said. Organizers of groups like the Community Capacity for Prevention & Education, wanted to provide as many resources as possible.“We have the IU CAPS, sexual assault counseling services, LQBTQ+ Cultural Center, CCPE, and the School of Public Health,” Petty said.The different organizations gathered at various sections of the hall, distinguished by their display table, tri-folds or flyers. Ann Skirvin and a few assistants represented IU’s Counseling and Psychological services who were invited by one of the organizers.“We were invited here and are very happy to be here to support Mohammed, one of the liaisons to this event,” Skirvin said. “I think it’s a great idea for a event to be talking about sex, love and everything in between.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Despite a rainy evening and the looming unease of Friday’s inauguration, the Bloomington community came together to celebrate the presidency of Barack Obama and raise money for Middle Way House.Last night, the Root Cellar had a “Last Night of Obama” benefit show in honor of the local rape crisis center Middle Way House.The evening featured music from local artists Nice Try, Full Sun and Bugg. Underneath the ground floor of Farm, dancing beneath the glow of Christmas lights and vintage Victorian furniture, the event aimed to unite Bloomington residents in a love for music and support.Students and community members came together to unite and show their opposition for incoming President Donald Trump and his history of lewd comments about sexual assault.Organizing the event is former legal advocate for Middle Way Bella Bravo.Since leaving Middle Way, Bravo has been trying to find ways to continue to contribute to their mission, she says.With concerns that sexual assault and rape culture will become even more normalized after Trump’s inauguration, Bravo said she wanted to amplify the voices of the women who have come forward with their stories of being sexually assaulted by Trump.“Election Day really kicked my butt, to say the least,” Bravo said. “I decided that I needed to do something so these women’s real and important experiences didn’t fade into the background post-election. Since the election, I’ve adopted ‘this should not be normal’ as my mantra. While I think sexual assault is all too common, we shouldn’t have to live in a culture that accepts it as normal.”In addition to featuring local musicians, the show also featured animations accompaniments from Hadley Gephart, Sarah Dunevant, Janelle Beasley and Miles Grimmer.The show-goers were able to enjoy live music from local musicians, donate to Middle Way House and get information on how to volunteer and become active in fighting against sexual assault over the next four years.This act of community empowerment and activism is just one of multiple events happening around Bloomington this weekend in response to Friday’s inauguration. Student and community organizations across the city organized day-long celebrations of community activism, teach-ins and workshops, marches, rallies and free musical performances at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater.For those interested in becoming a volunteer with Middle Way House, the next volunteer training session will take place from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday in the Downtown Transit Center.Community organizations like Middle Way are hoping events like these can help unite the community during a time when many need it most.“I think Middle Way House is also a supportive community for anyone,” Bravo said. “Whatever age, gender, race, religion who is interested in figuring out ways to change harmful social norms.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Anyone who knows me understands how much I admire and respect Vice President Joe Biden.From the Biden and outgoing President Obama memes that sprang up after the election to his support of blue-collar families and manufacturing jobs, the vice president is nothing short of a class act.When he made tackling sexual assault on college campuses one of his key points in the last term, that admiration solidified.While I did not approve of everything the Obama administration did during the last eight years, I admired that it, and in particular the vice president, brought sexual assault to the forefront of national politics.Biden spearheaded the “1 is 2 Many” initiative, the goal of which is to reduce date rape among young adults. This is an admirable goal and something I had hoped the Trump administration would continue.That hope is quietly dying out now due to the confirmation hearing of the nominated secretary of education, Betsy DeVos.Her lack of comments on what she will do to combat sexual assault on college campuses is worrying and could have significant influence on how sexual assault is dealt with in the upcoming years.A 2014 study by the White House revealed troubling statistics about sexual assault.One in five women will be raped at some point in her life, and almost half of these rapes occur by the age of 18.More than half the assailants knew the victim, and 98 percent of assailants were male.While the numbers were staggeringly high across the board for all racial groups, multiracial women and Native American women suffered from higher percentages of rape.As the Trump administration gets ready for the next four years, it needs to have a comprehensive way to attack this problem.So far, we are a long way from any solution we could even call workable.DeVos claimed she could not commit to carrying out the “1 is 2 Many” initiative. I would like to hear her own suggestion to prevent rape if she does not believe that this method was the right one.Her contributions to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education make me even more wary because the foundation is suing the administration over this very initiative and saying makes it easier for false rape accusations.Considering the fact that less than between 2 and 8 percent of rape victims lie about being attacked, this lawsuit may not have the most merit.I’m not qualified to comment on Mrs. DeVos’ charter school policy or her political contributions.I can, however, say this lack of energy and initiative is appalling.Rape is a crime that can lead to various mental health illnesses, personal problems and suicide.Let’s at least address it.npatwari@umail.iu.edu',\n",

       "  'body': 'The journey to becoming one of two directors for Men Against Rape or Sexual assault started with a realization for Will McElhaney.It was a realization that came after a close friend revealed she had been recently sexually assaulted.McElhaney listened to her story, internalized the message and went to talk to the president of his chapter, Kappa Delta Rho, about what he could do.MARS provides sexual assault prevention training and discussion sessions to fraternities and their members.The goal is to have a civil and educational discussion session where greek men can talk about the misconceptions, questions or general concerns they have about sexual assault prevention.McElhaney said he was enticed by the comprehensive MARS program and how it opened his eyes to the magnitude of the problem.“I met the organizers, had an interview and got involved,” he said.McElhaney, a freshman at the time, said it took him a few days to apply at MARS after meeting its members. It would be another two weeks until he would get the job.After being behind the scenes for a couple of years, McElhaney and his co-director will have the ability to put forward their goals. McElhaney said he intends to continue the fight against sexual assault.“I want to keep letting people know the options, like consent, and spread awareness about how to go forward filing a complaint,” he said.MARS emphasizes preventing sexual violence rather than reactionary solutions.That is why MARS mandated each chapter send 15 percent of its incoming pledge class to a training session starting fall 2016.McElhaney said the intention of the mandate is the few members attending will learn a lot and take the lessons back to their respective chapters. The lessons primarily focus on bystander recognition and prevention.“If you have people in bystander prevention at your event they can identify risky situations,” McElhaney said. “It keeps people safe.”IU’s Interfraternity Council is on board with the mandate.Jack Polte, the vice president of IFC’s Board of Standards, said he fully supports MARS.“To us MARS is a valuable resource to the greek community and the education of young men around the matters of sexual violence,” Polte said.McElhaney and Polte sought to emphasize that sexual assault doesn’t benefit anyone and therefore, needs to be tackled head on.“The concerns of sexual assault are a national issue and our campus is fortunate enough to have a program like MARS and dedicated professionals to continue the education of young men on ways to combat sexual violence,” Polte said.McElhaney said IU could do more to prevent cases of sexual assault, but he did point out that IU’s greek community has fewer sexual assaults than the national average.However, he said simply being below average is not good enough because there are still dozens of cases every semester at IU.McElhaney said MARS aims to let people know that they’re not alone.However, he did address the issue of growing rates of reported sexual assaults on campus, and nationwide. He said each community has its own reasons but there is a growing trend.“A lot of people don’t know that the amount disclosing is actually going up,” McElhaney said.He agreed with Polte about the efficacy of conversations taking place at organizations like MARS.He said the work it continues to do helps prevent sexual violence in the greek community.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Zerlina Maxwell has been a notable figure for many reasons. She worked as director of progressive media for Hillary Clinton during the most recent presidential election, and is also a political activist raising issues in race, domestic violence, sexual assault and gender inequality.On Tuesday evening Maxwell visited the Indiana Memorial Union to talk about these issues.“We want to make sure to reach all students,” said Sarah Cramer, sexual assault prevention education specialist at IU. “This is an effort to be mindful of those who might otherwise be left out.”As a result, it is no accident the event took place during Martin Luther King Jr. week. The talk was intentionally planned with the African American Coalition to join professors, faculty and staff in an effort to prevent sexual assault, Cramer said.“I love that people on campus want to address this,” said Rory James, director of the office of student diversity and inclusion. “This way we can get a feel for what sexual assault prevention is like.”James introduced Maxwell to the hushed chatter of a room of students, parents, professors and staff in the Whittenberger Auditorium.“I try to make my talks entertaining and a little bit lighter because the topic is so heavy,” Maxwell said as she began her talk. “My goal is to help you to identify rape culture in everyday things so you can call it out and prevent its perpetuation.”Maxwell prefaced her speech by sharing how she chooses to frame her sexual assault conversations. She said people need to talk about consent.She said everyone knows rape is wrong, but many do not know what consent is.“Some believe consent is a blurred line, like the song. They think you do not have to ask for consent — you can just tell,” Maxwell said. “I do not frame my conversations with men as the perpetrators because women are not the only ones affected.”One in 33 men experience sexual assault in their lifetimes, Maxwell said, citing a statistic from a report by the United Nations in her presentation.Survey results from the Association of American Universities show one in four women experience sexual assault during college. Bloomington has many resources, including Middle Way House, IU Sexual Assault Crisis Services and Culture of Care, for victims.Though sexual assault prevention frequently discusses methods for women to avoid rape and sexual assault, Maxwell said her goal is to prevent rape before it happens.Throughout her presentation Maxwell cited instances where social media, news reporters and advertisements perpetuated rape culture. She discussed ways to avoid blaming victims by rephrasing the way sexual assault is discussed and asked listeners to be empathetic.“Rather than saying ‘Are you sure? It seemed like you were asking for it — you were wearing a short skirt,’ offer to connect them with support services,” Maxwell said. “Even if you don’t believe them, it might be a bigger situation than you can deal with. Just try to be empathetic.”Cramer said she hoped students would walk away with thoughtful questions about sexual assault. She said it’s important people pay attention because it shows people care and everyone, especially victims, needs to know people care and there are people who can help.“No one can prevent their own rape,” said Maxwell. “The perpetrator is the one who chose to do it. There is nothing the victim can do to prevent being raped.”Maxwell’s primary themes during her speech were to believe survivors, to support survivors, to be a vocal ally, to be an active bystander and always to ask for consent.“Default to believing. Default to empathy,” Maxwell said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Donald Trump will officially become president of the United States on Friday, and for one reason or another, there will be many people for whom his inauguration will be a thing of joy.Having watched their candidate rise to victory, those who took issue with what they viewed as the liberal agenda of identity politics likely now feel validated. These voters will, however, need to share blame if Trump’s policies disenfranchise groups of people.They chose a man who they felt could speak plainly and truthfully about American culture, and Trump’s supporters now feel they’ve taken a stand against elitists on the other side of the political spectrum who dared to insult them with negative social labels.Among the many profiles of Trump voters various news organizations have published in an effort to illustrate these voters’ reasoning, a common thread of indignation at all of the so-called -ist labels emerges. People who voted for Trump don’t like being called sexists or racists primarily because they don’t believe they deserve to be described as such.Maybe they’re right. Many of them are decent people who argued that because no candidate is perfect, they could permit themselves to overlook whatever they found unappealing about the president-elect and choose him instead of a supposedly even less appealing alternative.It is precisely that act of overlooking, though, that so many who felt repulsed or marginalized by Trump struggled to understand. Many people couldn’t believe that this man’s indecency and insensitivity hadn’t barred their fellow citizens from supporting him.While it might be possible that the over-lookers would never individually treat women or people of color unjustly, many Americans who rejected Trump still viewed votes for him as a decision to tolerate a man whose administration would perpetuate such unjust treatment.Asking a person who opposed Trump to cease his or her usage of -ist words feels like asking a victim to accommodate an aggressor, yet, branding a person who voted for him with such words can in some ways be reductive.When we decide what to do next, there has been talk of breaking out of social media echo chambers to foster conversations with people who hold different beliefs. Others have suggested that bickering factions should focus on what unites them in order to do work for the country rather than continuing to dig in their heels about what divides them.We should do those things. But what happens if they don’t work? You can’t very well expect that a survivor of sexual assault will smile on the decision of her neighbor to vote for a man who bragged about the power of his privilege to place him above concern for consent.Ultimately, Trump voters will have to accept that they bear some complicit responsibility in the undesirable consequences they assumed they could overlook. The opposition, for its part, will have to reach out to those who would deny negative labels and invite them to support causes that protect what a Trump presidency might harm.Although it is not the responsibility of the disenfranchised to convince the privileged to care, we all have the ability to shape our nation’s future.

       "  'body': 'A Bloomington man is facing charges after he allegedly raped a 19-year-old woman with developmental disabilities.Thomas Pemberton , 54, is charged with rape when the victim is mentally disabled or deficient. Although the incident was reported to police in early August, there was a lengthy police investigation, and a warrant was not issued for Pemberton’s arrest until January 5. Pemberton turned himself in at the Monroe County Jail on January 9. He posted $2,500 bond and was released that day.The assault allegedly occurred July 30 at Pemberton’s home. The woman filmed the assault on her phone. The video shows Pemberton telling her to touch his genitals, moving her hands onto him and having sex with her, according to court documents.“The only thing (the victim) is heard saying on the video is ‘uh-huh’ on two occasions,” according to documents.The woman received a sexual assault examination at the hospital later that day, at which point a report was filed with the Bloomington Police Department. Investigators interviewed her two days later at Susie’s Place, a child advocacy center, “due to her intellectual and developmental disabilities,” according to court documents. In the interview, the woman told investigators the sex had been non-consensual and she had told Pemberton no.When investigators spoke to Pemberton more than two weeks later, he said the woman showed up at his house on a bicycle unexpectedly and wanted to have sex with him. Pemberton said he had known the woman for several years and had spent time alone with her in the past. However, he denied knowing that she had any type of developmental disability, although he acknowledged that she had a speech impediment.He said he didn’t know her phone number, where she lived or even her last name, according to court documents. The woman lives in a group home, doesn’t drive, doesn’t have a job and is under continued supervision, according documents.She has “mild to moderate cognitive deficits and is diagnosed as being disabled,” according to court documents.“(The victim) has poor capacity for self-protective boundaries and does not have the ability to give consent,” according to court documents.Under Indiana law, people with significant developmental disabilities cannot give consent.Pemberton waived his initial hearing. He has a pretrial conference scheduled for March.Taylor Telford',\n",

       "  'body': 'On the first day of classes, Delta Tau Delta was suspended from IU due to multiple accounts of hazing.Delts face a five-year suspension from campus and members of the fraternity are required to move out of their house by the end of January. The house will be available for a different tenant moving forward. The fraternity did not reveal specifics in regards to the hazing incidents.Delts, however, is only one of a handful of fraternities that have encountered disciplinary action over the past two years.According to online university records, Phi Kappa Psi and Sigma Alpha Mu also faced offenses due to hazing. Phi Psi’s suspension involved drug related charges in addition to hazing. The chapter lost their housing privileges, although their house still remains on North Jordan Avenue.The chapter is scheduled to return to campus in the fall of next year, although they will not move back into their house until fall of 2019, according to Adam Weber, Intrafraternity Council vice president of recruitment and former president of the Delta Chi fraternity.While not as common as in fraternities, sororities also face hazing charges. Over the course of the past two years, Alpha Gamma Delta and Sigma Delta Tau have faced disciplinary consequences for hazing activities, according to online records.Both chapters are officially on disciplinary probations, meaning they are under close watch by the university but generally maintain their normal rights and privileges as other chapters do. AGD and SDT are both off probation later this year, according to university records.The records indicate a very common offense that both fraternities and sororities face include alcohol use and situations that generally endanger others. Because fraternities host parties and social events which provide alcohol, it’s more common for them to face repercussions. Sororities, however, have consequences for their behavior at these events, as they are willing participants with specific paired fraternities.IU Police Department Capt. Andy Stephenson said campus police officers have not recently received any criminal complaints related to the Delts incident or from other Greek chapters in general.Jack Polte, IFC vice president of standards, said there are two primary levels of allegations Greek life can experience: individual instances and wrongs of the chapter culture.“Hazing is probably the biggest cultural one,” Polte said. “Sexual assault, rape and alcohol charges can be more individual in certain cases.”Polte said individual cases can be handled a few different ways, including removing the member at fault from the chapter and disaffiliating them from the chapter.“This will show your members that that kind of behavior is not acceptable,” Polte said. “It also shows the university that you’re making strides, you’re taking these things seriously and you’re trying to work on improving your chapter.”Education for members and involvement in campus initiatives are intended to help bring greek organizations back in the clear. Programs such as Counseling and Psychological Services, Culture of Care, and Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault can offer training sessions for these groups, Polte said.“This kind of puts things together so people know what’s expected of them,” he said. “They can teach those kids in a larger setting of how they can handle these situations and how they can make a positive impact on their chapter in the future.”All 30 chapters in IFC are on board with MARS.Polte and Weber said they look forward to IFC working more closely with the IU Panhellenic Association. Greek student leaders of IFC and PHA will be going to a two-day retreat at Bradford Woods together next weekend.',\n",

       "  'body': 'State lawmakers and Indiana’s new governor have laid out their agendas for the 2017 legislative session. The agendas emphasize expanding funds for infrastructure improvements and preschool programs and tackling the drug epidemic. The session began last week.Gov. Eric Holcomb revealed his five-part plan last Thursday. In addition to developing roads and bridges and attacking the drug problem in Indiana, he wants to make the state a magnet for jobs and develop its workforce.This legislative session bills will be brought before a legislature with a Republican majority in both the House and the Senate.Here are some of the issues to watch for this session.A drug prevention directorWhen discussing the drug crisis in the state, Holcomb announced he’d create a new position to tackle the epidemic. Jim McClelland, retired president and CEO of Goodwill Industries of Central Indiana Inc. will be the new executive director for drug prevention, treatment and enforcement.Holcomb said curbing the drug problem is one issue he feels very passionately about, and it saddens him to read news about victims of the epidemic.“If I only had one wish left, it would be that we could change the trajectory,” Holcomb said.Infrastructure fundingState legislators have also highlighted funding for road improvements as a main focal point of the 2017 session.Sen. Luke Kenley, R-Noblesville, said the state will need about $350 million per year to finish its current infrastructure projects and another $500 to $600 million per year in order to upgrade important roads.Indianapolis is within a 24-hour drive of 75 percent of the U.S. population, so it’s important its roads are updated, Kenley said. He said both I-65 from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky, and I-70 from Terre Haute, Indiana, to Richmond, Indiana, should be targets of new funds.Kenley wrote Senate Bill 262, which allows the Indiana finance authority permission to issue bonds or notes for transportation projects, the total amount of which cannot exceed $500 million.Funding Indiana’s Roads for a Stronger Safer Tomorrow Task Force, a legislative committee Kenley belongs to, suggested updating the gas and diesel fuel tax as a way to raise funds. Kenley said tolls may also need to be installed on updated roads once they’re finished.The updated roads will be worth the extra money, Kenley said.“We’ve spent a couple years trying to get ourselves prepared for this,” he said.When outlining infrastructure goals for the legislative session, Holcomb mentioned any method of obtaining revenue is a possibility at this point, but doing nothing isn’t an option.“The only thing that’s off the table, in our mind, is a ‘none of the above’ approach,” Holcomb said. “We have to address this.”Preschool programsHolcomb said he wants to double the state’s investment in pre-kindergarten education.Rep. Robert Behning, R-District 91, wrote House Bill 1330, which changes the eligibility requirements of the state’s On My Way Pre-K program in an attempt to expand it. The program gives grants to low-income families with 4-year-olds to allow them access to higher-quality pre-kindergarten education.The original five counties, Allen, Lake, Marion, Jackson and Vanderburgh, selected for the pilot have done a good job of rolling out the program, said Behning, who is the chair of the House Education committee. Anecdotal evidence shows the program is positively affecting preschoolers, but it’s too soon for data, he said.Regardless, he said it’s important to expand the program throughout the state to whichever counties have interest and capacity.As the bill is developed, Behning said legislators will be able to determine counties where the program can be expanded.The counties chosen will ideally be of varying geographical and overall makeup.“A lot of us truly believe that preschool will make a difference,” Behning said.Continuing abortion restrictionsA bill authored by Rep. Curt Nisly, R-Goshen, would completely outlaw abortion in the state if passed.House Bill 1134, known as the “Protection at Conception” bill, had its first reading Jan. 9 and was referred to the Committee on Public Policy, according to the Indiana General Assembly website.Nisly’s bill would allow discretion of how to charge someone who performs an abortion up to a prosecutor. Hoosiers for Life, an advocacy organization that promotes anti-abortion bills, brought the idea to Nisly and helped him write the legislation.Nisly said he’s been getting positive feedback from Hoosiers around the state about the bill, and other legislators support HB 1134, too. However, House and Senate leaders have balked at promoting the legislation, and Hoosiers for Life founder Amy Schlichter said she’s afraid the general assembly won’t give it the time of day.Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky released a statement in response to the legislation. The organization said it is “appalled at the complete and total lack of empathy that Rep. Nisly has shown Hoosier women by filing an unconstitutional abortion ban bill.”“Government intrusion into our doctors’ offices must end,” said Betty Cockrum, president and CEO of PPINK, in the Jan. 10 release.Raising the age of consentRep. Karlee Macer, D-Indianapolis, has been working on a bill that would raise the age of consent in Indiana from 16 to 18.The goal of the bill is to punish 50- and 60-year-olds taking advantage of teenagers and not to punish or interfere with “young love,” Macer said.The bill, which Macer said would be published on the Indiana General Assembly website soon, would not affect Indiana’s “Romeo and Juliet” law, which allows 14- and 15-year olds to have non-forced sexual activity with someone no more than four years older than them.Macer said the idea for the bill was brought to her by detectives and former attorney general Greg Zoeller. It’s an attempt to reduce instances of human trafficking and sexual assault in the state.“Unfortunately our children are being targeted by pimps, by people who want to take advantage of them,” Macer said. “The last thing I want to do is be in people’s bedrooms, but I do want to protect children.”In addition to raising the age of consent, the bill would also create the criminal offense of “indiscretion,” which would occur if someone at least 23 years old had sex with someone at least 16 but younger than 18.Child seduction would no longer be considered a Level 6 felony, punishable by up to two and a half years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines.“This is an issue that is overwhelming our state right now,” Macer said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The Herman B Wells Library will soon launch the Arts and Humanities Council’s initiative “China Remixed” with the opening of a photographic exhibit.“Above Ground – 40 Moments of Transformation” was originally organized by Chinese feminist Lü Ping and is organized at IU by gender studies doctoral candidate  Jiling Duan. The exhibit will be set up Jan. 10 in the Wells Library’s lobby.The photographs, depicting efforts by feminist activists working in China, are important to Duan for a variety of reasons, she said in an email.“As a Chinese feminist activist myself, I witnessed and participated in some of the feminist activities in China, and reported many of the events included in this exhibit when I was a journalist,” Duan said. “I understand how difficult it is to do something like what the Young Feminist Activism (YFA) did in China.”Duan said she wants feminist friends who are fighting for the causes displayed in these photographs to feel supported.“I want to give to my Chinese feminist friends, especially those who are still under a lot of pressure in China, some of them are even continuously harassed by the government,” Duan said. “I hope this exhibit will be successful, and I sincerely hope that the audience will leave some messages in the guest book.”Michelle Crowe, director of communications for IU Libraries, said the exhibition is made for Wells because the library is the visual center among libraries on campus.“Last year, over 2 million visits were recorded here, making the Wells Library Lobby one of the most heavily used academic spaces at Indiana University,” Crowe said. “Our work is tied closely to the teaching mission of this University, so hosting this exhibition here is an important way we can integrate the global humanities experiences happening on campus.”There are also many reasons why students should pay special attention to this exhibition, Duan said in an email.Not only are many of the activists of college and graduate-school ages, but the issues at play — sexual assault and violence among them — are some that can affect a wide audience, Duan said.The connection to feminism and women’s rights is just the beginning, Duan said in an email. The exhibit opens the door to discovering the truth about gender issues in China.“Since the young feminist adopted the performance art as the major strategy, this exhibit is also of art value,” Duan said in an email. “There are very interesting and exciting images included. You won’t be disappointed.”Duan said all the images are powerful, though some have a special connection to her own life. “Bloody Bride” and “Occupy the Men’s Room,” for example, feature Duan’s friends.“Those two are the very first few events successfully made on the street and drew a lot of attention from the public,” Duan said in an email. “Another one is particularly touching to me because I see the feminist solidarity around the world. Feminists will always carry on, no matter how hard it is.”Support for feminist causes is the main reason why this exhibition is important, Duan said in an email. After the 2014 detainment of feminist activists in China on the eve of International Women’s Day, there was an outpouring of support and solidarity.“I hope it would help strengthen the feminist solidarity and offer a chance for people of the same kind to get together, meet each other, and communicate with each other,” Duan said in an email.',\n",

       "  'body': 'One of the important concerns of every college campus is safety. At IU there are two entities that work specifically to keep students, staff and faculty safe. They are the IU Police Department and the Bloomington Police Department. As a student, however, it can sometimes be hard to differentiate the two.“I always thought of IUPD as excise cops at tailgates,” senior Courtney Holcomb said. “One of the biggest things as a student is knowing the difference between IUPD and Bloomington PD.”BPD has jurisdiction in the greater radius of the town. It is an area of 20 square miles, according to the department’s website.IUPD, however, works within the smaller circle of campus within BPD’s jurisdiction. IUPD has more than 300 employees across all seven IU campuses. The Bloomington division has more than 40 full-time officers that monitor campus activity and emergencies.“We have certain views of what law enforcement is on IU’s campus, and there’s a discrepancy between the two,” Holcomb said.IUPD responds to calls related to most offenses. Some of the most frequently occurring at IU include theft, burglary, drug use and possession, underage drinking or public intoxication, and sexual assault and harassment.IU started its new Culture of Care initiative in 2012. IUPD plays a role in this program by helping victims of sexual assault understand the legal options open to them after an attack.In addition to officers, IUPD offers a student cadet program through which students interested in the field can train and earn accreditation through the University after hands-on training. This kind of program usually lasts for a full year and is open to students of any major.“People make IUPD out to be these fearful figures,” Holcomb said. “But after having a friend in the cadet program, I see that they aren’t out to set us up for failure but instead there for our protection and to make sure our education is our top priority.”While IUPD makes student safety a primary concern, students said they are usually reasonable in a variety of situations.“I think they’re pretty lenient and act like they’ve been through college before,” sophomore Kelly Nelson said. “They know what happens and know when something should be handled legally and when it should be let go.”Junior Edgar Terriquez agrees IUPD generally has fair policies.“IUPD really seems to look after the students’ best interest and not just out to see who they can grab,” Terriquez said.One of the major responsibilities of IUPD comes in the form of monitoring campus and town-wide social events. Some of the most common include sports season tailgates, homecoming week and Little 500.“Above all I think they definitely look for people that might intrude, not necessarily IU students but people who come from other areas in Indiana and other states who might have bad intentions, especially during big events,” Nelson said.Underclassmen and older students alike agree that IUPD handle these larger events and bigger crowds with extra attention.“They do a really good job during events at IU and make sure everyone is safe,” Terriquez said.Holcomb, Nelson and Terriquez agree IUPD does a generally good job being both protectors and friends on campus.“After turning 21, you realize that these figures are necessary,” Holcomb said. “Bloomington is a community of 80,000 people. There’s a lot more going on than we realize.”Some students, however, might appreciate better communication from IUPD, both in the case of an emergency or a threat on campus, to the daily ins and outs of their jobs.“They could possibly improve their communication/relations with the students around them,” Terriquez said. “They could have more interaction as in what they do on campus or what they are doing.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'Middle Way House’s Rise & Shine Daycare recently received recognition from the state of Indiana as a Level 3 Paths to QUALITY facility.The recognition means Middle Way House is providing a higher quality of care for the children they serve, community programs coordinator Debra Morrow said. Middle Way House is a nonprofit organization that serves survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.“Our families that we serve are either in our transitional housing program or in our shelter, and these are families that childcare can be a real challenge for, especially quality childcare,” Morrow said. “To know that we are able to make the parents feel comfortable in knowing that their children are in a safe and well-rounded environment is important.”The Paths to QUALITY system is a childcare rating and improvement system in Indiana. According to its website, it is “a free resource to help families make informed decisions and to help early care and education providers improve the quality of their programs.”The system has four levels. Level 3 means the childcare program uses a planned curriculum to prepare children for kindergarten and serve their developmental needs and creates a safe and supportive environment.The Rise & Shine Daycare program stays conscious of the unique needs of children and families who are living in the organization’s emergency shelter or transitional housing, childcare coordinator Marcella Ettinger said.“Level 3 means we are one of the higher quality programs in Monroe County,” Ettinger said. “There are not many programs that are similar to what we do.”The Level 3 rating makes the program eligible for more funding from grants and other financial sources, Ettinger said. This includes federal funding from the Child Care and Development Fund and Chances and Services for Youth programs.The highest rating in Paths to QUALITY is Level 4, which means the program has achieved national accreditation. Ettinger said Middle Way House will be working toward this next level in the future.One of the biggest barriers to being able to get a job is childcare, Morrow said. Many of the people who come to Middle Way House have been prevented from working because of an abusive relationship, but Rise & Shine Daycare allows them to search for jobs with the knowledge that their children are in a safe place.The children who come from homes with domestic violence have often experienced trauma, and the staff at Middle Way House works to addresses these difficult issues, Morrow said.“What I appreciate so much is that our staff has an understanding of how trauma affects children and is able to work with them in a very positive way,” Morrow said.Rise & Shine Daycare offers low-cost childcare to remain affordable for these families, Ettinger said.“They are moving out of their home, starting new jobs, coming to different cities,” Ettinger said. “It’s really important that we provide services for low costs to help support them and allow them to save up money so they can get back on their feet.”Ettinger said the most rewarding part about working for Rise & Shine Daycare is seeing how far the families have come.Often the families that come to Middle Way House have uprooted their entire lives, she said.“Watching them grow and develop is just the most incredible thing,” Ettinger said. “For both the kids and the moms, being able to support and encourage them and watch that happen is absolutely incredible.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'A change in venue was requested Thursday for the trial of a former IU ballet teacher accused of sexually assaulting multiple students.Guoping Wang, 54, has pleaded not guilty to charges of sexual battery and criminal confinement. Wang had worked as a dance coach and lecturer with the Jacobs School of Music until he was fired in May.The request for change of venue was rooted in concerns about finding fair jurors, Wang’s attorney, Katharine Liell, said.Liell told Judge Marc Kellams Wang received a great deal of negative media coverage in the past few months. Some of the coverage contained questionable information, including the personal opinion of the detective investigating the case.“The motion is essentially an effort to preserve Mr. Wang’s rights,” Liell said in an interview with the Indiana Daily Student. “That way, if necessary, we can move the trial out of the county and select jurors that aren’t predisposed both ways — to his guilt or his innocence.Another pretrial conference has been set for 2 p.m. March 1, but after the hearing, Liell seemed skeptical the case would reach trial at all.If the case goes to trial, it wouldn’t be until late 2017, Liell said.The first reports of sexual assault came from a ballet student who was training with Wang for “The Nutcracker” in November 2015. Wang asked the student to stay late after a rehearsal and invited her to his office to practice stretches, according to court documents.During one stretch, which involved the student lying on the floor, Wang tried to kiss her. She pushed him away and tried to leave, but Wang blocked her. He shut the door to his office, turned off the lights and began to kiss her again.The student felt frozen as Wang pulled at her leotard and touched her breasts and genitals, according to court documents.“Please, Guoping, no,” the student said. “This can’t happen.”He told her to let him kiss her. The student struggled and tried to cover herself, but Wang pulled off her leotard and tights. He only stopped when there was a noise that sounded like someone walking down the hallway outside the office, according to court documents.When Wang got up to look out the door, the student redressed and walked past Wang to leave. As she left Wang told her not to tell anyone what had happened.The student told her roommate about the incident but didn’t report to the University until March after the spring ballet concluded. Wang continued to work with her and other students until then.When the student reported what had happened to her, the University launched its own investigation into Wang. In the course of the investigation, six others came forward with allegations against Wang.The University waited until it had concluded its investigation — six weeks after the first student made her report — to go to campus police.It cited Title IX policies for the delay, but the policies in no way prohibit the University from immediately contacting law enforcement.Wang was arrested in July. He’s been out of jail on bond since then.Before he came to IU, Wang danced with the Shanghai Ballet Company and Ballet Chicago.',\n",

       "  'body': \"Title IX is a federal civil rights law enforced by the United States Department of Education that protects people from sex-based discrimination in institutions that receive money from the department, such as public schools and universities, including IU.IU’s policies against “sexual misconduct” include protections against sex-based discrimination. The University defines sexual misconduct as sexual harassment, sexual assault, other forms of sexual violence, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual exploitation, stalking and sex-based discrimination. Because the University incorporates this range of behaviors into one large policy, any such incident can be reported the same way. This also means that when a complaint is filed, the complainant could be alleging anything the University defines as sexual misconduct, from discrimination to assault. Most University employees are considered “responsible employees,” meaning they are responsible to report any University violations they are informed of. All instructors, advisers, coaches, residence hall staff and others are considered responsible employees.If a student wants to talk confidentially about an incident of sexual misconduct, there are Confidential Victim Advocates at the Office of Sexual Violence Prevention and Victim Advocacy located at 506 N. Fess Ave. These trained advocates are available for confidential meetings with any student who has experienced sexual misconduct, whether or not the student wants to report the incident. They can be contacted at cva@indiana.edu or 812-856-2469. Counselors at Counseling and Psychological Services on-campus are also confidential employees, meaning they aren't required to report complaints.There are many ways to file an official sexual misconduct complaint at IU, including via email, phone and in-person communication. Students can report an incident online at stopsexualviolence.iu.edu under the IU- Bloomington section of the “Report an Incident” tab. Reports can also be made via titleix@iu.edu or by contacting the IU-Bloomington Title IX Deputy Coordinator, Libby Spotts, at 812-855-5419.Reporting a sexual misconduct incident to the IU Police Department will also result in a report being filed with the University.

       "  'body': \"IU’s mold struggles, Bill Armstrong Stadium renovations, bicentennial plans and Title IX were major points of discussion during Friday’s Board of Trustees meeting. IU Title IX update shows increase in reports of sexual misconductReports of sexual misconduct on the Bloomington campus increased in the 2017-2018 school year.Emily Springston, director of IU's Office of Institutional Equity, said there were 228 reports of sexual misconduct at IU Bloomington and half of those reports were categorized as sexual assault. In 2016-2017, there were only 164 reports of sexual misconduct, according to the Office of Student Welfare and Title IX annual report. Springston told the trustees there may be a change coming to IU’s sexual assault procedures following the Department of Education’s proposed Title IX changes. A big change, she said, would be allowing attorneys to cross examine parties during the hearing process. These changes have not yet been made final. Full-Scale Renovations of Foster, McNutt quads The IU Board of Trustees voted to accelerate the complete renovations of Foster and McNutt residence halls during their meeting Friday.Both residence halls will be closed for the 2019-2020 academic year but expect to reopen for the 2020-2021 academic year.The trustees previously approved the renovations for 2021-2022 and 2023-2024 school years in their February meeting as part of a multi-year plan. They voted Friday for the acceleration of the $56 million construction plans, which would begin May 2019. Provost Lauren Robel said despite IU’s extensive efforts to remediate mold in these buildings, the only way to completely eliminate it is through a full-scale renovation.Over winter break, all rooms in Teter Quad will be cleaned and air samples will be taken, said John Applegate, executive vice president for university academic affairs. There were a few reports of mold in this residence hall, although not as many as in Foster and McNutt. These renovations are part of IU’s plan to invest a total of $300 million in student housing over the next six years.Bill Armstrong Stadium to receive new north grandstand A request to replace the north grandstands at Bill Armstrong Stadium was unanimously approved by the trustees. The existing grandstand facility, which opened in 1983, will be demolished and replaced by a two-story structure for the IU Men’s and Women’s soccer teams and Little 500 bicycle race. The facility will have locker rooms, a lobby, a team room, a warm up room, coaches offices, bicycle support space, conference rooms and public restrooms.Construction on the $7 million project will begin this summer and be completed by June 2020. The project will be funded through private gifts.Bicentennial project updatesIU Bicentennial director Kelly Kish announced the creation of art projects for the bicentennial year, including murals in Wright Quad and President’s Hall.The Wright Quad mural will be created by Caleb Weintraub, an associate professor of painting in the IU School of Art & Design. Kish said the new mural will depict the history of IU from 1998-2020, featuring the campus’ most significant historical moments. The murals in Wright Quad currently depict IU’s history up to 1998. Murals in Presidents Hall will be created by Bonnie Sklarski, a professor emerita in the IU School of Art & Design. The work will feature two paintings representing the IU motto, “Lux et Veritas,” meaning light and truth. The next IU Board of Trustees meeting is scheduled for Jan. 31 to Feb. 1 in Columbus, Indiana. \",\n",

       "  'body': \"A man with a long criminal history in Indiana, including Bloomington, was arrested in San Diego last month for an alleged sexual assault. He pleaded not guilty to the charge Nov. 20, but could be sentenced to up to 21 years in prison if convicted.Gary Cushinberry, 51, was accused of attacking a 26-year-old woman on the street late at night and sexually assaulting her in nearby bushes before fleeing. His criminal history in Monroe County includes at least seven convictions for crimes such as battery and sexual battery. The San Diego District Attorney’s office requested records in Jan. 2014 from a 1995 Monroe County case in which Cushinberry was charged with rape. As part of a plea deal, Cushinberry pleaded guilty to sexual battery.Bloomington residents might know Cushinberry’s name from his past relationship with the former owner of Siam House restaurant, Wemonrat “Wim” Pok. Pok suffered a severe head injury in Oct. 2008 in Fort Wayne, Indiana that forced her to live in a rehabilitation center until her death in 2013. At the time, Pok was in the process of opening another Siam House restaurant there.The night of Pok's injury in 2008, Cushinberry was found leaning over her next to a shattered flower pot when an ambulance arrived to the scene. Fort Wayne Police Department investigators suspected Cushinberry was responsible for her injury but he was never charged. He told Fort Wayne police Pok’s high heel had gotten stuck in a sidewalk grate, causing her to fall backwards and hit her head on the ground. A doctor said Pok’s traumatic injury was not likely caused by a fall, but probably the result of a sudden forceful impact, the Herald-Times reported. “The whole thing was suspicious,”  detective Sandon Quate said at the time.The woman who accused Cushinberry of assaulting her in San Diego testified in open court this week. She said Cushinberry grabbed her from the sidewalk and knocked her down onto a dirty blanket on the ground where he sexually assaulted her. Cushinberry is being held at the George F. Bailey Detention Facility in San Diego. His next court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 19. \",\n",

       "  'body': 'A residential research study promising seven weeks of “FUN!” at Purdue University in 2017 is at the center of a lawsuit alleging multiple incidents of assault, sexual harassment and violence among the 11 to 15-year-old participants. The study, which was marketed to parents as a seven-week summer camp, was shut down the day after a female participant posted a video on social media of another girl nude in the shower area. The lawsuit was filed Oct. 5 by L. Lauderdale on behalf of the minor in the video, who is listed as Jane Doe. The Marion County family named Purdue University, IU, Indiana University School of Medicine and Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute for contributing to the girl’s “substantial emotional trauma.”In 2016, the National Institutes of Health awarded an $8.8 million grant for a five-year period to measure how diet and sodium intake affects blood pressure in adolescents. Titled Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, Camp DASH did not make it through its first summer.The onslaught of problems that led to the camp’s premature closure are laid out in a 51-page internal review released in November 2017 by Alysa Rollock, Purdue vice president for ethics and compliance, at the request of Purdue President Mitch Daniels. Rollock concluded the counselors and program organizers were not appropriately trained, did not adequately supervise participants and failed to report incidents in a timely manner. The lead researcher in the study, Connie Weaver, made several false promises to parents and university officials on how the adolescents were overseen, according to the document. A Camp Dash Facebook page advertised sports, science and nutrition classes, arts and crafts and field trips. Parents were told their children would be supervised at all times. Participants would receive free housing at Purdue’s Tarkington Hall and a $750 stipend over two sessions, according to the internal review. The experience campers had that summer did not carry out the advertisement’s cheery promises.  Two boys were arrested and dismissed during the first week of the study, which began June 10. One boy attempted to choke another participant, and the other was in a fight that sent another child to the hospital. Weaver was informed June 20 of multiple reports that a boy participating in the study had sexually harassed and assaulted female campers. The boy was dismissed the following day, but Weaver did not report the incidents to anyone outside the study until after July 5, according to the internal review. That was the deadline the Biomedical Institutional Review Board, which oversees research at Purdue, set for closing the study if another event occurred. “I implore the committee to allow us to take emergency steps to remove a disruptive camper without fear of shutting down the study,” Weaver wrote in a June 20 memo to Biomedical IRB. “I have conducted 11 previous summer research camps; this is the first time, ever, that incidents leading to arrests have occurred.”In the early hours of July 5, a girl reported to a counselor that one of her male peers had inappropriately touched her in the van ride back from a field trip to see Fourth of July fireworks. Weaver, who was in the vehicle, did not report the event to police, but the counselor independently filed reports.By the end of the first three-week session, seven participants were sent home and one chose to leave.The Purdue University Police Department told Purdue officials June 30 that the study posed an “imminent threat to the health and safety of the children” and recommended the study be canceled.The study was allowed to continue if Weaver followed through with several changes she described in an email to university officials. The reports of sexual assault were still unknown to people outside the study. According to Rollock’s report, many of the changes Weaver promised did not materialize. At least nine incidents allegedly took place in the 10 days before the second session was suspended. A head counselor was informed between 10 and 11 p.m. July 18 that a female camper — who had already been sent home for sexual violence and an attempted choking — posted a video on social media of a girl naked in the shower area. Two boys in the study had seen the video. The counselor did not report the incident to police until the following morning. Within two days of police learning of the video, the remaining 46 campers were sent home. Several administrative problems persisted throughout the study. The researchers intended to have 150 participants, but just 78 enrolled when the study began. Witnesses reported that Weaver’s decisions on whether to dismiss participants were influenced by her desire to maintain sufficient enrollment numbers, according to the internal review. In her July 3 email detailing consequences if the University followed through with its initial determination to shut down the study after the first session, Weaver referenced the ramifications for other research projects and future grants should the study close early. “The embarrassment and potential anger by research partners is considerable and has implications for future collaborations,” the email said. Parents were told their children would be supervised at all times and there would be a licensed paramedic or registered nurse on staff. According to the internal review, these claims were not true. During the nighttime, camper to staff ratios were as low as 1-to-20, violating standards from the American Camp Association. Not one person on staff had the necessary background to manage a residential summer camp, according to the internal review. Weaver hired a camp manager who had experience working with children from low socioeconomic backgrounds for the second session.While the IRB mandated online training if the study were to resume for the second session, nearly 13 percent of counselors did not complete it, according to the internal review. The camp manager did not go through the required training until the day the study closed. Four campers returned within the next week so researchers could collect additional data. The rest of the study was canceled.“The questions that were to be answered by the DASH study are tremendously important to the health of our nation’s youth, and our loss of the opportunity to steward this transformative research disappoints us all,” Daniels wrote in an open letter Nov. 28, 2017. Purdue spokesman Tim Doty said the university does not comment on pending litigation, but referred the Indiana Daily Student to the following statement from Purdue:“The university has acknowledged that mistakes were made regarding the operation of the residential camp associated with the study,” according to Purdue’s statement. “It will continue to work in good faith to remedy any adverse impacts sustained as a result of those events.”IU spokesman Chuck Carney said the University’s involvement in Camp Dash was minimal. IU received $47,000 of the $8.8 million NIH grant to fund one person, Tamara Hannon, to help with the initial set-up of the project. Hannon, a pediatrics professor at IU School of Medicine, was responsible for recruiting and screening participants, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit claims Hannon did not properly account for the adolescents’ backgrounds to determine whether they could be a risk to other participants in the study. IU was absent from Purdue’s investigation, but allegedly collaborated with the other defendants in failing to oversee the participants’ safety, according to the complaint. Attorneys representing L. Lauderdale and the defendants declined to comment for this story. The defendants will submit responses to the lawsuit by Dec. 7. ',\n",

       "  'body': 'Christmas radio stations have tall orders to meet, filling 24 hours a day with purely Christmas content for an entire month. Some even start in November. They play obscure songs and repeat classics more times than you can count.But a radio station in Cleveland, Star 102, WDOK-FM, has cut one popular holiday song from its programming. The station will not play “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” this season, a song which has fallen under scrutiny in recent years for promoting rape culture. More stations should follow their lead.When one takes a closer look at the lyrics, they are undeniably troublesome. With lines like “Say what’s in this drink,” “The answer is no” and “At least I’m gonna say that I tried,” the song trivializes some of the most basic principles of consent.Of course, this song was written in 1944, when the standards for what is acceptable to portray in pop culture were quite different. A song with sexist undertones probably did not turn any heads.It is also important to note the way the implications behind the song can change as well. In 1944, when female sexuality was still quite guarded and repressed by the media, the song was most likely read as a tongue-in-cheek example of a woman trying to express her desire to sleep with a man without outright stating it.Whatever the true intentions of the song were meant to be, it does not change the fact that the lyrics express sentiments of rape culture almost exactly.When these attitudes are found in pop culture, they spread. Whether or not we’re conscious of it, we internalize aspects of the media we consume. So when we listen to this song, this way of thinking about consent is normalized in our minds.Even if we recognize it and it upsets us, this mindset becomes closer to normal in our heads.In the age of the #MeToo movement, this song is no longer greeted with the enthusiasm it once was. Banning the song avoids the risk of offending and puts Star 102, WDOK-FM at the head of the curve, as others are likely to follow suit in the coming years.But some are upset by the station’s decision to refrain from playing the song. They deem it \"politically correct culture\" gone too far — just another example of people being eager to be offended. A quick Twitter search for the song shows all kinds of angry responses.This mindset is incredibly disrespectful to survivors of sexual assault. To suggest that someone ought to continue to hear a song that romanticizes this predatory dynamic and could be potentially triggering is impudent.Furthermore, it promotes a culture wherein ignoring “no” and trying to convince others is seen as acceptable, even cute behavior.Impressionable children listen to Christmas music, and if they grow up with the idea that this is acceptable, the results are more problematic than any sort of cultural preservation this song could be worth.While the song may have been a staple of Christmas pop culture, things change. Culture changes. Everything we consider unacceptable in our culture was fine until we decided that it wasn’t. Now is the time to decide that “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” isn’t.The station’s choice is a statement. It’s one that stands with survivors, that hears their voices, and says, “We are with you.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"To leaders from IU Student Government and Culture of Care, sexual assault rules on campus seem ineffective.Sexual misconduct has been a pressing issue for students at IU over the last few years. The University was cleared of five Title IX investigations in February and over the summer, a student publicly accused IU of mishandling her case.Leaders from the IUSG and Culture of Care had long been working to support survivors of sexual assault within existing IU code policy, but they decided it was time for students to become involved in changing the policies.The two organizations came together in mid-September to form the Sexual Misconduct Student Working Group, an assembly of representatives across student organizations such as the It's On Us campaign and the Student Recreational Sports Center with a mission to examine current sexual misconduct policy and create recommendations for the University.“We need to make sure that students aren’t feeling silenced,” said Isabel Mishkin, the IUSG chief of staff and co-leader of the working group. The working group has three main areas of focus. This includes examining existing language and definitions in IU code, finding gaps or inequities in procedures and reviewing the University’s resources for educating students about sexual misconduct, such as the online MyStudentBody class all incoming students must take.Mishkin said the group has identified roughly 15 areas of concern for which it has recommended policy changes. Group members have worked closely with University administration while drafting its recommendations, including IU Title IX coordinator Emily Springston and Leslie Fasone, who is the director of the Office of Sexual Violence Prevention and Victim Advocacy.  “We believe very strongly that the best work is done when you’re including people in these conversations that have the information,” Mishkin said.Leaders still think students need to have a voice in University policymaking. Tom Sweeney, president of Culture of Care and another co-leader of the working group, said it’s important that students advocate for themselves and others.“Students are the ones experiencing the policies, and so it’s important that the policies match the needs of students,” Sweeney said.Becca Townsend, IUSG’s chief of health and wellbeing, said student should be a part of designing procedures since they are the ones who participate in investigations.“If students don’t have any input, how are they going to get the fair trial that they want to see?” Townsend said.The official list of recommendations is expected to be released this winter, although Mishkin said the group plans to notify administrators about some of the recommendations ahead of time, so they could be prepared for the announcement.Both Mishkin and Townsend said the recommendations are used to enact positive changes to IU’s sexual misconduct policies, procedures and student resources.“I hope the student working group brings a voice to everyone that needs it,” Townsend said.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced changes to the rules governing student sexual assault cases earlier this month. The multitude of new regulations may introduce cross-examination into investigations conducted by colleges and universities.“I definitely think they’re a step in the right direction,” Bloomington attorney Amelia Lahn said. The amendments proposed by the U.S. Department of Education will serve as federal guidelines for the way all colleges and universities handle cases of sexual assault on their campuses.Other changes under consideration with the proposal include a stricter definition of sexual assault, live hearings and a decrease in liability for universities.Under the previous regulations, Lahn said questions between the accuser and accused were required to be submitted in writing to the hearing board first, as opposed to the parties being able to question each other directly.  Under the new proposal, both the accused and accuser in the case would be allowed to cross-examine each other directly through an adviser, such as a lawyer or victim advocate.Lahn said this addition makes big strides in balancing out the rights of the victims and the accused in these cases. “From the respondents' point of view, I just think this is invaluable because it gives them the chance to actually get to the truth and test out what somebody’s saying in a real way,” she said.Before they are finalized, the new regulations face a 60-day public comment period. During this time, anyone may submit a comment online for the department’s consideration. Emily Springston, director of the Office of Institutional Equity at IU, said the University will not make any changes to its policies or procedures until the rules have been finalized. It will instead spend the next month carefully reviewing the changes and participating in the comment period. Springston said a group within the office has been charged with spending the next month examining the details of the proposal and deciding what to comment on.  Springston said it is still too early in the process to know exactly how IU will respond to these changes because they are still in the comment period. “I’m hopeful that this isn’t the end and that we will see possibly the department listen to comments so we may have a final product,” she said.Despite the uncertainty, Springston said IU remains confident in its current policies and will continue them until told otherwise. These policies include a formal investigation and hearing if requested by the student. Direct cross-examination is not allowed in IU’s current system. “We’re just keeping our head down and standing by our policies and procedures,” Springston said. “And making sure we think that they are appropriate for everyone involved.”Lahn said that many colleges and universities do not offer live hearings for these cases, but because IU already does, she said the potential change she is most excited about is the inclusion of cross examination. “The Supreme Court, in one of its cases, said that, ‘cross-examination is the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of the truth,’” Lahn said. She said lawyers spend their careers practicing their ability to cross-examine a witness and develop strategies to help them uncover the truth. “You might put emphasis on a word in a certain way or have a pause in a certain place or you might ask a certain question and wait to see what the answer is to make your next question,” Lahn said. Despite her satisfaction with this proposal, Lahn maintains her belief that colleges and universities should not be handling these cases at all, and instead focus their efforts in providing the assistance to victims that the courts cannot.“They can move someone to a different section of biology, they can move someone to a different dorm, they can give you a different adviser, they can give you more time to take a test,” Lahn said. “No one at the police station can do that. No one at the Monroe County Circuit Court can do that.”\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Indiana law enforcement agencies received 78 reports of a hate crime last year, 10 of which were handled by Bloomington Police Department. Local law enforcement is working to combat these crimes.Although Indiana is one of only five states that doesn’t have any hate crime legislation, the state requires the Bloomington and IU Police departments to report them. A hate crime is defined by Indiana as an offense where a person has knowingly selected another person or property to damage based on color, creed, disability, national origin, race, religion or sexual orientation.IUPD’s Capt. Craig Munroe said the department reports hate crimes if bias is the crime’s motivation.  If the suspect of the crime was pushed to do so by bigotry or bias towards a certain group. Cops use clues and evidence from the crime scene and look into suspects' criminal history to see if there is bias in their motivation.“If I put a swastika on the wall of a white supremacist’s house, it would not be a hate crime because there is no bias,” Munroe said.Campus police go through diversity training before becoming officers, Munroe said, and hate crimes are constantly evolving. In 2013, the FBI added gender and gender identity to its list of groups affected by hate crimes. A main goal for officers handling these crimes is to find the motivation.“It is important that we are able to recognize but also understand these crimes, that we can work to prevent them,” BPD Capt. Steve Kellams said.BPD has been transparent by partnering with the Police Data Initiative, a group of law enforcement agencies and researchers that collect and publish police data. This transparency is important to the department because it builds trust and accountability, Kellams said. In addition to publishing hate crime statistics through PDI and the internet, BPD also sends them to the FBI through their Uniform Crime Reporting Program. The FBI recently published updated statistics, showing reported hate crimes up by more than 1,000 in 2017 versus the year before. However, there were approximately 1,000 additional police agencies reporting this year. “As cops we take these crimes very seriously,” Munroe said. “They have to be handled with care and attention.” The FBI reported an increase in U.S. hate crimes from 2014-2017.  This year, BPD has had five reported hate crimes according to the City of Bloomington’s website. Two of the reports were for assaults by white men, one anti-Jewish and one anti-black. Despite Indiana not having any hate crime legislation, Kellams said citizens can’t ignore them because of their effect on the community. “Reporting these crimes allows Bloomington to stay informed,” Kellams said “It gives people a better understanding of what is going on around them.” \",\n",

       "  'body': \"Another election season has come and gone, leaving behind a mess of soggy candidate yard signs and “I Voted!” stickers ruined by the Election Day rain.This year, Indiana experienced a spike in voter turnout fueled by the contentious Senate race between incumbent Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana, and now Republican Senator-elect Mike Braun. The $104 million spent on the Indiana Senate race was used to portray Indiana’s Senate seat as an exceptionally critical position for both political parties, which helped increase voter turnout across the state.Although it’s nice to see so many people engaged in their government during election season, it’s likely many voters only showed up to the polls to vote for the candidates running for federal offices. While electing our federal representatives is important, of course, Hoosiers need to remember that they’ve elected more than just federal legislators and that the end of election season doesn’t signify an end to their civic engagement.Though this year’s federal Senate race was vicious and heavily polarized, its results won’t have nearly as much of an effect on you and your community as state and local elections do.Annually, state legislatures enact far more laws than the federal governments does. State legislatures introduce 23 times the number of bills than the United States Congress does, totaling an average 128,145 bills per year. Indiana alone passed 215 bills between January and May of this year, with 210 passed during the regular legislative session and an additional five passed during a special session called by Governor Eric Holcomb.Not only do state legislatures pass more legislation annually than the federal government does, but they also affect the lives of their constituencies in a much more direct way. In Indiana, our state legislature has passed several bills in recent years that many Hoosiers have directly benefited from. The content of these bills include legalizing Sunday sales of alcohol, authorizing the use and sale of cannabidiol, or CBD oil, and establishing an assistance fund for the victims of sexual assault.Along with the work of our state legislature, local governments have a significant influence on many Hoosiers's day-to-day lives, too. From road construction to law enforcement to K-12 education — your local officials all have a say in what happens in your city.Yet while Indiana’s state legislators and public officials continue to work diligently for their constituents, too few of their electors even know their names.This November, half the members in the state Senate and all of the 100 members in the State House of Representative were up for re-election. Hundreds more ran for city and county offices throughout the state. Across Indiana, leaders within our communities actively campaigned for public office and sought your vote. Some were able to earn it, while others fell short.While it’s easy to be pessimistic about government because of the polarized gridlock at the federal level, state and local governments are more accessible, more collaborative and often more capable of serving their constituents. Many of the issues Hoosiers care deeply about can be better addressed by their state and local governments than by the federal government, which is exactly why voters need to remain engaged all year round.Now, as we begin to take down our favorite candidates’s yard signs and peel campaign stickers off our car bumpers, our newly elected state legislators and local officials are preparing to take office and begin their terms. Although election season may be over, for now, this shouldn’t be the end of public engagement in government — it should be just the beginning.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Senior Scott Olofson, co-founder of Tex’s BBQ, said everyone knew Tex.“He had friends all over the school, all over the country,” Olofson said.Tex’s BBQ was created in remembrance of Sigma Pi member Nic “Tex” Smith. It is an all-you-can-eat event with food and games. The event is 12 to 4 p.m. Nov. 11 at the Sigma Pi house, located at 1430 N. Jordan Avenue.Olofson said, in retrospect, the loud personality and big smile were signs Smith was masking some of his problems. Smith killed himself in January 2017, following periods of isolation and acting distant near the end of the fall semester. Smith was diagnosed with anxiety and was depressive.Junior Michael Broodo, Sigma Pi philanthropy chair and Tex’s BBQ co-founder, said the event is to help raise awareness for mental health as much as it is an homage to Smith.“It’s a fundraiser to support mental health initiatives on campus,” Broodo said.Broodo said he likes to think the event helps destroy the stigma around mental illness at IU.Tickets are $10, and all proceeds go to Counseling and Psychological Services, the Sexual Assault Crisis Service and the National Alliance on Mental Illness.This will be the first time funds will be given to SACS. He said sexual violence can make mental illness even worse, so he wanted to target it this year. The decision to give donations to SACS was a goal for this year’s president of Tex’s BBQ, Mike Zucker.The reason he felt the need to step up and take a leadership position in this event was because Smith’s younger brother, Stuart, is a member of his pledge class, Zucker said.Stuart Smith is not currently a student. He transferred to Collin College in McKinney, Texas. However, he is planning to return to the fraternity and IU during the fall 2019 semester.Stuart Smith said his family helped organize the barbecue and wanted mental health to be de-stigmatized so it would no longer to be an uncomfortable topic.“The biggest thing with Tex’s BBQ is leaving a legacy that mental health is totally a normal thing,” Stuart Smith said. “Everyone struggles with problems from time to time.”Stuart Smith said the barbecue helped him come to terms with his brother’s death.He said joining Nic Smith’s fraternity showed him all the people who loved his brother. Stuart Smith was able to learn what kind of person his brother was in college.Nic Smith's tendency to focus on other people’s mental health instead of his own hurt him, Stuart Smith said.“Our whole lives, my brother wanted to make sure everybody else was OK,” Stuart Smith said. “He really cared about other people, but more than he cared about his own mental state.”Olofson said the amount of money Sigma Pi raises doesn’t matter in the end. He cares more about raising awareness and reducing the stigma around mental illness. He said students have come up to him in the past and told him how much the event helped them.“It actually got them to take some of their first and second counseling sessions they didn’t even know existed,” Olofson said.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Google employees walked out across the world Thursday in protest of the company’s disregard for sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. The Google walkout brought employees from its headquarters in Mountain View, California, as well as Zürich, Switzerland, and Tokyo, Japan, out into the streets at 11:10 a.m. local time.The protest came after a New York Times investigation about sexual harassment and its handling at Google. The company has lacked transparency in this department. Google has remained silent about the three executives who have been accused of sexual misconduct in the past 10 years.Andy Rubin, the inventor of the Android, was accused of having coerced an employee into oral sex in 2013 while he was working at Google and was asked to resign after an investigation found the accusation to be credible. Rubin received $90 million when he left Google in 2014.The walkout also protested gender and racial discrimination and forces us to ask the question, are women in STEM safe? And if not, why not?If the Time’s Up and #MeToo movements have taught us anything, it’s that sexual harassment and sexual assault are pervasive issues affecting every corner of society. But women in STEM seem to be even more likely to be taken advantage of.STEM fields are male dominated, and men make up the vast majority of positions of power today, putting women at risk. Coming forward may jeopardize their career, and in a field with overwhelmingly male mentors, women may be harassed by the individual with the most influence over their career.A recent study from RTI International showed that women who experience sexual harassment in fields in sciences, engineering and medicine face long-term, negative effects on their careers, scientific productivity and opportunities for advancement.None of this is likely aided by the fact that stints at tech companies are short. Professionals stay with companies less than three years, on average. The short-lived nature of tenure in this field makes it difficult to hold offenders accountable after they’ve switched jobs. If victims of misconduct don’t come forward quickly enough, they lose their window to do anything about it.One long-term way to address the issue is to get more women in STEM. If women can get an equal hold of these fields, not only will they not be outnumbered, but women will also fill more and more of the positions of power that may have been abused. This starts early because young girls need to be encouraged to pursue STEM, reassured of their competence in a field where they may not see many role models that resemble them.Organizations like CEWiT at IU help keep women engaged in STEM as they grow older, and the reality of the workforce becomes more apparent. It’s not on women to brave an unsafe work environment, though.Offenders must be held accountable for their actions, regardless of how great some may find their contributions to society. Extra education on appropriate workplace conduct would not hurt in this industry.So often, men do not understand that what may be a joke to them can be degrading, dehumanizing and even threatening to women. We need to teach young people what is and is not okay before they enter the workforce. Educating women in STEM isn’t enough. We need to be educating everyone on consent. While we need more women in STEM, the battle is not won when we send a thousand more women toward enemy lines, it’s won when we defeat the enemy.The Google walk-out comes as no surprise to some. To others, it’s a reminder that even the most seemingly progressive of companies will put corporate interests before those of workers, even in the midst of sexual misconduct allegations. Either way, Google must be held accountable, offenders must be held accountable and we must hold ourselves accountable.',\n",

The written statement was his first public comment since an IU sexual misconduct hearing panel found Oct. 3 that he had committed sexual assault against another student and suspended him for two and a half years. He is permanently ineligible to play football.Ellison wrote in the statement that the accusations made against him were false and that IU did not handle the case properly.One of Ellison\\'s chief issues, according to the statement, was IU\\'s panel ignoring pivotal text messages he claims prove interactions with his accuser were consensual.“Additionally, The Panel made fundamental errors in its finding, including incorrectly identifying the timing of the Complainant’s texts — one of which, according to the IU Hearing Panel itself, exonerated me of these false charges,” Ellison said in the statement. “This indicates a lack of appropriate diligence, and a process at IU that was unable to conduct such a proceeding properly.\"He also stated the hearing process took only a “fraction” of time usually needed for such cases.

       "  'body': 'In light of the renaming of what was known as the Wildermuth Intramural Center earlier this month, students and faculty discussed renaming Jordan Hall on Friday afternoon at the Political and Civic Engagement program’s Free Speech Friday. Debate centered around the importance of the issue.David Starr Jordan, the namesake of the building, was a ichthyologist, a professor, the seventh president at IU and the founding president of Stanford University. But he also subscribed to eugenics, the belief and practice of improving the human population through select breeding of \"desirable\" genetic traits. Jordon wrote a series of publications titled \"The Blood of the Nation: A Study in the Decay of Races by the Survival of the Unfit\", which presented ideas about selective breeding and was aimed at bringing eugenics to the non-academic audience. Jordan wrote that people with low IQ scores, mental illness or any disability must be sterilized to improve the human species.In November of 2017, anonymous flyers were placed around Jordan hall with facts on them about Jordan’s contributions to eugenics. This began the movement to rename the hall.“A lot of people might not know the word ‘eugenics’ today at all but actually have absorbed a lot of the attitude that was promoted by not just David Starr Jordan, but tons of people a hundred years ago who had this idea that they were the best people, they were the elite and they were the ones whose type should be expanded,” associate professor Carl Weinberg said. Weinberg is a professor in the PACE program.Weinberg said American eugenics were the main inspiration for the Nazi’s “Final Solution.” Many famous Progressives, however, supported eugenics including W. E. B. DuBois, a black civil rights activist in the early 1900’s. Weinberg said eugenics was sometimes based more on classism than racism.Junior Moira Kehoe spoke to the University’s decision to change the name of Wildermuth Intramural Center and the connection to the issue of Jordan Hall.“I think you can’t justify not renaming it because you’re renaming the Wildermuth center,” Kehoe said. “Once you’ve done that, you’re kind of prioritizing what you consider to be acceptable and unacceptable.”Senior Parker Zent argued against the importance of changing a building’s name.“I think that we tend to get only worked up about the things that are easy for us to get worked up about,\" Zent. \"I can think of about 80 more important issues than this.” .To Zent, issues like poverty, homelessness, addiction, mental health, suicide and sexual assault should be the issues people are focusing on. Not the renaming of buildings.To others, serious social issues and the renaming of Jordan Hall are intertwined.“I think it’s time to get riled up about these things and while it may seems small, the name of a building, it’s like ‘Who cares, it’s the name of the building,\" it stands for something so much bigger,” junior Julia Weinstock said. “By standing up and saying, ‘No, this isn’t OK,\\' you’re standing up to the hate that has been normalized in this country now.”Senior Jazzmine Navarre spoke about the importance of not staying silent, especially about racial issues.“I think one of the biggest problems in America is people being quiet,” Navarre said. “That’s when bad things happen in American history. When no one tells you that you’re doing anything wrong, you can see that people will do whatever they want. They can enslave millions of people for 200 years because no one said it was wrong.”In March 2018, a middle school in Palo Alto, California named after Jordan changed its name from Jordan Middle School to Greene Middle School due to Jordan’s commitment to eugenics. Frank Greene Jr., the namesake of the renamed school, was a black leader in the tech industry who supported female and minority startups.Jordan was one of the founders of the Human Betterment Foundation which promoted sterilization programs in the United States that sterilized the genetically \"unfit.\" This especially included the inmates at state mental health facilities. He was a member of the  foundation and supporter of eugenics until his death in 1931.Indiana was the first state to enact compulsory sterilization legislation in 1907. It required physically and mentally disabled and ill people to be sterilized, which leaves a person unable to reproduce. According to the Indiana State Government website, there were approximately 2,500 sterilizations in Indiana during the time the bill was in place.Kehoe and Weinstock both spoke about making the learning environment of Jordan Hall more comfortable for everyone. Weinstock emphasized that renaming the building is especially important because it is a place where students are forced to be for classes.“I would rather have someone who has done something recently that has had such an impact to IU, that upholds the values they have today, rather than the values they had back then,” Kehoe said.',\n",

They then formed a line, led by a few holding a large white poster, boldly stating “Take Back the Night,\" and walked to the Monroe County Courthouse in silence.The assembled group Thursday night consisted of members of the Feminist Student Association and other organizations. The march, part of the annual Take Back the Night event, aimed to spread information about activist groups, share personal stories and raise awareness about sexual assault and domestic violence.“It’s about empowering women to take back their sexuality and own their bodies,” said Crimson Corps member Lydia Porter. Crimson Corps, a campus mental health organization, joined in the event organized by the Feminist Student Organization. National Organization for Women, RAISE, Protective Order Project and It’s on Us also joined. The night began with students gathering around tables to learn more about these organizations, sifting through t-shirts available for purchase and designing posters for the march. Then survivors came forward to speak about their experiences with sexual assault and abuse, surrounded by supporters holding burning candles in the darkness of Dunn Meadow.“The goal of the event is to raise awareness to issues like sexual assault and domestic violence and to provide a safe space for victims to share their experiences,” Dawson said.Feminist Student Association serves as an educational program for IU students, and offers presentations, debates and panels on feminist issues.“We are a political organization that takes a stand on feminist, social and political groups,” said Celia Dawson, communications director of Feminist Student Association. “FSA is an intersectional group that also fights oppression of gender, race, sexuality and class.”Dawson said Take Back the Night, and the Feminist Student Association as a whole, wants to be a voice for people who are too often silenced by institutions.Ibby Ahmed, co-director of the sexual well-being committee for Culture of Care, came to Thursday\\'s march for just that.“A lot of us are very scared to even be in Wells late at night alone,” Ahmed said. “So a lot of this is just about empowering us to take back the night, essentially, and be free to do what we want.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"One of the names that will appear on the ballot in Nevada this election season is Dennis Hof. He is the Republican candidate for the Nevada State Assembly. Perhaps he is better known as a pimp. Or, maybe you know him as someone who has been accused of sexual assault multiple times by the sex workers who work at his brothel. Maybe you even know him for calling President Donald Trump the “Christopher Columbus” for people like him. Or, maybe you’ve heard of him because he recently died. On Oct. 16, 2018, Hof passed away in one of his brothels after a night of political rallies and partying. Despite this, every word of this article is still true. Hof is the Republican candidate for Nevada State Assembly. His name will remain on the ballot, despite his recent death.When people in Nevada walk into the polls Nov. 7, 2018, they will have the option of choosing between a real, living Democratic candidate, Lesia Romanov, and a dead man. It seems, however, that even death cannot stop the red tide of Trump’s America. Even with his death, Hof is still projected to win. If he wins, a commission from each county will work together to appoint another Republican. People purposefully writing in the name of a dead person on their ballot is one thing, but officially having the name of a dead man on the ballot is a gross undermining of our democracy. Polling places will, supposedly, have signs posted that notify voters of his death, but that doesn't stop people from voting for their own party no matter the circumstances.Simply placing a sign in front of a polling place is not enough to justify keeping the name of a dead person on the ballot. Perhaps someone simply will not read or see the sign. According to a study by Vanderbilt University, people are more likely to vote for whichever name they have heard of before in a lower level election.Hof was the owner of many brothels and even a reality television star, making his name much more recognizable than Romanov’s, who is an assistant principal. So, people who don’t pay attention to their surroundings might go in and just pick Hof’s name simply because they recognize it. Republicans voting in Nevada will still probably vote for their party candidates regardless of the specific circumstances. They shouldn’t necessarily be blamed for voting for the Republican candidate, though. The blame should lie on the members of the government who are allowing this to happen.That being said, government officials take advantage of our culture of political divisiveness, knowing people will vote for their own party no matter what. Therefore, it doesn't even matter who is on the ballot. If the state has a Republican majority, then any Republican can win. This is the real problem that allows a dead man to run for office.Ideally, voters would study the candidates on the ballot in depth before showing up to vote, and then make an informed decision based on their platforms. Being a living, breathing person seems like an important part of a political campaign, but apparently many voters don't think so.Voting should not be complicated. People should be able to show up on election day, cast their ballots and not have to pay special attention to be sure that none of the candidates have died. In a country where many citizens already shirk the act of voting due to its perception, we don’t need anything else adding to the notion that voting is one big joke.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'The victim of an alleged sexual assault from 2014 testified Tuesday in the jury trial of Jordan Christopher Kelly, charged with one count of rape. Judge Marc Kellams said he hopes the jury will begin deliberations Wednesday and come to a decision after all the witnesses testify and attorneys give their final arguments instead of continuing Thursday or beyond if possible.The alleged incident began Nov. 1, 2014, when both Kelly and alleged victim were in Bloomington to attend Halloween parties with friends. At the time, both were college students, but neither attended IU-Bloomington. Kelly was a student at IU-Purdue University Indianapolis, and the woman was a student at Bellarmine University.The alleged victim, then 19, was staying with friends in Spruce Residence Hall the night of Nov. 1. The group drank alcohol, wore costumes and attended three parties. She said the third party was thrown by members of the IU Ski and Snowboard Club at a house just north of Collins LLC.  The woman said she met Kelly at the party and thought he was cute. They talked and kissed inside the party. In court Tuesday, the woman said she drank too much that night. On the defense attorney’s scale of one to 10, one being sober and 10 being alcohol poisoning, she thinks she was at about a 7 or 8.She said Kelly led her outside later in the night and proceeded to grope and rape her. She said she kept saying “no” and trying to push him away, but eventually he was on top of her and covered her mouth. When her friends found her and went back to the dorms in the early hours of the morning of Nov. 2, she told them she was raped, she said. They then took her to the hospital, but were told they would have to wait a few hours. The group went back to the dorms and returned to the hospital the next morning, where the alleged victim completed a sexual assault examination and talked to Bloomington police officers. Bloomington Police Department detective Sgt. Jason Shaevitz and two Indiana State Police forensics scientists also testified Tuesday.Samples from the woman’s exam and a swab of Kelly’s DNA taken by Shaevitz were sent to the Indiana State Police forensics lab in Indianapolis. Kelly’s DNA was found on swabs from the alleged victim’s upper lip. There was also a mixture of at least four different males’ DNA found on a sample from her neck, but there was not enough male DNA found from any other samples, including from her genitalia, to be tested. Five more witnesses, including the nurse who examined the alleged victim, are scheduled to testify Wednesday.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Actress Alyssa Milano tweeted  Oct. 15, 2017, “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.” In the year since Milano’s tweet, “#MeToo” has been used roughly 19 million times on Twitter, according to the Pew Research Center. The #MeToo movement brought issues surrounding sexual assault and harassment into the highest echelons of power and in small communities. At IU, student group leaders said it created an outpour of support. “It kind of created a social movement, in a sense, of working to support people who have been a victim of sexual misconduct,” said senior Ryan Arick, co-director of the sexual well-being committee for Culture of Care.Arick said the sexual well-being committee saw an increased number of people interested in joining their committee at this year’s call-out meeting.“Many people talked about the reason why they were interested was because that they wanted to make a difference and to change things, to support survivors of sexual assault and sexual misconduct,” Arick said. Adina Romaner is the co-director of Safe Sisters, a group of women from Panhellenic Association sororities who are trained by IU Health Center’s Sexual Assault Crisis Service to help sexual assault survivors. She said the group saw a surge of people interested in joining and seeking help from Safe Sisters in the wake of the #MeToo movement.  “It’s made it easier to be publicly aware and openly care about this issue,” Romaner said. She said the number of influential figures who came forward with their own stories of sexual misconduct helped inspire other survivors to tell their own.“The #MeToo movement gave awareness a face,” Romaner said. \"It gave people somebody to look up to.\"Zoe Peterson is the Sexual Assault Research Initiative director for the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction. She said since the #MeToo movement began, more people have become interested in research around sexual assault and harassment. “What I’m doing isn’t changing that much, but I think the level of interest is changing,” Peterson said. She said survivors sharing their stories helped people understand the prevalence of sexual misconduct better than statistics. “I think in many ways it was much more impactful, and I think it’s made people much more aware of how prevalent the problem is,” Peterson said.But those stories can be the source of the movement’s biggest criticisms. Arick said there is a counter movement on and off campus that casts doubt on survivors’ stories if they cannot account every detail of their assault. “I think it’s going to really, really tear apart survivors,” Arick said.Peterson said a backlash against the #MeToo movement can be concerning, but that doesn’t mean that the movement won’t create change. She said many feminist movements throughout history have faced similar adverse reactions.“Even though there may be some backlash, there’s still progress,” Peterson said. ',\n",

       "  'body': 'In editorial columns in the the Indianapolis Star and Huffington Post last week, IU political science professor William E. Scheuerman called the FBI investigation of allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh a “joke” and “partisan game.\"“People are going to see the court for what it’s unfortunately becoming — an extremely partisan instrument,” said Scheuerman, who attended Yale University with Brett Kavanaugh.Kavanaugh was confirmed Oct. 6 to serve as a Supreme Court Justice. However, his confirmation process was clouded by allegations from Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez that he committed acts of sexual misconduct in high school and college. The point he tried to make, he said, is that Kavanaugh’s confirmation process was bad for everyone – Ramirez,  Ford, the American people and even Kavanaugh. If the investigation had been done properly, Kavanaugh’s name might’ve been cleared, Scheuerman said.Scheuerman graduated from Yale in 1987, the same year as Kavanaugh, and they lived in Lawrance Hall together freshman year, he said. This residence hall is where Ramirez said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.In his columns, Scheuerman said he and other Yale classmates tried to contact the FBI during the investigation, but the FBI did not respond.Scheuerman said he wrote the articles because he was disgusted by the way the FBI apparently ignored the information offered by himself and others. He said he was also disturbed by statements Kavanaugh made in the hearings, Fox News interview and Wall Street Journal article. Kavanaugh told the Senate Judiciary Committee the first time he’d heard about Ramirez’s allegations was in the New Yorker article, but Scheuerman said Yale classmates have emails from people close to Kavanaugh that refute his claim. At least one person tried to send those emails to both the FBI and Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, but was either unsuccessful or was ignored, Scheuerman said. “It didn’t fit in with the story they wanted us to buy,” he said of Republican leaders. Scheuerman said he doesn’t think Kavanaugh ever let go of his work as a partisan political operative, and because of that, he won’t be a fair and impartial justice. He said he thinks Kavanaugh acted like a politician campaigning for the Supreme Court in an unprecedented way.“He ran a political campaign for the Court, and he knew which buttons to hit to make sure his constituents would fall into line,” Scheuerman said.Fellow Yale classmates discussed feeling conflicted about the hearings and allegations, Scheuerman said, until Kavanaugh’s Fox News interview and Wall Street Journal column.“A lot of them got very worked up with the Fox News interview because number one, it’s inappropriate to be in this campaign mode and number two, he was saying things people know aren’t true,” Scheuerman said. Many readers have e-mailed Scheuerman to respond to his columns, he said. About 60 to 70 percent of the emails have been negative, and he says the overall response has been gendered. The majority of the negative emails are from men, while the majority of the positive are from women. “I went to the FBI and many classmates did, and I think the FBI went out of their way to ignore that information,\" Scheuerman said.',\n",

       "  'body': '“Bohemian Rhapsody,” a biographical movie starring Rami Malek as the late Queen vocalist Freddie Mercury, will sing and dance its way onto multiplex screens everywhere Nov. 2, no doubt to box office success despite the antics of its original director.A troubled, behind-the-scenes history makes it more than just a significant film about a musical legend. It’s also an important piece of the “art versus artist” conversation.Bryan Singer, the film’s original director, who will still receive a directing credit on the film, was fired from the project late last year after he failed to show up on set several days in a row, forcing a stop to the production. The string of mysterious absences on Singer’s part came, you guessed it, in the midst of the #MeToo movement, as decades’ worth of allegations against him were resurfacing. On Dec. 4, Singer was fired. On Dec. 6, the studio announced Dexter Fletcher as replacement director, and Dec. 7, Singer’s name was back in the news, this time facing sexual assault charges from 2003. The victim was 17 years old.And thus the classic debate emerges: is it right to support good art when the artist himself is an alleged vile scumbag? Singer’s filmography is strewn with bona fide blockbuster hits and critically acclaimed classics. He directed 1995’s beloved crime caper “The Usual Suspects,” and only a few short years later he directed the blockbuster smash hits “X-Men” and “X-Men 2.”But like a great many men in Hollywood, Singer’s troubled history of sexual assault and misconduct allegations followed him to the top. In 1994, production on “The Usual Suspects” was briefly halted due to whisperings of Kevin Spacey’s inappropriate sexual behavior on set. Singer and his producers for “The Apt Pupil” were sued by the parents of one of the film’s cast members for allegedly filming their son and other minors nude without permission.“X-Men” actor Alexander Burton and a few others filed a lawsuit against the founders of up-and-coming company Digital Entertainment Network, of which Singer was a part, claiming that the founders physically and sexually assaulted them.In 2011, openly gay filmmaker Roland Emmerich said in an interview that he and Singer, also gay, made a tradition of scores of “twinks,\" which is slang for a young looking gay or bisexual man - at Pride parties each June. Emmerich added that “When (Singer) makes a New Year’s party, there’s like 600, 700 twinks running around.”Former child actor Michael F. Egan filed a lawsuit against Singer, alleging that when he was 17, Singer flew him to Hawaii multiple times under the guise of professional work, but fed him cocaine and alcohol and raped him.The aforementioned handful of allegations are far from the full story, but the takeaway is clear.Singer is a vile human being, and his movies bear the undeniable mark of a predator. And that\\'s what the \"art versus artist\" debate so often misses. Look no further than his four “X-Men” films, and you’ll find that the filmmaker’s predilection for youthful and even underage men — or, as Emmerich unglamorously put it, “twinks” — is on full display. Singer has a type — he’s blonde, slender, boyish and can be found in numerous iterations throughout the director’s work. Whether he\\'s Pyro, Ice Man or Quicksilver from the \"X-Men\" movies or the spandex-clad hero of \"Superman,\" he\\'s there, accompanied by the chilling implications of Singer\\'s gaze. One such twink, \"X-Men\\'s\" Alexander Burton, was even one of the great many to accuse Singer of sexual assault.And that’s unquestionably disturbing, a taint that renders his movies unwatchable in the face of the allegations because it calls to mind his unsavory fetishes and disturbing behaviors. That’s not an isolated phenomenon to Singer, either. Look no further than Kevin Spacey – with whom Singer worked on “The Usual Suspects” to see an actor who routinely portrayed sick and psychopathic predators, only to be outed as a sick predator himself. There are unquestionably significant pieces of art made by creators who’ve since been outed as deplorable individuals, but the real tragedy is that oftentimes in the face of such outings it’s hard to not find the individual’s putrid soul translated into the very fibers of their work.

       "  'body': 'An IDS column with the headline \"Democrats are using the sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh for selfish political gain\" elicited strong reactions from readers, many of whom disagreed with the argument made by IDS Opinion editor Ethan Smith. Below are some letters to the editor about the column, and a responding column written by IDS Opinion editor Emma Getz can be found here.From Celeste Coughlin of BloomingtonDear Ethan Smith,Your cold position toward survivors of sexual violence and weak argument against Democrats is disappointing.First, there is not a “strong double standard” between allegations against Representative Keith Ellison and Judge Brett Kavanaugh. There was only a limited investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations, whereas the Ellison investigation is ongoing. The two men hold drastically different positions of power and should therefore be held to different standards of scrutiny. One would hope the bar would be high for both. But I digress. Second, there is scientific research supporting how that survivors detail timelines. You have provided no rationale as to why Doctor Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony was “seemingly false” outside of mixed timelines. Next, the cited investigation report come from a party appointed criminal prosecutor where she states specifically that the evidence provided does not “satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard,” this only suggests this case would not stand in a civil or criminal court. This is not a criminal case but rather a job interview in which an alleged habitual abuser said something akin to ‘I like beer,’ 30+ times and cried. Furthermore, this investigator was  appointed by only Republicans. This implicit bias shows in the subversive language used in the report that undermines Ford’s account. I will offer no speculation as to why allegations of abuse split the Senate, but will file this under the growing category of ‘Republicans v. Women’. Your baseless allegations of a scheme that is ‘‘a disgusting, unethical move to attempt to obtain political power,” does a disservice to journalism. While your fallacies and assumptions damage journalism, your elitist protection presents a threat to half of the world’s population and their daily fight for existence, not to mention the survivors of sexual violence whose stories you throw away. Your reduction of sexual assault is why survivors of abuse stay silent because people like you have attempt to undermine survivors validity. Reducing a person\\'s trauma to contrite and poorly characterized parties is offensive to survivors. I hope you consider not only forming a better argument against the Democratic party but supporting it better too. If not for the women and survivors of sexual violence whose wounds you reopen by making such ostentatious claims but for the sake of the Indiana Daily Student’s reputation. From Madeline Klein of BloomingtonNote: Madeline Klein is a former IDS Opinion columnist.Though he claims to “stand by” the poorly executed, insensitive argument in his recent column on the Kavanaugh debacle, Ethan Smith would do well to heed his critics. First, there are the facts. Or in Smith’s case, the lack thereof. He poses many ill-informed questions regarding Ford’s account that a cursory Google search could have answered. Clinical psychologist and nationally recognized consultant Dr. Jim Hopper, who would have delivered an expert testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee had a truly thorough investigation been conducted, explains that outsiders cannot judge the central details of a traumatic event. Crucially, Hopper emphasizes that a survivor’s inability to produce details of public interest damages “nothing about the reliability of the details they do recall, and nothing about their credibility.” As clinical psychiatry professor Richard Alan Friedman has said to NBC, “such peripheral details” as the ones upon which Smith chose to harp “might not become memories at all.” It is, therefore, not even remotely unclear why Ford’s memory exhibits gaps. Questions about traumatic memory are easy to address for reasonably engaged and thorough journalists. That Smith fails so glaringly to answer them casts a shadow of incompetence on his column. Furthermore, because he proposes to address Democrats’ manipulation of Ford’s testimony for “selfish, unethical and deceitful motives,” it then becomes blatantly hypocritical when Smith’s own column deceives its readers for political gain. Rather than the promised critique of Democrats’ inadequacies, we receive an unpublishable mess of bait-and-switch misogyny. To be clear, I believe that legitimate criticism of Democrats’ actions is plausible and deserved. But that is not what Smith delivers.In the most poignant example of his journalistic malpractice, Smith performs concern that Democrats are “ruining lives,” including Ford’s, but predicates his entire argument on the act of discrediting a survivor of sexual assault, writing, “Ford has recently proven herself to be less and less credible.” Smith has no right to play the victimized male conservative. He isn’t wrong because he is a Republican man. He’s wrong because his argument neglects basic facts, misleads readers and attempts to discredit a survivor of sexual assault. From Josh Hoffer of BloomingtonNote: Josh Hoffer is a former IDS Opinion columnist and editor.Ethan Smith’s column discussing the alleged partisanship of Brett Kavanaugh’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing neglects to include scientific evidence concerning trauma’s effect on memory, falsely equivocates separate instances of assault allegations, and, most importantly, fails to properly recognize the trauma Christine Blasey Ford experienced. Smith focused on details Ford was unable to recall, but does not mention the details Ford testified she remembered: that someone she was “100 percent” certain was Kavanaugh “groped me and tried to take off my clothes” and “put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling.” Jim Hopper, an expert on psychological trauma, told Scientific American the central details of a traumatic experience are strongly conserved by the brain’s memory storage and retrieval regions, even when peripheral details are forgotten. Numerous other scientific articles published by researchers specializing in this field support Hopper’s statements. The focus by Smith — and Rachel Mitchell, the prosecutor who questioned Kavanaugh and Ford — on peripheral details surrounding Ford’s assault tells a woefully incomplete story. Smith’s discussion of unrelated domestic assault allegations further undermines his argument. Every assault allegation should be fully investigated, a process that may take longer than a week, involve more than nine interviews of people, and perhaps even include more witnesses who are not “already sympathetic” to the abuser. Declining to turn over video evidence may result in unsubstantiated claims. Testifying to a wall of scowling men is far less insubstantial. Importantly, neither case can prove that the assault did not happen. Smith tweeted he “was saying that Dr. Ford was probably sexually assaulted,” but he spends far more of his article discussing Ford’s supposed “lack of credibility” and “seemingly false allegations.” Smith failed to contextualize this event as one that occurred in a society in which judicial leniency — or Smith’s lauded “insubstantial findings“ — have resulted in only 0.6 percent of rape cases ending in incarceration. Or in a society in which fraternity members are more than three times more likely to engage in sexually aggressive behaviors. Or in a society where Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, calls Ford an “attractive,” “pleasing” witness. Ford’s pain — a pain familiar to millions of women — should be given a little more thought next time.  ',\n",

       "  'body': 'Ethan Smith,  IDS opinion editor and columnist, published a column Oct. 3 with the headline, “Democrats are using the sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh for selfish political gain.” Many readers found problems with the argument presented in the column and took to Twitter or contacted the IDS to voice their concerns about the column. Their responses can be found here.I share many of those concerns and believe the column does not succeed in arguing the claim suggested by the headline.There is absolutely something to be said about how members of the Democratic party viewed the situation as a means to make sure Kavanaugh was not confirmed for the Supreme Court. The main objective should have been to seek justice for Christine Blasey Ford. However, the column does not argue this. The majority of the column focuses on how Ford’s accusations are, in the words of the writer, “seemingly false”.The column seems to imply justice for Ford is somehow wrong by focusing on the allegations against Kavanaugh are “seemingly false” solely based on Ford’s inability to remember certain details about the situation. Using this as the argument for why her accusations are false shows a gross misunderstanding of trauma, especially related to sexual assault.Rape and trauma survivors often have fragmented or incomplete memories related to their trauma. This is largely due to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for executive function, shutting down in response to fear.\"When the executive center of the our brain goes offline, we are less able to willfully control what we pay attention to, less able to make sense of what we are experiencing, and therefore less able to recall our experience in an orderly way,\" said Dr. James Hopper and Dr. David Lisak in a Time report.The column also overlooks the credibility of Kavanaugh’s claims. If time is spent diving into Blasey Ford’s credibility, it seems fair to look at Kavanaugh’s. He offered vague answers, including whether or not he knew about allegations by Deborah Ramirez, dodged some questions about his drinking habits in high school and college and even responded to questions with questions to Senators.The column goes on to discuss how the allegations will affect Kavanaugh’s life.“The Democrats\\' scheme of ruining the lives of others through some duplicitous application of the law is a disgusting, unethical move to attempt to obtain political power,” Smith wrote in his column.The lives of rich, powerful white men are not ruined by sexual assault allegations in the way that Smith claims they are.Kavanaugh was successfully sworn in as a justice to the Supreme Court. President Donald Trump has been accused of sexual assault by at least 22 different women, and he is the president. It seems like the lives of these men have not been ruined at all, and instead, they preside in some of the most powerful positions in the United States.If any argument about lives being ruined in situations of reporting sexual assault is going to be made, then we should be talking about the lives of women. It is extremely difficult to come forward, especially when so many seem eager to discredit them.We have to stop assuming women are looking for something to gain when they report sexual assault, and instead, listen to them and treat them with respect.A 2010 U.S. study estimates that only between 2 and 10 percent of rape accusations are false, which is a fairly small amount. Further, in a study undertaken for the British Home Office, the most detailed study ever conducted about sexual assault reports to the police, out of 216 complaints that were classified as false, the accuser lodged a formal complaint in 126 cases. From there, only 39 complainants named a suspect and six led to an arrest, and ultimately, only two led to charges which were then deemed false.This column is poorly argued at best, but actively harmful at worst. There is no reason to blatantly disrespect Ford by attempting to discredit her story while at the same time putting full faith in Kavanaugh’s statements without even analyzing them. If Smith wants to make the argument that Democrats have mistreated Ford, he should do so without mistreating her himself. ',\n",

       "  'body': \"Yells of “No justice, just us” filled Kirkwood Avenue on Oct. 9 as a group of about 30 protesters marched from Sample Gates to the Monroe County Courthouse.The group was protesting the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was voted in Oct. 6 amidst allegations of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford.Some held signs made by the protest organizers, members of the Young Democratic Socialists of America at IU, while others brought their own.The signs had phrases like “corrupt body is a corrupt system” and “#No Justice Just Us.”YDSA member-at-large, Thomas Metcalf, said the purpose of the protest was to get talking about the issues raised by Kavanaugh’s confirmation. They mentioned they felt Kavanaugh is a threat to marginalized people, the environment and communities.Metcalf said they started planning the protest with other political student organizations right after Kavanaugh was confirmed. YDSA member Rishi Raman spoke in front of the Sample Gates to start off the protest. “He’s obviously a sexual harasser,” Raman said to protesters. “We have to fight that. We have to fight him. We have to fight Trump.” He said people need to fight anyone who hates minority groups. Protesters cheered and snapped once he was done speaking. YDSA member Tommy DeNardo then encouraged others to speak. “We want to hear from everyone,” he said. “This affects all of us.” Raegan Davis, president of College Democrats at IU, stepped onto the ledge of one of the flower beds as she spoke. She said she would be mad and riot if Brett Kavanaugh does anything to Roe v. Wade or other landmark cases.“Even if you don’t believe the woman, the fact is this is a person who is incredibly dangerous,” she said.Abby Ang with Indivisible Bloomington spoke next and encouraged people to vote but added discussion cannot end there. She also spoke about how she felt Ford was treated. “We can’t just believe woman when it's convenient politically,” she said. After that, the group set off down Kirkwood Avenue. Metcalf said once they got to the courthouse, a few more protesters spoke and then it ended. “Overall, I think it went very well considering it was organized on such short notice,” Metcalf said after the event. “We think it’s a good step toward getting people mobilized and demanding that the government be accountable to us.”\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Everyone needed a break.Group members of Raising Awareness of Interactions in Sexual Encounters sat around tables Monday night coloring, drinking tea, eating cookies and discussing newly-appointed U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s recent confirmation. This meeting was centered on unwinding.RAISE is made up of people who feel strongly about sexual assault issues, and many are survivors of sexual abuse or know someone affected by it. RAISE has existed as an IU-affiliated sexual assault education group for more than 20 years, but it has evolved over its time on campus. It is currently a group of 10 to 15 students with loose ties to the Health Center’s Sexual Assault Crisis Service through their advisor and SACS counselor Ann Skirvin. RAISE has similar goals as bigger, more prominent sexual assault awareness student groups and campaigns such as Culture of Care and It’s On Us. However, Ashlee Critser, director of events, and Maddie Neu, treasurer, said their organization has looser ties to IU than University-sponsored groups such as Culture of Care. This allows RAISE to be more vocal against how IU handles sexual assault cases and to advocate for resource options outside the University.“I think Culture of Care and It’s On Us have students that are doing great work but there is more University influence in the messaging which can be a positive thing but also bring restrictions as far as responses to certain issues on campus,” Critser said.Even though RAISE is still connected with SACS, which is University-run, it is only connected through their advisor who doesn’t heavily influence their messaging.Critser and Neu brought up the example of an IU student who was sexually assaulted and publicly complained earlier this year about IU’s process of investigating sexual assault cases and the resources available on campus for survivors. “When Culture of Care made a statement, they made a statement including more IU resources which kind of ignored the issue at hand,” Critser said.Critser said it’s important for students to be aware of IU resources but that it’s also important to be aware of other options.RAISE’s statement in response to the student’s public complaints and accusations included resources for survivors that were more community and nationally based such as Middle Way House and the National Sexual Assault Telephone Hotline that were not University affiliated.Critser said stories about allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh and three recent reports of rape in Bloomington, two of which were on IU’s campus, make it a stressful time for survivors.“I know a lot of people are reliving experiences, whether it was something that happened to them directly or to someone close to them or just showing general empathy,” Critser said.RAISE leads consent training for classes and student organizations, and Critser said one of the topics she likes to emphasize most is the importance of letting a survivor who confides in you make their own decision of whether to report the incident or not.“It’s all about reclaiming the power that has been take away from them,” Critser said. “Sexual assault is a crime of power, and there is no wrong way to react.”Looking to the future, Neu said RAISE has a big to-do list.In order to be more inclusive, RAISE wants to be more intentional about their presentations being geared toward the LGBT community and male survivors. The group also wants to grow in membership. RAISE’s overall goal for the future is to push IU to change how it deals with sexual assault reports and change how people react to national figures in the spotlight for sexual assault allegations.As RAISE sipped their tea, Critser decided it would be appropriate to show the widely-known YouTube video “Tea and Consent” that compares giving tea to having sex.“If you can understand how completely ludicrous it is to force people to have tea when they don’t want tea and you’re able to understand when people don’t want tea, then how hard is it when it comes to sex,” the video said. “Whether it’s a tea or sex, consent is everything.”',\n",

       "  'body': \"The past couple weeks have been busy for Middle Way House.The nearly non-stop media coverage evaluating the credibility of Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has created a challenging atmosphere for staff at Middle Way, a domestic violence and sexual assault support center in Bloomington.“They live this every day,” executive director Debra Morrow said. “They live hearing these stories.”Calls to the center’s crisis line have increased in the past couple weeks, said Stephanie Waller, one of two crisis intervention services coordinators. While weekly metrics aren’t tracked, the program received 356 calls in  September 2018 — up more than 100 from September 2017. It’s difficult to pinpoint the cause of this increase. Media attention on Kavanaugh’s confirmation could have provoked emotions from a past trauma, Waller said, but the underlying reasoning is seldom explained. This is not the first time survivors of sexual assault have had to navigate potentially triggering media coverage. From May 2017 – before the resurgence of the #MeToo movement – to August 2018, articles on sexual assault have increased by 30 percent, according to a study by the Women’s Media Center. “We have weathered our way through many, many storms,” Waller said. “This is just the biggest one in recent memory.”When someone calls the crisis line, which operates at all hours every day of the year, a trained volunteer will help determine the caller's need. Some seek resources, others seek a listening ear.  In some cases, the volunteer will direct people to on-scene advocates who accompany those seeking assistance to the hospital, police station and a few other public places.The decision whether to report an instance of sexual or domestic violence — though heavily discussed on social media — is not an issue on which Middle Way House takes a stand.“Survivors can feel a lot of pressure to report or not report, depending on their situation,” Waller said. “We are not there to be another source of pressure on them.”Waller said the onset of #whyIdidntreport can offer a sense of validation for people navigating those pressures. “There are very important reasons why people choose not to do this,” Waller said. While Ford has been applauded for her bravery, Morrow said some people may find bravery in keeping their stories private, which is OK. And despite national controversy, locals still contact Middle Way House for the same basic services. Problems like housing and food insecurity remain unchanged.“We're still here for survivors,” Waller said. “Survivors still need us.”Fulfilling those essential needs is accompanied by an effort to prevent peers and clients from feeling hopeless, Waller said.Middle Way House has organized several events throughout October in honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Waller said keeping a forward-thinking mindset, and leading by example, is key. “This was hard, but things have been hard already,” Waller said. “We’re going to keep going no matter what.”A previous version of this story incorrectly stated Middle Way House received 356 calls from January to September 2018, when in fact it received 356 calls in just the month of September. This is up more than 100 from September 2017, not the entire year 2017. The IDS regrets this error.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'On Saturday, Brett Kavanaugh became the newest member of the Supreme Court after a vote of 50-48.Kavanaugh was accused of multiple credible allegations of sexual assault, yet Senate Republicans ultimately had no problem in allowing him to assume a lifetime appointment on the highest court in the country, as it shifts to a 5-4 conservative majority. Even though Kavanaugh wrote in the Wall Street Journal that he would be an independent and apolitical arbiter, his testimony for the Senate Judiciary Committee blamed the opposition to his nomination specifically on the Clintons and left-wing opposition groups. The testimony also showed that he has absolutely no problem with lying to get what he wants. And now Republicans will as well. The continuous threat of rollbacks to protections for people of color, women, the LGBTQ community and the environment is even more likely.Possibly the only silver lining to this entire process has been the inevitable realization among many Democrats that the Supreme Court is not an independent institution, which Republicans have known for a long time. If the Supreme Court isn’t partisan, Trump and the GOP never would have fought as hard as they did to confirm Kavanaugh.It is time for Democrats to play to win, and they can do so by packing the court. The Constitution does not require exactly nine members to be on the Supreme Court, and many on the left have called for adding two, or even six, additional justices that would be supportive of left-wing programs.This can only be done by winning the presidency and the upcoming midterm elections and passing legislation in both houses of Congress, which is no easy task, but its effects would be extremely beneficial and last for decades to come. Universal health care, expanded voting rights and increased wages could all be deemed unconstitutional by a conservative Supreme Court if they were to pass through Congress, but a Democratic president packing the court with additional justices could prevent it. Past presidents have advocated or implemented court packing, including Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, with the goal of carrying out popular, progressive agendas that would otherwise be threatened. Other movements, like those fighting for Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico to become states, enacting term limits and abolishing the electoral college should absolutely be supported. Though many of them are harder to achieve, the goal is to try and fix what is clearly broken in this country, including the fact that the current justices do not accurately represent popular opinion. Four of the now nine Supreme Court justices have been appointed by presidents and a party who lost the popular vote. Two of the nine have also been credibly accused of sexual assault. The idea of court packing may not be popular with those who see the court as a sacred institution and don’t want it to somehow lose its legitimacy, but Republicans have repeatedly shown that this is not possible. After former President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland, they refused to appoint him and threatened to continue to do so even if Hillary Clinton won the election. In effect, they restructured the court to only eight justices for almost a year. The “nuclear option” was also implemented early into Trump’s presidency in order to abandon the 60-vote threshold to confirm Supreme Court nominations and instead replace it with a simple majority. The question becomes what Democratic leaders should value more — the lives and well-being of the people or political norms?',\n",

Little, a senior in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs’ Washington Leadership Program, said the group first made it to the Supreme Court building. They passed a number of women sobbing as they made their way through the street.“People were crying, but then there was just an energy, I guess,” Little said.  “Overwhelming energy, pushing for, like, big voter turnout in the midterms in November.”Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate to serve as an associate justice on the Supreme Court in the most narrow vote margin since the 19th century. Kavanaugh’s confirmation process was clouded by multiple allegations that the judge had committed acts of sexual misconduct in high school and college. One of his accusers, Christine Blasey Ford, faced hours of questioning from Senate Judiciary Committee members.Maggie Bott, a senior and head of the Middle Way House Chapter at IU, said though the  Bloomington community was making progress toward believing sexual assault survivors, Ford\\'s public questioning by senators may not have helped this development.“I’m really hoping that survivors can still come to us at Middle Way House, but I think it’s going to be a lot harder for them to get over that barrier to tell somebody about their experiences,” Bott said.Bott said she was inspired by the large number of people who showed up in Washington to  support Ford and the other women who have alleged misconduct by Kavanaugh. “I think it’s wild that people make the claim that it’s a scary time for men because we just want accountability and a safer world for everybody,” Bott said.Krishna Pathak, a senior, said Kavanaugh’s confirmation was indicative of a “persisting and everlasting prejudice against women in America.”From a policy perspective, Pathak said, it was troubling to see what appeared to be the White House overseeing the one-week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh. The investigation was commissioned after Ford and Kavanaugh testified before the Judiciary Committee.Not all IU students were opposed to Kavanaugh\\'s nomination. \"I think the Kavanaugh hearing, and the confirmation thing, for a lot of conservatives is a multifaceted issue,\" freshman Geneva Mazhandu said. Mazhandu said she saw the process as overly politicized and that as a conservative, due process was one priority influencing her perspective. \"By supporting Kavanaugh, I\\'m not saying I don\\'t believe people who have been assaulted,\" Mazhandu said.Junior Noah Davidson said Kavanaugh’s confirmation made him feel disappointed in his government, especially because of how narrow the vote was.“It’s also, I think, a huge slap in the face to the #MeToo movement,” Davidson said.  Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana, voted against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. His Republican counterpart, Sen. Todd Young, voted in favor of Kavanaugh\\'s confirmation.Pathak pointed out that Donnelly voted to confirm Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court but did not do the same with Kavanaugh and said it was indicative of how he viewed the high court and its nominees. There were other options apart from Kavanaugh, Pathak said.“Donnelly has a defense, in my opinion,” Pathak said. “A meritable, credible defense.”Davidson said he doesn’t agree with everything Donnelly’s voted for in the Senate but that this vote changed his perspective on the senator.“I think this vote in particular has really made me realize how important it is to have those Democrats in the Senate, even if we don’t agree with them all the time,” Davidson said.Little said had Donnelly voted \"yes,\" she would not be voting for him in November. He took a stand and won some of her respect, she said.“I think it gives him legitimacy,” Little said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'UPDATED (7:49 p.m.):IU spokesman Chuck Carney declined to comment on Morgan Ellison\\'s status as a student and whether or not he should be on campus.However, Ellison was on campus Thursday attending class.Carney said the case is ongoing.It’s unclear whether the University sexual misconduct hearing panel\\'s determination and punishment has gone into effect yet. When a determination is made, the defendant has five days to file an appeal, according to IU’s sexual misconduct policy. If an appeal is filed, the punishment is suspended until the appeal is resolved. It’s unclear whether or not the defendant’s punishment is in effect between the initial determination and the deadline to file an appeal.When asked to clarify the policy, Emily Springston, University Director of Institutional Equity & Title IX, referred back to the policy. ***A University sexual misconduct hearing panel determined football player Morgan Ellison sexually assaulted another student, according to records obtained and included in a report Wednesday night by IndyStar. The panel determined Ellison should be suspended from IU for 2.5 years and explained its decision in a letter dated Oct. 3. IU Coach Tom Allen said on Oct. 2 that Ellison had returned to practicing with the IU football team while he was still suspended indefinitely.Ellison\\'s long-term future with the program was unknown. On Monday, Allen said there was \"no additional update\" when asked about Ellison\\'s status. Under the terms of the panel\\'s determination, he is not allowed to be on any IU campus, according to the report. Ellison can appeal the panel\\'s ruling until Thursday. Ellison declined to comment for this story, deferring to his lawyer. According to Monroe County court records, he has not been charged with a crime.An IU Athletics spokesperson declined to comment on Ellison\\'s status.The panel\\'s report states it determined Ellison sexually assaulted another IU student while she slept, and he used force to continue the assault when she woke up.The IndyStar report states that during his hearing, Ellison denied using force and said all sexual activities that occurred were consensual.According to the report, the panel\\'s determination will also require Ellison to undergo counseling, and he is prohibited from having contact with the student he is accused of assaulting.According to an IU Athletics release, Ellison was suspended from all football activities Aug. 24.Neither Allen, nor IU Athletic Director Fred Glass, have discussed specifics related to why Ellison was suspended.Earlier this month, several sources with IU Athletics confirmed to the IDS that Ellison was no longer a member of the team.Ellison was set to be IU\\'s starting running back for the 2018 season after a breakout freshman season in 2017. He led the team in rushing last season with 704 yards on 143 rushing attempts.He was twice named the Big Ten Freshman of the Week during the 2017 season and was also named IU’s Offensive Newcomer of the Year.This story will be updated.',\n",

       "  'body': 'As of Thursday night, a letter published in the New York Times on Oct. 3 opposing the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has been signed by more than 2,400 law professors, 39 of which are IU and IU- Purdue University Indianapolis professors.The letter will be presented to the Senate Oct. 4.“We regret that we feel compelled to write to you, our Senators, to provide our views that at the Senate hearings on Sept. 27, Judge Brett Kavanaugh displayed a lack of judicial temperament that would be disqualifying for any court, and certainly for elevation to the highest court of this land,” the letter says.Kavanaugh and California professor Christine Blasey Ford were questioned in a Senate hearing last week about Ford’s accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while the two were in high school. The Judiciary Committee approved the candidate after tense debate Friday for a full Senate vote, but that vote was delayed up to one week to allow for an FBI investigation.The letter specifically mentions Kavanaugh’s aggressiveness towards those questioning him. It cites congressional statutes regarding bias with judges, saying judges and justices are supposed to be disqualified if impartiality is questioned. The letter ended by saying the professors had differing views on Kavanaugh\\'s other qualifications, but that they are ultimately united. “But we are united, as professors of law and scholars of judicial institutions, in believing that he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.” Clinical associate professor of law at IU, Jennifer Prusak, was one of the faculty who signed this letter. “My reasons for signing it were pretty simple,” she said. “Leaving aside the truth or lack of truth behind the allegations that led to Thursday’s hearing last week, I thought that he showed a staggering lack of respect to the senators questioning him as well as an incredibly partisan viewpoint of the whole proceeding.” She said she felt the extent to which he displayed such a partisan view worried her and made her feel he wasn’t fit for the supreme court. Professor Emeritus of law at IU Alex Tanford said he signed the letter for similar reasons. He said a lot of the worry from people comes from the fact that Kavanaugh\\'s appointment to the court would result in a Republican majority.However, he said he is not signing it because Kavanaugh is a conservative Republican. He is signing it because of the way Kavanaugh acted at the hearing. “He completely lacks the calm, judicial temperament that one needs to be on the Supreme Court,” Tanford said.He said he felt frightened by the very partisan comments Kavanaugh made. “As lawyers and law professors we teach a legal system that is based upon the premise that judges will practice impartial judgment,” he said. He doesn\\'t feel that Kavanaugh would do so and is frightened by the possibility of him being confirmed. He said it would take a generation for the government to recover. “It is frightening that the Senate Republicans are so determined to push this through,” he said.Prusak said she was sent the letter by colleague Dawn Johnsen, another professor of law at IU. Johnsen said she was sent the letter from two professor she knew, one at Yale and one at IU-Purdue University Indianapolis. She circulated the email to IU faculty on Wednesday morning and many law professors signed it.She said she believes the large response is due to how partisan Kavanaugh appeared at the hearings. \"I\\'ve never seen anything like it,\" she said. “It\\'s just so absolutely clear the way he acted is inappropriate for someone who’s a judge.\"For her, she said signing the letter was an easy decision even though she often doesn\\'t sign group letters.“This one was just absolutely clearly correct and so incredibly important and I just am very sad at the prospect of having someone on the Supreme Court who has violated fundamental rules of being a judge, impartiality and partisanship,\" she said. This story was updated to include a new number of signees and information from Dawn Johnsen. ',\n",

       "  'body': 'After Christine Blasey Ford made accusations of sexual assault against U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, some people have voiced concerns that these allegations may be false.But it can be a slippery slope toward never believing any crime occurs once people start to discredit women who come forward with stories of sexual assault, said Brenda Weber, chair of the IU gender studies department.Weber led a town hall-style discussion Tuesday in the Paul H. O’Neill Graduate Center about Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court, the sexual assault allegations against him, media coverage of the issue and the Senate hearings with the nominee and Christine Blasey Ford. “I will admit I have been a little obsessive in my intake of all this,” Weber said.The meeting is part of a series organized by the School of Public and Environmental Affairs where students and faculty discuss current events and how they relate to campus. SPEA Town Hall Tuesdays feature professors whose fields pertain to that week’s topic.“We don’t really have an agenda here,” said Emily Cox, senior associate director of marketing communications. \"We just want a discussion.\"One student brought up a National Review article she said compared the Kavanaugh hearings to those in “To Kill A Mockingbird,” where lawyer Atticus Finch receives criticism from the town for defending a black man who was falsely accused of raping a young woman. The article said the book shows people must be cautious in believing women who claim to have been sexually assaulted and always give due process to the accused. Weber said it’s important to remember the book is fiction, and it should not be used as a basis for how to treat sexual assault accusations in real life. “That is a sociological story that isn’t as sexy to tell,” Weber said. Another person asked Weber what IU, in its efforts to establish a culture of care, can take away from these hearings. Students need to stop using a friendship or a bond with a fraternity as a reason to not report or stand up to sexual assault, Weber said.“There is a large problem where people feel a loyalty to a different ethos,” Weber said. “If you see behavior that you believe is unacceptable, it is your responsibility to stop it.”Kavanaugh and Ford’s demeanors during their testimonies and how they have been scrutinized were discussed as well. Weber said that while Kavanaugh was testifying, he displayed male rage by yelling at and interrupting senators. The town hall concluded with a discussion on how to help combat the culture of sexual assault. Cox said coming together and using certain platforms such as a town hall discussion to voice concerns and questions is a great start.“Use your voice to help and protect yourself, but also for others,” Cox said.',\n",

       "  'body': 'The handling of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh are among some of the most disgusting and unethical that this country has ever seen.The nature and purpose of the U.S. Supreme Court is to be separate from politics and distant from any partisanship. However, Kavanaugh’s nomination has proven that some refuse to respect the foundation of this country and its highest source of justice.Democrats in Congress have turned allegations from Christine Blasey Ford into nothing more than a game with a reward of political power by using her testimony for selfish, unethical and deceitful motives.  There have been recent allegations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota, which have since been proven insubstantial after an investigator stated that \"an allegation standing alone is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that conduct occurred.” Democrats ought to honor the insubstantial findings in Kavanaugh\\'s case just the same as they have in Ellison\\'s, otherwise it forms a strong double standard.  Now is one of the most vital opportunities for political gain in the eyes of the left. If they can prevent Kavanaugh from being voted onto the Supreme Court, then they hope President Trump would not have enough time to nominate and the Senate enough to confirm a nominee before the midterm election.  After that, Democrats hope they will win a majority in Congress, allowing them to prevent any nomination from Trump to be confirmed in the next two years. This would leave a vacancy on the Supreme Court, providing hope that, if a Democratic president were elected in 2020, there would be a newfound opportunity to appoint a liberal justice to the Court.  This series of political motivations would lead to a federal government — of all three branches — to be controlled by the Democratic party.What makes this scheme even worse is that Ford has recently proven herself to be less and less credible, establishing this political agenda on seemingly false allegations.Rachel Mitchell, the nonpartisan prosecutor hired by the Senate Judiciary Committee to question both Kavanaugh and Ford last week, issued a report finding Ford’s testimony to be weak.  “Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event, and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them ... I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee,” Mitchell stated in her report, then followed with a detailed nine-point critique of Ford’s testimony. To start, Ford could not remember when the alleged incident occurred. On July 6 she said to the Washington Post that it occurred in the \"mid 1980s,\" then weeks later changed it to the \"early 80s\" in a letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein.  A week later during her polygraph test she claimed it happened one \"high school summer in early \\'80s,\" then crossed out \"early\" without explanation. And therapist notes from 2013 show that she described the assault as happening in her \"late teens.\"While it is reasonable for victims to forget dates, Ford never offered an explanation as to how she could suddenly come up with a specific season in a specific year after years of uncertainty. Over the course of years of therapy she was also unable to assign a name to the person who sexually assaulted her even after years of Kavanaugh in the news for his service.  Furthermore, Mitchell states in her report that “Dr. Ford has no memory of key details of the night in question — details that could help corroborate her account,” specifically such as who invited her to the party where the alleged incident took place, who else was at the party, how she heard about the party, how she got to the party, how she got back home, when she got to the party, when she left, who drove her to or from the party, at whose house the party took place or where the house was located.Curiously enough, however, she remembers small details like that she had “exactly one beer at the party and was taking no medication at the time of the alleged assault.”Making her testimony appear even weaker, the three people whom Ford recalls being at the party — including her lifelong friend Leland Keyser — don\\'t remember the party.These critiques are more than sufficient in proving the lack of credibility of Ford, yet Democrats continue to push their political agenda by attempting to ruin the lives of both Ford and Kavanaugh.Ford may have been sexually assaulted in high school, however, there is absolutely no corroborating evidence naming Kavanaugh as the assaulter.The Democrats\\' scheme of ruining the lives of others through some duplicitous application of the law is a disgusting, unethical move to attempt to obtain political power.If these allegations have proven anything it is that we have and continue to need a system of innocent until proven guilty within the justice system in our country — and Democrats are not going to be able to change that by dragging out false allegations for selfish, political gain.

       "  'body': 'Brett Kavanaugh is up for nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. The nomination was controversial to begin with, but has faced an incredible amount of backlash in light of recent sexual assault allegations.Kavanaugh has been accused of sexual assault by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and accused of exposing himself by Deborah Ramirez. The FBI will be investigating the accusations.Dispute has arisen between those who believe the allegations and those who argue that Kavanaugh is “innocent until proven guilty.” These two are not mutually exclusive, especially considering that Kavanaugh is not on trial here.If he is appointed to the Supreme Court, he will be serving all of America. The country is watching. He’s at a job interview.And he is bombing it. I believe those who come forward about sexual assault, but that is irrelevant. Regardless of whether or not the allegations are true, Kavanaugh has displayed an incredible lack of decorum in the hearing.“Do you like beer, Senator, or not?\" Kavanaugh asked Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. \"What do you like to drink?\"He repeatedly disrespected Senator Klobuchar, turning her questions back on her, when she asked him if he’d ever been so drunk he couldn’t remember the night before.This sort of behavior is unprofessional, unimpressive and surely unfit for a justice of the United States Supreme Court.The question comes down to why we are still considering him at all. There is no shortage of potential appointees eager to overturn Roe v. Wade. Kavanaugh is somewhat different in how highly he regards presidential power. His appointment would be an excellent move for President Trump.We should be wary of Kavanaugh from every angle. As a man willing to strip women of their reproductive rights, as a man accused of sexual assault and as a man who will let Trump run rampant and unchecked, he threatens women’s health, women themselves and, regardless of party affiliation, the system of checks and balances the U.S. government depends upon to function.Furthermore, Kavanaugh is upsetting in how he treats other human beings. His behavior at the hearings alone told me enough to deeply oppose his appointment. No man who behaves so childishly, who is so volatile, should be holding one of the highest offices in the country.Kavanaugh is in no way entitled to this job. He is a candidate. If a candidate at a minimum wage job can be thrown out because their application causes trouble, and an employer won’t hire people based on their social media, why should Brett Kavanaugh, who wants to be on the Supreme Court of the United States of America, get special treatment and additional chances?',\n",

       "  'body': 'For Raegan Davis, president of College Democrats at IU, the implications of U.S. Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh being approved are personal.“If we can’t rely on him to respect women outside the courtroom, we can’t rely on him to respect women in the courtroom,” Davis said.As a part of the LGBTQ+ community and a survivor of sexual assault, Davis said she feels Kavanaugh’s views and past actions make him unfit for being appointed.Davis spoke during the Political and Civic Engagement program’s first Free Speech Friday event where attendees discussed the Kavanaugh nomination. At the same time, senators in Washington, D.C. were deciding how to proceed with the nomination after Thursday’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Kavanaugh and California professor Christine Blasey Ford were questioned about Ford’s accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while the two were in high school. The Judiciary Committee approved the candidate after tense debate Friday for a full Senate vote, but that vote will be delayed up to one week to allow for an FBI investigation. At the PACE event, students from political groups on campus were invited to speak first, including leaders from IU College Democrats, Young Americans for Liberty and the Young Democratic Socialists of America.Davis said she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s views on immigration, same sex marriage, gerrymandering, voter ID laws, the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade. She said his views threaten the human rights of many, especially immigrants, the LGBT community and women.“Even if you don’t believe women, you still have a thousand reasons to vote no,” Davis said.Rishi Raman, leader of the Young Democratic Socialists of America, said he was worried the deregulation Kavanaugh supports, such as being against the conservation of wildlife, could harm the environment. He said he also doesn’t like Kavanaugh’s past support of large corporations over workers’ rights.Davis also talked about how Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh made it even more clear that Kavanaugh is not fit to serve as a Supreme Court justice.“It has to be relevant to his appointment because it affects the ability of him to do his job,” Davis said.In the eyes of senior Parker Zent, Thursday’s hearings on U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh were alarmingly politicized and reactions were extreme.“I can’t get over how we talk about this,” Zent said. “So many people have called Kavanaugh a terrible man and Ford very bad names as well. I’m scared that there are people that don’t care about the stories of these two people. They just want their side to win.”Carl Weinberg, senior lecturer in the College of Arts and Sciences and moderator of the discussion, said watching Kavanaugh being questioned on things written in his high school yearbook made him think about the implications down the road for other officials who may be put under the microscope.“It made me a little sick to my stomach,” Weinberg said. “The spectacle of someone’s private life being investigated sets a precedent.”',\n",

       "  'body': 'By Sarah D. Wire, Jennifer Haberkorn, David Lauter and David G. SavageLos Angeles TimesWASHINGTON — Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh and his friend of sexually assaulting her in high school, said Thursday that what she remembers most is the laughing.Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that a drunken Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, locked her in a bedroom during a 1982 party and tried to rape her.When asked about her most indelible memory, Ford recalled the \"uproarious laughter between the two, and their having fun at my expense.\" She told the senators she was \"100 percent\" certain Kavanaugh was her attacker.Both Kavanaugh and Judge have denied the allegations.Echoing now-Justice Clarence Thomas\\' condemnation of the \"high-tech lynching\" he said he had endured during his 1991 confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh called what has happened to him a \"national disgrace.\"It was a surprisingly raw display of rage and passion for a judicial nominee, but his supporters said it reflected the heartfelt frustration of a man who thinks he\\'s been wrongly accused. \"He\\'s righteously incensed, and I don\\'t blame him,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.Kavanaugh\\'s sharp partisan complaints were also highly unusual for a Supreme Court candidate. He accused Democrats of \"lying in wait\" to attack him, frequently interrupted and mocked Democratic senators during questioning and attributed his treatment to \"revenge on the behalf of the Clintons.\" Kavanaugh is a longtime GOP attorney who worked with special counsel Kenneth Starr to investigate former President Bill Clinton.Noting the Senate\\'s role in the process of confirming Supreme Court nominees, he said Democrats \"have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy.\"Marc Short, the former White House liaison to Congress, predicted that Kavanaugh\\'s impassioned testimony would help him win confirmation along party lines.President Donald Trump was glued to the television and heartened by the fiery testimony, aides said. One senior administration official involved in the confirmation process described Kavanaugh\\'s performance as \"powerful ... strong ... game changing\" in a text message.The president was \"happier\" to see Kavanaugh defending himself so strongly, another administration official said, as Trump counseled Kavanaugh to do earlier in the week after the nominee and his wife appeared on Fox News.Even as administration officials and allies sought to circle the wagons around the embattled nominee, the aide said that Trump was \"waiting until it\\'s over\" to assess the viability of his eventual confirmation.The highly anticipated showdown between Ford and Kavanaugh has upended the plans of Senate Republicans, who, clinging to a narrow majority, hoped to swiftly confirm a staunchly conservative jurist for a lifetime seat on the high court.Democrats praised Ford for sharing her story. \"You have given America an amazing teaching moment,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, told Ford, causing her to choke back tears.Ford\\'s combination of emotional fragility — evident in her face and voice — and her precise recall of certain facts and details made the California professor a powerful witness. She had not been seen or heard in public since her story gained the national spotlight two weeks ago.Ford also described the harassment, death threats and other blowback she has endured since coming forward. \"I am here not because I want to be,\" she told the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"I\\'m terrified.\"She emphasized that she had originally reported the alleged incident to Democratic lawmakers before Kavanaugh was selected by Trump and denied having any political motivations.As Ford testified, her training as a research psychologist periodically became obvious. Asked by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, about the impact that the alleged attack had on her life, Ford referred to the \"sequelae\" of the attack, a psychology term that refers to the symptoms that can follow a traumatic event. Ford has a doctorate in educational psychology from the University of Southern California.The sequelae of sexual assault vary from victim to victim, she noted, adding that in her case, she had suffered from \"PTSD-like\" symptoms, including claustrophobia.Later, Feinstein asked how she could be sure that it was Kavanaugh who had put his hand over her mouth to prevent her from screaming.\"The same way that I\\'m sure that I\\'m talking to you right now,\" she responded. \"Basic memory function.\"Ford went on to refer to the way neurotransmitters in the brain record memories in the hippocampus, a portion of the brain that plays a central role in human memory.But her responses were not entirely clinical. Asked by Feinstein if there was a possibility that this could be a case of \"mistaken identity,\" Ford\\'s response was simple.\"Absolutely not.\"At times Ford\\'s California informality, nervousness and lack of experience in public speaking contrasted sharply with the usual stiffness of Senate proceedings in Washington. She joked about needing caffeine, referred to childhood \"beach friends,\" spoke of her fear of flying and often took deep breaths. At one point she drew sympathetic laughter when she asked for the definition of \"exculpatory evidence.\"She said events regarding her coming forward publicly unfolded so quickly this summer that she was interviewing potential attorneys from her car in a Walgreens parking lot while on vacation.Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the committee, opened the hearing by apologizing to both Kavanaugh and Ford for the intense media scrutiny and threats they\\'ve had to endure. He also called on fellow members to maintain civility, but then launched into a partisan attack on how Democrats handled the allegations, which became public days before the committee planned to vote on Kavanaugh.Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, defended her actions, saying she kept the allegations confidential at the request of Ford. In her opening statement, Ford thanked Feinstein for her discretion.\"Sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public.\"Some of the most impassioned comments came from the senators themselves, particularly Republicans, who compared Democrats\\' efforts to question Kavanaugh about Ford\\'s allegations to the anti-communist McCarthy hearings in the 1950s. \"This is the most unethical sham since I\\'ve been in politics,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.The committee has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, and the Republican majority — all of whom are men — recruited Rachel Mitchell, a sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona, to conduct the questioning for them. GOP leaders were anxious to avoid the optics of older, all-male senators grilling Ford, as occurred during the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearing in 1991.Mitchell\\'s questioning of Ford was limited to five-minute segments, since she was effectively filling the time afforded to Republican members of the committee. As a result, she frequently had to interrupt her examination, sometimes in the middle of question, to allow a Democratic lawmaker a turn to ask questions for five minutes.Mitchell focused largely on exploring how Ford decided to go public with her story, who paid for her polygraph test, who recommended potential attorneys and other details that might bolster Republicans\\' claims that Ford is being manipulated by Democrats for political purposes.But conservative television commentators voiced frustration that Mitchell wasn\\'t able to undermine Ford\\'s story, and after Kavanaugh began to testify, Mitchell was largely shunted to the sidelines as Republican senators took over the questioning.During a break in Ford\\'s testimony, some Republican lawmakers\\' comments inadvertently demonstrated why GOP leaders opted to leave the questioning of Ford to Mitchell.Asked if he found Ford credible, Hatch said, \"I think she\\'s an attractive, good witness.\" Asked to clarify what he meant by attractive, Hatch added, \"In other words, she is pleasing.\"Later, Graham said he felt \"ambushed\" by the way the assault allegations were raised so late in the confirmation process, a poor word choice given Ford\\'s allegation of attempt rape.But generally there were stark differences between the examinations of Ford and Hill, who endured relentless questioning from Republican senators. The late Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania accused Hill of committing \"flat-out perjury\" in her claim that Thomas had sexually harassed her at work.In the past week, two other women have come forward to lodge similar allegations against Kavanaugh that involve heavy drinking and abusive behavior. Deborah Ramirez told The New Yorker of a humiliating sexual incident when she was a freshman at Yale and joined a drinking game with several others, including Kavanaugh. On Wednesday, Julie Swetnick filed a sworn declaration in which she recalled being at several parties where Kavanaugh and Judge were drunk and abused young women who were also drunk.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Resources for reporting sexual assault If you believe you have experienced sexual assault, you have options. Any IU employee can help you find the appropriate administrator or faculty member to begin the University reporting process. Keep in mind that most IU employees are considered “responsible employees,” meaning they are required to pass along anything shared with them regarding sexual assault to IU’s Title IX coordinator or a deputy Title IX coordinator who may decide to open a University investigation.If you would like to talk to someone before deciding whether to report, IU has several “confidential employees” with whom you can speak. These employees include those designated as confidential victim advocates within IU’s new Office of Sexual Violence Prevention and Victim Advocacy, mental health counselors at Counseling and Psychological Services and employees at the IU Health Center.Non-University affiliated organizations like the Monroe County Protective Order Assistance Partnership and Middle Way House can also provide resources independent from a university investigation.If you do not wish to start a police investigation, you should know that reports to the University are rarely referred to campus police. If you would like to pursue an investigation in the criminal justice system, you can file a police report with campus or local police. This starts an investigation independent of IU’s Office of Student Conduct, but you should take note that Indiana University Police often refer their cases to the IU Office of Student Conduct for a simultaneous University investigation.Call 911 in an emergency.Bloomington Police Department – 220 E.

       "  'body': 'The situation with Brett Kavanaugh changes so often that CNN has a live-feed dedicated to documenting the most recent information. With the vote happening Friday, allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate are at the forefront of the conversation.In response to these accusations, CNN interviewed Republican women in Florida about their take on the situation. These women essentially said Kavanaugh may have done what he is accused of, but it does not matter. “Tell me what boy hasn’t done this in high school,\" one woman even goes as far as to say.The issue with statements such as these is much deeper than whether or not Kavanaugh is guilty. The issue is that even if he did commit these acts of sexual assault, many are willing to just forget about it. We cannot dismiss a woman’s experiences, and we certainly cannot allow society to think that “boys” committing sexual assault is excusable and even normal and acceptable.People may say that the accuser must be lying about being sexually assaulted because they were drunk. Next, they will say that the assailant is completely innocent because he or she were drunk. This double standard protects assailants if they are drunk and places blame on the person being assaulted if they are.There is this idea that men cannot control themselves, so, if they sexually assault someone, it must be the other person’s fault. The person who was assaulted must have been dressed promiscuously or must look older than her age. If the assaulter is actually found guilty, he can evade punishment just because the judge thinks he has a bright future, like Brock Turner. Those who make the rules of our society consistently view sexual assault as less serious than it is, and those who commit it are able to easily forget about it, while those who were assaulted have to walk the long road to recovery.Sexual assault, despite what many may think, is not normal male behavior. Spreading the belief that it is normal, however, can make that come to fruition. Young, impressionable children will hear that it is normal for men to inappropriately touch women, and both boys and girls will absorb this belief. Girls will think that it is normal to be assaulted, and boys will think that their actions do not have consequences.Whether you believe Kavanaugh or you believe his accusers, the conversation behind this situation must change. People should take the accusations seriously and not just ignore them because they do not think they matter even if they are true. If Kavanaugh is guilty, he must be held accountable because this is not normal male behavior. It is the behavior of a predator. It is a crime and must be punished. ',\n",

       "  'body': 'As Rachel Nichols opened her Sept. 19 interview with Mark Cuban on ESPN’s NBA program “The Jump,” the mercurial Mavericks owner literally sat on the edge of his seat.Nervously sipping from a mug, Cuban appeared tense — almost cowering in his chair. His torso leaned over the glass table where he and Nichols sat.Never one to mince words, this was a Mark Cuban I had not seen before. The bashful billionaire was visibly in a bind.“You run an NBA franchise where you\\'ve talked a lot publicly about how you know everything that goes on there,” Nichols began. “You did know of a few of these isolated incidents.\" \"But even the best-case scenario of you not knowing, the best version of it is that women in your office felt unsafe coming to work. That they made official complaints to human resources, that they were threatened, they were not promoted. If you just didn\\'t know any of this, how do you explain that?”For context, Nichols was referring to whether Cuban knew of former marketing and game operations employee Melissa Weishaupt’s claims of rampant sexual abuse and harassment by ex-Mavs CEO Terdema Ussery released by Sports Illustrated in a first-person essay March 20.Over the course of the nearly seven minute segment, Cuban pled ignorance — seemingly a given for anyone involved in sexual harassment or assault claims these days. And like those before him, it didn’t help his case.Perhaps most jarring was when Nichols revealed one of Ussery’s perceived victims came into the office with visible bruising.“Young African American man, it’s 2014, and I had a decision to make,” Cuban said. “The decision was do I just fire him? My fear in that if I just say ‘Hey you’re fired,’ what’s he going to do next? And what happens to the next person?”To recap, Cuban justified his decision to not fire Ussery after what — based on Sports Illustrated’s reporting — appeared to be blatant acts of domestic abuse because he was worried Ussery\\'s life would be ruined because he was a “young African American man.”I’ll admit the race concern here is valid, but that’s beside the point.Nichols later arrived at the accusations Ussery was watching pornography on his computer at work. Through the investigation it was documented Cuban knew of these allegations and threatened to fire him.However, there was ultimately no follow up from the Mavericks’ owner after his initial threat.“Well, I got reports back saying he was on probation and that he was being dealt with,” Cuban remarked. “So I just assumed it was being dealt with. I didn\\'t have any reason to think otherwise.”Thus, we’ve arrived at the crux of the issue — taking people’s word at what it is.A few weeks back, I read Bowen McCoy’s 1997 story in the Harvard Business Review entitled “The Parable of the Sadhu.” McCoy’s piece chronicled his months long trek through the Nepalese Himalayas. Midway through their expedition, the former president and chairman of Morgan Stanley and his hiking party came across an Indian holy man, or Sadhu.Shivering in the cold with little-to-no clothing, the Sadhu man hinged between life and death. In response, each of the various parties offered little things – a coat, food, drink, etc. – yet no one was willing to take the ultimate plight and help the man down the mountain.McCoy posited this as an existential question as to why humans are unwilling to take full responsibility.Over the past decade, countless examples of sexual violence and harassment have been exacerbated by a lack of accountability.At Penn State, former head football coach Joe Paterno was alerted to claims of child sex abuse against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. So too was university president Graham Spanier and athletic director Tim Curley. Sandusky was reprimanded, but never fired. In October 2012, he was sentenced to between 30 and 60 years in prison for the sexual assault of 10 boys.Just a few weeks ago, Ohio State head football coach Urban Meyer was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season because he turned a blind eye to domestic assault allegations against former wide receivers coach Zach Smith.After his initial remarks to the media, Meyer stated in an interview with ESPN’s Tom Rinaldi his fault was taking the word of others and not asking more questions.Case. In. Point.As evidenced, the dilemma of the Sadhu is an almost identical moral controversy to those of the recently surfaced sexual misconduct claims in the sports world.Of course, the other issue at hand is when one is put in this situation, how would you act? The easy answer is that you would help the Sadhu, or the woman making her claims. But as recent history shows, morality doesn’t reign supreme when it comes to sports.',\n",

       "  'body': \"Clad in black, a group of women and a few men stood under umbrellas and a dreary sky in an open oval near the edge of Third Street Park.Debra Morrow, executive director of Middle Way House, spoke to the crowd before leading a moment of silence for survivors. “It’s 2018, folks,” Morrow told the crowd, her voice shaking. “Survivors of sexual assault should not have to defend their actions.”About 25 people gathered in the pouring rain midday Monday, standing in solidarity with survivors of sexual assault.Time’s Up, a national advocacy group against sexual harassment, organized the national walkout with the hashtag #BelieveSurvivors as a display of solidarity with Christine Blasey Ford, who came forward with allegations of sexual assault against her high school classmate and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last Sunday. Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh's Yale classmate, shared her own allegations one week later. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. The Bloomington event was led by the Middle Way House, a domestic violence and sexual assault support center.In an echo of the #MeToo movement, #WhyIDidntReport flooded social media Friday afternoon. Morrow shared the sadness and inspiration she felt upon watching people come forward through their posts.In a moment of bravery, Morrow created a Twitter account. In another moment of bravery, she wrote her first tweet:“Because I was nine years old,” she wrote. “He was my priest. And I thought I would go to hell.”Quickly, she found herself reliving the blame and the shame she felt 28 years ago. She hid the tweet from public view within an hour.“To this day, I still live with the fear of consequences and disclosure, even though I know it was not my fault,” Morrow said.A couple of other women shared their stories after a moment of silence. Sarah Hunt, outreach communications coordinator for the Middle Way House, was in her 30s. She first told a friend, who asked if she was sure she understood what she was saying, if she was sure she understood what really happened.“That really affirmed to me, and informed me, how I was going to move forward,” Hunt said. She didn’t feel the need to report what happened. She didn't anticipate saying anything at the walkout Monday, either.“It wasn’t going to change what happened,” Hunt said. The Middle Way House provides a safe space for people to reach out for support without being instructed whether or not to report, she said. Many survivors who have gone through the criminal justice process tell Hunt they have found it more painful than the actual experience. Hunt supports those who choose to share their stories, but said she understands why they might refrain.“They have nothing to gain from doing so, and everything to lose,” Hunt said. About two out of every three sexual assaults go unreported, according to the 2015 National Crime Victimization survey.Morrow said anytime a survivor’s credibility is publicly challenged there is a huge effect on others trying to gather the courage to share their own stories.“Enough is enough,” Morrow said. She urged the crowd to contact Sen. Joe Donnelly, D-Indiana, and Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana. Let them know what you want from them and tell them you believe survivors, she said.Bloomington resident Margaret Clements said she has been living the #MeToo movement her whole life. She said she doesn’t think Kavanaugh deserves a gavel or a robe. “I believe the survivors,” Clements said. \",\n",

       "  'body': \"Last month, IU released a statement that sophomore running back Morgan Ellison has been indefinitely suspended from all football activities. However, the University refuses to say anything else about the matter. IU is not exactly known for its great communication and student body safety, so while this doesn’t come as a surprise, the editorial board feels that IU needs to be completely transparent about disciplinary measures taken.In the past, when IU has suspended athletes, press releases often included the reasoning, be it alcohol, drugs or misconduct. So when IU indefinitely suspends a player and refuses to say why, red flags are raised.If IU had no issue releasing names and facts related to other players’ suspensions in the past, they cannot suddenly pass it off as a respect of privacy for Morgan Ellison. More so, the University ought to care about public safety of its student body more than it does about its reputation.Last year when IU indefinitely suspended Jordan Fuchs, they disclosed that it was a positive test for anabolic steroids. If IU is open about its prime athletes being booted for drugs, there should be no reason to suddenly clam up about this instance.When news like this breaks, people usually assume the worst. Since IU will not release if this suspension was academic, drugs or drinking, it gives the uneasy feeling that it might be something more criminal.In any case, IU is doing no favors to its reputation, its student body or its athletes. If Ellison truly was not involved in anything more illicit than drinking or doing drugs, IU is dragging his name through the mud by not disclosing the reason for his dismissal. And if the suspension was punishment for some other behavior, not disclosing that information creates a hazard to public safety. Without assuming anything about Ellison, we separately know that IU’s policies for sexual assault and Title IX are less than optimal.The Indiana Daily Student conducted a yearlong investigation into IU's sexual assault policies entitled The System, where more of this information can be found. Separate from this issue of suspension, we have seen that students have felt unsafe at the school due to the University's lack of transparency and cooperation with its students, specifically regarding sexual assault allegations and compliance with Title IX. Although IU has issued several formal statements condemning the acts of sexual assault, its actions leave much to be desired. Just this past summer, IU student Ellie Johnson took to social media leading a campaign against the University after she felt it violated her Title IX rights.Johnson’s story is among many others at IU, even for those who have not filed formal complaints. She organized the Shatter the Silence march, where about 100 students gathered in hopes of changing the way IU handles cases of sexual violence.IU has received four separate complaints since 2014 about its Title IX practices which resulted in the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights investigating it. Although the university was cleared of all four complaints, that doesn’t erase the University’s past, or the fact that some students still think that these cases were mishandled.There is also the question of IU Athletics in general. IU made the decision in 2017 to ban any athletes with a history of sexual or domestic violence, but this refers to students who have been convicted of these crimes, as opposed to those who have been accused.In 2017, IU basketball alone made a revenue of almost $24 million. The total revenue for IU athletics was $106,139,192. Naturally, athletics are important here. It is easy to assume the school wants to protect the reputation of its athletic program, even if it comes at the cost of the reputations of the athletes.IU athletes have been suspended for sexual violence and misconduct in the past. In 2016, football player Kiante Ellis was arrested for child molestation and immediately dropped from the team. In this case, since he was arrested, the information was released immediately by the sheriff's department and many outside news sources.If the student athlete in question is not arrested, perhaps it is impossible to find these details of what really happened.We know that IU seldom chooses to divulge details that could tarnish its name and reputation, but this institution should consider making its student body a priority rather than the University's appearance. There is a big difference between a student being suspended for a harmless infraction and endangering other students. In the event that Ellison’s suspension was related to something more serious than run of the mill misconduct, not only is IU protecting its reputation, it appears that it is also treating its athletes with special privilege due to their pseudo-public figure status.  If the suspension is the result of common misconduct that does not endanger anyone else, then the University has a duty to put its student body at ease.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'There is perhaps no more vital film for our time than Michael Mann’s 1999 drama “The Insider,” a film as much about a team of CBS \"60 Minutes\" journalists as it is about the vitality of truth and the cost of doing the right thing. Adapted from the Vanity Fair article \"The Man Who Knew Too Much,\" about Big Tobacco whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand’s exposé of the industry’s knowledge of tobacco’s health risks, “The Insider” is as taut and viscerally compelling as anything in Mann’s oeuvre.And in a day and age where Christine Blasey Ford, who came forward this week with sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh, did so knowing full well it would jeopardize her livelihood, her safety and her public image, “The Insider” is more than just a thrilling true story drama; it’s a chilling and haunting reminder that the silence breaker is the truest hero. It’s so excellent because, like the best of Mann’s works, it’s so deeply concerned with the struggles of the common man. He’s both a deeply empathetic filmmaker and a patient one, willing to explore the personal toils of his characters and foster for the viewer an understanding that runs deeper than surface level. His works are soulful, poetic and meditative — he deifies the common man, but also understands him, finds what makes him fundamentally human and reduces him to that so we may understand him.“The Insider” is as much a film about investigative journalism as it is about the struggles of fathers and the weight of its characters’ ethical dilemmas against their personal lives.That results in a number of haunting, even frightening sequences, perhaps the most stunning of which comes late in the film as Al Pacino’s character, Lowell Bergman, attempts to talk Wigand down from suicide. Both actors’ performances are exceptional, lending the scene a gravitas and honesty that is at once heartrending and devastating, but even more effective is Mann’s filmmaking.As Wigand sits alone in a hotel room, contemplating the losses he’s sustained in his effort to tell the truth, the image morphs into a domestic scene, grounding the viewer firmly in the character’s perspective and visually juxtaposing a dissonance between worlds.“The Insider” is a triumphant film, but also a tragic one. That dissonance between worlds becomes the core turmoil of the film, and a source of the characters’ suffering as they fight to tell the truth.Mann front-loads the film with scenes of Wigand’s home life, asserting him as fatherly and compassionate, and back-loads it with reminders that such things won’t survive the hero’s quest to bring out the truth. It’s a mournful film, shot with a camera that lingers on its characters’ sorrows and follows them – literally, it glides through the film’s largely domestic mise-en-scène like a member of the film – through every trepidation and scored with orchestral compositions that exude melancholy and bleed sorrow.Mann’s film was released in 1999, but its themes are timeless. It’s about journalism and the power of truth, but also the deeply heroic act of telling the truth and the unfathomable courage it takes to do the right thing when only the bad people ever seem to win.As Pacino says in one of the film’s – and perhaps cinema as a whole’s – greatest scenes, “I’m running out of heroes, man.” In a worse film, and perhaps in any other director’s rendering of this story, the journalist might be the hero, but to Mann, it’s the ordinary person doing the honorable thing. The journalists are just there to listen.',\n",

       "  'body': \"Activists hung a banner on the walls of the Monroe County Courthouse encouraging people to call their senators and urge them to vote no for Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination.The protest was organized by students and local activist groups, and featured speakers discussing Kavanaugh’s views on health care and women’s rights. Later, protesters passed out buttons, flyers and signs with sayings like “Why we say KavaNOPE” and “Protect Health Care” on Kirkwood Avenue. The protest comes after the Senate postponed their vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination following Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her at a house party when he was 17. Kavanaugh denied the allegation.The Senate’s meeting to vote on Kavanaugh was scheduled for Thursday but was postponed amid the allegation. The Senate Judiciary Committee said it will hold a public hearing with Kavanaugh about the allegations next week. Blasey Ford is currently in negotiations to speak before the committee. Students on campus are concerned about the allegation and what it could mean in the future, College Democrats at IU President Raegan Davis said.“We are trying to draw the connection between how he treats women outside the courtroom and how he would treat them in the courtroom,” Davis said. In addition to women’s rights, protesters said they are concerned with Kavanaugh’s views on health care. Protester Bryce Greene spoke to the crowd of around 30 people on how Kavanaugh’s appointment could affect health care.In the past, Kavanaugh has received criticism from abortion-rights activists for calling contraceptives abortion-inducing drugs. In 2017, Kavanaugh was a judge on a case to determine whether or not an immigrant teen could receive an abortion and dissented. “Kavanaugh seems to be all right with people going bankrupt over medical bills,” Greene said. “He is not on anyone’s side.”Green said Kavanaugh does not have an open mind toward progressive views, something he said he does not want in the Supreme Court.“I don’t think we need any more conservatives in the Court,” Greene said. “We have a Supreme Court now that is hostile towards progressive views, and that hurts progressive people everywhere.”Goals of the protest were to discuss broader issues and concerns of protesters, and using Kavanaugh’s nomination as a way to get people involved in them, Davis said.“The Kavanaugh question represents a lot of bigger issues,” Davis said. “We are advocating through his lense because he is the most immediate threat.”Organizers said they felt that a gathering of protesters would be the most effective strategy to create change because officials are more likely to listen to a collective voice.“Protest is a form of political communication that is likely to get the attention of elected officials,” Davis said. “If you call, that is just one person.”Bloomington Mayor John Hamilton attended, and he said he was happy to see citizens standing up for their beliefs.“I am always proud to see that Bloomington is full of activists,” Hamilton said. “That is how change happens. If you don’t fight, you’re not going to win.”\",\n",

       "  'body': 'It can be hard for students struggling with addiction or working on recovery to be sober in college, especially between tailgating, parties and turning 21.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 2017 report by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, one in five college students reported extreme binge drinking or having 15 or more alcoholic drinks in a row in the two weeks prior to the survey. By their late 20s, 64 percent of young adults have tried an illicit drug and 37 percent have tried an illicit drug other than marijuana.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can be especially hard to be sober at IU. The school ranking website Niche named it the number one party school in Indiana and number seven in the United States for 2019. Last year, police handed out 102 drinking tickets during Little 500 weekend, although this number was down from 166 the year before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAddiction can affect anyone, no matter his or her age, gender, race, sexuality or economic status. Rapper Mac Miller, 26, died more than a week ago from a suspected drug overdose after a long struggle with alcohol and drug addictions. In light of this news, here are some on- and off-campus resources for students struggling with addiction. Counseling and Psychological Services\\r\\n\\r\\nCAPS is the IU Health Center’s counseling wing. It offers both individual and group counseling sessions, as well as psychiatric care and sexual assault crisis services. It also offers over-the-phone consultations for people concerned about a family member, student or friend. For students who have paid the IU Health Fee, the first two visits to the center are free. Additional visits cost $35 per individual session, and between $15 and $17 per person per group session depending on the length of the session. Students may be able to get sessions reimbursed, depending on their insurance.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents in Recovery — Bloomington\\r\\n\\r\\nSIRB is a student organization formed in 2015 for students in addiction recovery at IU. The group conducts weekly meetings at the Indiana Memorial Union and has office hours throughout the week in the IMU student activities tower. The group welcomes students recovering from alcohol and drug addiction as well as eating disorders and other mental health conditions.OASIS\\r\\n\\r\\nOASIS is IU’s alcohol and drug information center, which provides counseling, programming assistance and data on drugs and alcohol to the campus and the Bloomington community.OASIS’s Journey Program is a brief intervention strategy for students that includes individual and group sessions. Students referred to OASIS by the student ethics office following a drug or alcohol charge must pay $200 per referral. All other students pay $30 per session.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous are free group meetings for people interested in overcoming drug or alcohol addiction. Meetings occur every day of the week and the groups’ calendars are consistently updated online. Some meetings are open to anyone interested in the programs, including people who don’t suffer from addiction, while closed meetings are only for people in recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecovery Engagement CenterThe Recovery Engagement Center is a walk-in center created by Centerstone, a nonprofit health care organization that provides mental health and substance use treatment. The REC is a low-barrier community center run by volunteers, which means anyone who walks in can receive help. REC provides resources for people interested in recovery and has no expectation of sobriety. ',\n",

       "  'body': 'Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will publish new policies for handling sexual misconduct on college campuses, according to an Aug. 29 New York Time article. Since the rules are not published yet, it is unclear what the effects would be for IU.  “Our existing processes we feel are sound, and for the most part, we’re hopeful no significant overhaul needs to be happening,” said Emily Springston, University Director of Institutional Equity & Title IX.”The new rules will narrow the definition of sexual harassment, hold schools accountable only if the complaints are filed properly and establish a higher standard to assess how universities handle complaints, according to the New York Times.  The policies would preserve the majority of Title IX laws, according to the article. Included in proposed changes are the strengthening of rights of those accused of sexual misconduct, reduced liability for the university and encouragement for more victim support. Springston said the Office of Institutional Equity is in a “wait and see” phase. “So we can’t say one way or another whether things would significantly change,” Springston said. “We’re committed to making sure that whatever it is, that our policy is still able to provide the resources, the support, the processes that are appropriate as we see them.” IU has recently received criticism for the way it handles sexual assault cases. Students marched through campus in August as a part of the Shatter the Silence march and rally. The protest was meant to raise awareness for sexual violence on IU’s campus and to demand action from the University. IU offers support for victims through the IU Health Center, Sexual Assault Crisis Services and Confidential Victim Advocates, a program which helps students who have experienced sexual assault, harassment, relationship violence, stalking or other threats to their personal safety. These services, with the exception of Sexual Assault Crisis Services, are funded by a grant IU receives from the State Department of Health for rape prevention efforts. Sexual Assault Crisis Services is largely funded by the Student Health Fee. A previous version of this story incorrectly included Sexual Assault Crisis Services as a program funded by a grant IU receives from the State Department of Health.

       "  'body': 'The man connected with a string of burglaries and rapes from September 2016 on the southeast side of Bloomington is set to be sentenced Tuesday. Devin Grounds was charged with multiple felony counts of rape, burglary and theft. Grounds pleaded guilty May 2 to one rape charge. Five break-ins were reported on the south side of IU’s campus the mornings of Sept. 5 and Sept. 8, 2016, between 2 and 6 a.m. Female residents reported attempted assault in two cases and rape in another. At least one of the victims was an IU student at the time. In four of the break-ins, residents described the intruder as a masked man. Grounds fled when the women in these four cases confronted or fought him. Bloomington Police Department identified Grounds as a suspect in all five cases based on matching descriptions from victims and DNA evidence. In the North Walnut Street case, the woman reported being woken up around 5 a.m. by a man who threatened to kill her if she didn’t do as he said. The man then tied the woman’s hands behind her back and raped her, she said. He untied her before fleeing the apartment, and possibly stealing her iPhone. The phone was never found. The woman later completed a sexual assault evidence kit at the hospital. Detectives used this evidence, as well as a cup from her home the man reportedly touched, to match Grounds to the crime scene. Police also found Grounds’ DNA in the break-in on the 400 block of East Melrose Avenue, where a 22-year-old woman reported waking up to see a masked man beside her bed. In the South Henderson Street case, the first of the five break-ins, a 20-year-old woman reported waking up on her couch at about 5 a.m. Sept. 5 when she felt a man touching her knee. The man told her to take off her clothes, she said, but fled when she attempted to pull off his mask.In the East Second Street case, a 20-year-old woman reportedly awoke at 2:15 a.m. Sept. 8 to see a masked man standing above her. He threatened to kill her unless she took off her clothes, she said. When he attempted to take off her clothes, she screamed and fought back, and he fled.Then, at about 5 a.m., a 33-year-old woman on the 1300 block of South Washington Street reported waking up to hear her dog barking and finding a masked man outside her bedroom door. The man fled.',\n",

A plastic pink lei was wrapped around the wooden stick that held it. “So glad my sister doesn’t go here,” it read. This was just one of many posters at the Shatter the Silence march and rally, a protest to raise awareness for sexual violence on IU’s campus and to demand action from the University. The crowd of around 100 people wore white T-shirts with teal ribbons printed on them, the symbol for sexual assault awareness, and the words “Shatter the Silence” written in script.The group marched about a mile and a half chanting “No more violence, shatter the silence” and “Me too, IU. Shame on you, IU.” Once they arrived at Dunn Meadow, Ellie Johnson, one of the two organizers of the event, spoke along with the IUSA chief of staff and two survivors. “It’s unfortunate we have to beg for our rights, but here we are,” Johnson said to the crowd.IU spokesman Chuck Carney said the University appreciates students\\' attention to these matters and support their efforts to speak out.\"We stand behind our processes which are fair, thorough, and equitable for all students,\" Carney said. \"In orientation, later on arrival to campus and again in their first year, IU students participate in programming that addresses sexual assault education. IU will continue to lead in educating all students on matters of sexual assault prevention.\"Johnson, a survivor, went viral in June after calling out IU’s sexual violence policies on Twitter. The post gained over 2,000 retweets and 5,000 likes and prompted a response from the University. I was raped and @IUBloomington said to my rapist \"Yes, what you did to her was okay.\" I had a preponderance of evidence and the panelists established I was drunk. What about your policy \"drunk consent is not consent?\" More so, they violated Title IX multiple times with me.Some social media posts also featured Johnson naming the panelists involved with her case and their contact and personal information. On July 10, Johnson posted on Twitter she filed a Title IX complaint with the Office of Civil Rights, a sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Education.     At the rally, Celeste Coughlin, another organizer, read from a letter written by the organizers calling for IU to publicly recognize sexual violence as an issue at the University, explain how they will hold sexual predators accountable, meet the needs of survivors and issue a statement of support and commitment to survivors. “We deserve a system that handles sexual violence as seriously as it handles plagiarism,” Coughlin read from the letter.They intend to turn the letter in Monday, Johnson said, and encouraged people to sign it at the rally.IUSA Chief of Staff Isabel Mishkin said her administration wants to learn more about sexual violence on IU’s campus and make sure the University is truly supporting survivors. She wants students to have a seat at the table when IU handles this issue.“The best decisions that happen at IU are the ones that include students,” Mishkin said.IUSA’s President Alex Wisniewski participated in the rally, too, holding a sign that read “Shatter the Silence.”The next speaker, junior Hannah Patton, talked about a loophole in IU’s investigations. Her alleged attacker transferred schools during his investigation. He faced no consequences and is a member of a fraternity at a different school, she said.“He has the opportunity to do it to someone else,” Patton said.The other survivor, Xakilah Daniel, experienced domestic violence and said she used to blame herself for letting it happen. “I’m no longer a girl that watches her tone or covers her bruises,” Daniel said.She encouraged the crowd to not let sexual violence define them.About 15 men showed up to march, and one of them, freshman Leo Banks, said the gender disparity showed a wider cultural problem.“It’s kinda scary that so many more women are here than men,” he said. “There should be more of us.” Despite all of the support on Saturday, Johnson’s initial tweet wasn’t intended to culminate in a rally. “As I started getting messages after going public and hearing stories about the IU system, I realized these are not isolated instances,” Johnson said.Soon she realized her tweet could turn into a movement.Coughlin, a law and public policy major who handled the logistics of the event, was inspired to get involved because of her interest in grassroots activism.“We’re trying to act in the best interests of the whole student body because the system has been broken for so long,” Coughlin said.Abigail Bridgeman, a junior, didn’t even know Johnson before she saw the viral tweet. But as soon as she saw it, she knew she had to get involved and managed the rally’s social media.“I saw the things she was fighting for and was blown away by her courage,” Bridgeman said. “She lost so much but she’s still fighting.”After the rally, people from all directions swarmed Johnson with hugs and words of support. Her clothes were damp with sweat.“I’m exhausted, out of breath and super sweaty,” Johnson said. “But I’m empowered.”This story has been updated to include a statement from IU spokesman Chuck Carney that was not included in the original version.A previous version of this story incorrectly quoted a protester\\'s sign that said \"So glad my sister doesn\\'t go here.\" The IDS regrets this error.

       "  'body': \"Documentarian Jennifer Fox’s first narrative film, “The Tale,” is and will remain one of the most brave feats of storytelling film industry has seen in a long while.This film is an account of her own experiences with childhood sexual assault and manipulation, and is vital for the #MeToo era. It's a bold, challenging exploration of memory and the processes by which victims struggle to cope with the things they’ve suffered through. Fox’s gut-wrenching and emotionally stirring film takes the viewer through the safety net of false truths she’s built for herself to hide past pains.Laura Dern stars in the film as Fox, a journalist and professor forced to confront past traumas when her mother discovers a story – “The Tale” – she wrote at age 13, detailing a disturbing and illicit sexual relationship she had with two athletic coaches.Fox’s film is a triumph of narrative storytelling because of how deftly she navigates the differences between documentary and narrative film. This is a deeply personal account that's heightened by the extreme sensitivity with which she approaches the difficult topics at hand. Its complexity is further compounded by the empathy she extends to her characters and the means by which she tells the story.An early sequence underlines her preference for visual storytelling and her gut-wrenching approach to the truth: Fox envisions the same sequence twice, depicted before and after a pivotal realization. As Jennifer initially recalls the experiences outlined in her story, we’re shown in flashback the meeting between Jenny – played by Jessica Sarah Flaum, an actress in her teens – and horseback riding and running coaches, and she’s confident. After finding a picture of herself at 13, Fox posits another envisioning of the same sequence mere minutes later, with a substantially younger actress, Isabelle Nélisse in the role. She’s a shy, youthful child. With not a word spoken, Fox has driven home with unforgettable force the idea at the core of this deeply personal story – that there is a dissonance between the truth and the stories we tell ourselves to survive. The rest of the film plays out both as a quest for personal catharsis, which extends well beyond the confines of the film, and for truth, a quest that feels vital in the age of fake news and powerful within the context of the #MeToo movement. It’s also a movie that’s anchored firmly to Fox’s own story. It’s not so much actively political as implicitly significant within a larger context — which is both a testament to the power and bravery of Fox’s willingness to tell her story on such a large-scale platform and a reminder of the importance of listening to the stories of victims. Here is a story with profoundly personal ramifications and concerns severe emotional traumas. Nowhere is Fox demanding anything of audiences but to listen to her. Her documentary roots also feel particularly significant in her work here. The film's innate reliance on truth and empathy are the building blocks and life force of the nonfiction narrative. There’s a compassion to her storytelling, and an earnestness and immediacy to her filmmaking that lends it its searing power.“The Tale” is a movie about truth – about hiding it, hiding from it and, ultimately, confronting it. It’s the perfect encapsulation of a cultural, social and political moment when truth is challenged both as a virtue of everyday life and as a force for equality.With “The Tale,” Jennifer Fox is telling her truth. It’s a powerful, emotionally brutal watch and one that features numerous sequences of blood-boiling, stomach-churning material that’s so deeply disturbing it’s hard to watch. Always, it feels overwhelming, and at times it even feels like too much, but this is Fox’s story to tell. She exhibits the courage to tell it at all and the agency to do so on her own terms, and that is the real triumph.\",\n",

The Australian founder and editor of WikiLeaks has at various times angered the right, the left, the center and an array of world governments.He became a hero to many opponents of the U.S. war machine in 2010 when WikiLeaks published classified materials leaked by Chelsea Manning, a U.S. soldier at the time, exposing shocking and illegal acts carried out by the U.S. military in Iraq.Assange was later idolized by supporters of Donald Trump for publishing hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta.While the reputations of Assange and his organization in the U.S. have been ever-changing, WikiLeaks has been consistent in its advocacy for transparency and freedom of expression.

The official WikiLeaks Twitter account carried out a private conversation via direct message with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 election, showing the organization was perfectly happy to be complicit in the election of Donald Trump, a man with zero positive human traits.However, the issue of how Julian Assange should be treated is not merely an issue of whether he’s a good guy or a bad guy. It’s an issue of press freedom and civil liberties.There have been credible reports in recent days Ecuador may expel Assange from its embassy in London, where Assange has lived in asylum since 2012. The governments of the U.K. and Ecuador say they are in negotiations over Assange’s fate.Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno is clearly unhappy with Assange. Ecuador cut off Assange’s internet access in March after Assange spoke in favor of Catalonian independence from Spain. Spain is a close ally of Ecuador.Assuming Ecuador does expel Assange from its embassy in London, Assange will probably be immediately arrested by U.K. authorities for a minor bail violation — failing to show up in court for a hearing on Sweden’s attempt to extradite him for sexual assault charges that have since been dropped.Once he’s in British custody, the important questions become whether the U.S. will seek to extradite him for publishing classified material, and whether the U.K. will comply.Publishing classified U.S. government secrets, which WikiLeaks has done, is illegal. However, the Justice Department has typically refrained from prosecuting publishers of classified material, only punishing those who leaked the material, because prosecuting the publishers has clear negative implications for press freedom.That’s why former President Barack Obama’s Department of Justice refrained from prosecuting Assange. Since WikiLeaks had only published the material, not leaked it, prosecuting WikiLeaks would have meant also prosecuting the New York Times, the Washington Post and every other U.S. media outlet that has published classified information.There have been indications this may change under the Trump administration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said last year he is considering prosecuting journalists for publishing leaked information. As CIA director in April 2017, Trump’s current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a series of baseless and inane accusations about WikiLeaks, calling it “a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.”It’s not comforting that Pompeo shared and promoted WikiLeaks content on Twitter multiple times during the 2016 election, or that the president himself literally said “I love WikiLeaks” in October 2016. The Trump administration has never been careful to avoid hypocrisy.If the U.S. does successfully extradite and prosecute WikiLeaks for publishing classified material, it will mean every major American newspaper, among many other U.S. media outlets, will be open to prosecution on the same grounds, because they have published classified information.If you think Trump’s mean tweets about CNN are a threat to press freedom, know the prospect of prosecuting Assange is much worse.Ultimately, Congress should repeal or amend the law making it illegal to publish classified information. But even while that law exists, the Department of Justice should follow the convention of respecting press freedom by refraining from prosecuting media outlets, of which WikiLeaks is one, for what they publish.Given the U.S. government’s explicit threats against WikiLeaks and the U.K. government’s subservience to the U.S., things are not looking good.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Following social media posts critical of IU\\'s sexual assault policies, as well as posts stating the University violated Title IX while investigating her case, an IU student will no longer work as an RA next school year and has also organized a march and rally to take place during Welcome Week to bring attention to sexual assault on campus.The student, Ellie Johnson, first tweeted about her case June 25. The post now has more than 2,000 retweets and 5,000 favorites. In the weeks following the initial post, a hashtag, #WeStandWithEllie, was created, along with continued social media posts from Johnson and others with regard to the University\\'s procedures in sexual assault cases.Some social media posts also featured Johnson naming the panelists involved with her case and their contact and personal information. On July 10, Johnson posted on Twitter she filed a Title IX complaint with the Office of Civil Rights, a sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Education.  Two days later, Johnson posted on Facebook and Twitter she had been fired from her RA position at the University.Chuck Carney, IU director of media relations, said Johnson was not fired \"in any way\" from her RA position, but instead was offered another on-campus position which was a \"change in responsibilities\" away from the RA position. Carney said the decision was based on statements Johnson made about her ability to fulfill key requirements of the RA role.Later on July 12, Johnson tweeted screenshots of her own tweets, which she said IU used as grounds for firing her. The tweets included Johnson interacting with incoming IU students and their family members about problems with sexual assault at the University.Johnson confirmed to the IDS she had been \"reassigned\" to another on-campus position and had accepted it.In other tweets posted July 12, Johnson said she was told she was \"incapable of performing my duties,\" with regard to being an RA, but she was incapable \"because #IUB isn\\'t giving me the necessary resources to protect my residents.\" She also said she wasn\\'t given any warnings and was incapable of doing her job because of IU\\'s negligence.@IUBloomington just fired me from my RA position. They said I\\'m incapable of performing my duties... I\\'m incapable because #IUB isn\\'t giving me the necessary resources to protect my residents.\"If there’s one thing I want IU to understand, it’s that there are human lives on the verge of death because of their actions,\" Johnson said in a Twitter direct message to the Indiana Daily Student. \"Mine included. We are devastated. We are scared. We are unable to receive our education when there are sexual predators walking around campus and there is a negligent university standing in the way. Indiana University, time is up. Survivors are calling for action. Immediately.\"Johnson said she has filed a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights for retaliation in relation to losing her RA position.\"We support our students’ ability to speak out and say whatever they want,\" Carney said. \"She has every right to say whatever she wants to say. Free speech is an important part of our campus and should be an important part of every campus. This is just something that we felt like in this particular case would be the best thing to do.\"On July 18, Johnson tweeted she would be meeting with Jacqueline Simmons, IU vice president and general counsel, the next day. Then, on July 23, Johnson began to post her takeaways from that meeting on Twitter.Johnson said the meeting was \"a minuscule start,\" and there was an \"extremely long way to go.\"Carney also provided a statement regarding the meeting between Johnson and Simmons.\"Our Vice President and General Counsel Jackie Simmons had a very good and productive meeting with Ms. Johnson to hear many of her concerns and answer her questions,\" Carney wrote in an email to the IDS. \"I know that they intend to continue talking in an upcoming meeting.\"Also on July 23, Johnson posted plans for a \"Shatter The Silence\" march and rally on social media.The event is scheduled to take place Aug. 18, which is the Saturday of Welcome Week. It will start at 5 p.m. with a meet-up at the Office of Student Conduct, before participants will march to President Michael McRobbie\\'s office in Bryan Hall. A rally will then follow in Dunn Meadow.August 18th, 2018 (Saturday of Welcome Week) —\\r\\n\\r\\nMeet at 5 PM @ the Office of Student Conduct.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will be marching to the president\\'s office to #ShatterTheSilence.\\r\\n\\r\\nRally in Dunn Meadow afterward. #TimesUp #IUB #DoBetter #MeToo #SurvivorCulture pic.twitter.com/o0bCPxgvDP\"Our main goal is to bring awareness to the issue of sexual assault on campus and to raise the level of conscientiousness within the community,\" Johnson said. \"Educational programming and peaceful demonstrations will change the way we talk about \\'consent.\\' We encourage IU to do more for their students, and to do more to improve campus safety. We are open and eager to collaborate with university officials whenever they are ready. In the mean time, we will continue the conversation.\"The march also has an event page on Facebook, which says those participating will \"hand deliver our \\'Demand for Action\\' letters to IU President Michael McRobbie’s office in Bryan Hall at the end of the march.\"According to the event page, the rally in Dunn Meadow will feature \"a variety of guest speakers as well as voter registration and sign-up tables for the new Women’s Empowerment group on campus.\"Just a few hours after the announcement of the event, the IU Student Association released statements on its Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages pledging support for the event and for survivors of sexual assault on the IU campus.\"On Saturday, August 18, students will gather to march and show their support for survivors of sexual assault on our campus,\" the statement reads. \"As your student government, we are proud to share we will be walking with them. The rules and procedures surrounding the conduct process, especially involving sexual misconduct, are complex and oftentimes misunderstood. We are committed to working with University officials to not only bring a better awareness of these procedures to all students, but also ensure the process works to protect all survivors.\"In fall 2017, the IDS published \"The System,\" a four-part series offering an in-depth investigation into IU\\'s system of sexual assault reporting.This story will be updated.',\n",

       "  'body': 'An update containing Ellie Johnson\\'s response to this article is included below.The story so farIU has come under fire in the past few weeks as a student\\'s posts about her sexual assault case have gone viral on social media.The student, Ellie Johnson, has posted online the University violated Title IX multiple times while investigating her case. Her first tweet about her case was posted June 25, and has been shared more than 2,000 times and been liked more than 5,000 times, and resulted in the creation of the #WeStandWithEllie hashtag, along with numerous responses and interactions with other Twitter users.Since then, a stream of comments and remarks from Johnson have been attached to different IU social media posts. Speaking of directors, the Director of Student Conduct, Libby Spotts, should be recognized for perpetuating rape culture and enabling my rapist. For someone who oversees the people she does, she needs to #DoBetter. https://t.co/1NPtYLc4WxAs of July 10, Johnson had also posted the contact info, personal information and, in one case, the Facebook profile for the different panelists for her case. In her posts, Johnson said these people destroyed her life and they should be held accountable.Chuck Carney, IU director of media relations, said while the University has no gag order on students like Johnson, there is an expectation the outcome letter students receive will and should remain private.\"There really is no precedent for this,\" Carney said. \"The expectation is that students would not reveal the outcome letter which has the name of the panelists on it.\"Carney explained Johnson\\'s actions might make it harder for IU to find panelists willing to undergo the training and time commitment required for panelists to hear sexual assault cases.At least one person Johnson mentioned, confirmed they had received an email related to Johnson\\'s case and IU\\'s sexual assault procedures in general.Also on July 10, Johnson posted on Twitter that she filed a Title IX complaint with the Office of Civil Rights, which is a sub-agency of the U.S. Department of Education. Just filed my Title IX complaint with the Office of Civil Rights. I hope @IUBloomington is ready to make some big changes. They\\'re coming regardless. #CultureofSexualAssaultIn fall 2017, the IDS published \"The System,\" a four-part series offering an in-depth investigation into IU\\'s extra-judicial process. According to that reporting, hearing panelists are selected based on a list of IU employees who have completed IU\\'s sexual misconduct training. The training is available to faculty and staff across various departments, and no legal expertise or continuing education is required. One panelist must be a student affairs administrator, and each member must complete an annual day-and-a-half-long seminar composed of in-person and online parts, but those are the main components for eligibility on a panel overseeing sexual assault cases.In a series of tweets posted by Johnson since June 25, she said IU violated Title IX and University procedures in her sexual assault case.She said her appeal was denied and IU was \"standing by their original decision.\" Johnson also tweeted she would have been better off not reporting her case to the University, saying \"I could’ve spared myself the heartache, despair and agony knowing the system was against me from the start.\" On the evening of June 26, the University published a response on social media and also provided a fuller statement to the Indiana Daily Student when asked to do so.In the statement provided, Carney reaffirmed the process used by the University in the investigation, as well as IU\\'s commitment to fostering a safe environment for students, faculty and staff.\"A three-person panel, pulled from a pool of faculty and staff who receive extensive training in matters of sexual assault, carefully considered all facts and evidence presented and rendered its decision, which is based on a preponderance of evidence,\" Carney said in the statement. While unable to comment on details of the specific case or on the areas of study for the panelists, Carney confirmed that after the initial investigation, the decision was affirmed in an independent review.Johnson responded to Carney\\'s comments and this story, saying Carney is responsible along with her panelists. She said she expected IU-Bloomington to keep her safe but instead the panelists protected her rapist.Carney said, \"The expectation is that students would not reveal the outcome letter which has the name of the panelists on it.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI expected @IUBloomington to HELP ME and KEEP ME SAFE. Instead, they condoned my rapist\\'s actions. The panelists are responsible for their actions too!! https://t.co/0pPHsNg3nF',\n",

       "  'body': 'UPDATE:The University has responded with another statement after tweets and social media posts continue to critique IU for its handling of sexual assault investigations, especially with regard to Ellie Johnson and the continuing #WeStandWithEllie movement. Original Story:IU has come under fire after tweets from a student about her sexual assault case went viral. The student, Ellie Johnson, posted online the University violated Title IX multiple times while investigating her case. Her first tweet about her case was posted June 25, and has been shared more than 2,000 times and been liked almost 5,000 times, and resulted in the creation of the #WeStandWithEllie hashtag, along with numerous responses and interactions with other Twitter users.I was raped and @IUBloomington said to my rapist \"Yes, what you did to her was okay.\" I had a preponderance of evidence and the panelists established I was drunk. What about your policy \"drunk consent is not consent?\" More so, they violated Title IX multiple times with me.In a series of tweets posted by Johnson since June 25, she said IU violated Title IX and University procedures in her sexual assault case.In a Twitter direct message to IDS reporter Nyssa Kruse, Johnson said she \"filed a complaint, had a hearing, appealed the outcome\" and recently received the appeal outcome.She said her appeal was denied and that IU was \"standing by their original decision.\" She tweeted she hired an attorney to appeal her case, but didn\\'t get a rehearing.Johnson also tweeted June 25 that she emailed more than 10 University officials a month ago about the Title IX violations, and no one had gotten back to her.Later on June 25, Johnson tweeted she got an offer to meet from IU.At one point June 26, Purdue University\\'s Twitter account joined the conversation and began responding to Johnson while IU had yet to do the same.Later that day, Johnson tweeted she would have been better off not reporting her case to the University, saying \"I could’ve spared myself the heartache, despair and agony knowing the system was against me from the start.\" On the evening of June 26, the University published a response on social media and also provided a fuller statement to the Indiana Daily Student when asked to do so.In the statement provided by Chuck Carney, IU director of media relations, he reaffirmed the process used by the University in the investigation, as well as IU\\'s commitment to fostering a safe environment for students, faculty and staff.\"A three-person panel, pulled from a pool of faculty and staff who receive extensive training in matters of sexual assault, carefully considered all facts and evidence presented and rendered its decision, which is based on a preponderance of evidence,\" Carney said in the statement.

She also tweeted this was a new rule established with her, five days before her hearing.Johnson responded to the University\\'s online statement on her Facebook, claiming IU \"completely ignored the issue at hand in their statement and they didn’t provide any specific actions they are taking,\" and the University has \"screwed over HUNDREDS (sic) of survivors for decades.\"She also responded to the University\\'s online statement on Twitter, saying \"IU is trying to reduce this to a single, isolated incident.

       "  'body': \"The U.S. House of Representatives voted last Thursday to mandate a Department of Defense investigation into whether U.S. forces have violated federal law or defense department policy in Yemen.The provision is included as an amendment to the House version of the 2019 defense authorization bill. It’s unknown whether it will be incorporated into the Senate version.The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Ro Khanna, D–California, is a reaction to an Associated Press investigation last year that uncovered the use of torture in a network of 18 secret prisons in Yemen operated by the United Arab Emirates, or in some cases by Yemeni government troops trained and backed by the U.A.E.The U.A.E. is closely allied with the U.S., especially when it comes to the fight against al-Qaeda in Yemen. It is overwhelmingly likely the U.S. has some indirect involvement in this torture, if not direct involvement.Detainees interviewed by the AP said they knew of people being interrogated by Americans. One member of a Yemeni security force told the AP American forces were sometimes in close proximity to torture being carried out. Furthermore, the U.S. actually sends the Emirati and Yemeni forces the questions it wants answered, and the Emirati and Yemeni forces reply with the detainees’ answers, including videos. That means the U.S. is complicit in whatever goes on during those interrogations, whether Americans are in the room or not.The forms of torture exposed by the AP are gruesome. One method, “the grill,” consists of tying the victim to a spit and rotating them over a fire. In addition, detainees testified they had been sexually assaulted, blindfolded for weeks at a time, kept in cramped shipping containers, smeared with feces and frequently beaten.That’s why Khanna's amendment is valuable. Investigating these abuses is the first step to putting an end to them.The amendment rightly demands that whatever report the defense department issues on the subject, if the amendment passes, must be unclassified. It does allow for a classified annex to the report.It’s important not to be overly optimistic about what this amendment would achieve if passed. Internal investigations are of limited value. The Pentagon has hidden torture from the American public before, and may do so again, especially under a president who has openly embraced torture.Also, the defense department could exploit the fact its report would be allowed to include a classified annex to conceal the most damning details.That being said, Khanna’s amendment is a step in the right direction and should be incorporated in the bill’s final version.Beyond that, Congress needs to deal with the issue of U.S. involvement in Yemen in a much broader way.You wouldn’t know it from watching cable news in the U.S., but Yemen is suffering through one of the worst humanitarian crises on Earth. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in April that Yemen is the world’s single worst humanitarian crisis.That crisis includes the worst cholera outbreak in the history of the world, according to the World Health Organization’s data.That’s largely because of the devastating bombing campaign that has been waged since March 2015 by a U.S.-backed coalition led by Saudi Arabia. The coalition has consistently bombed civilian targets and used indiscriminate weapons, and imposed a partial blockade on territory held by the Houthi rebel group.The U.S., under both Obama and Trump, has been deeply involved in abetting the coalition. The U.S. is refueling Saudi planes in the air. Most significantly, the U.S. has armed Saudi Arabia throughout the conflict, selling the theocratic dictatorship $2.3 billion in weapons so far this year alone.The U.S. itself conducts drone warfare in Yemen. The Bush administration began bombing Yemen with drones in 2002, then the Obama administration drastically escalated the pace of the drone campaign in Yemen, and the Trump administration escalated it again. Three times as many strikes occurred in 2017 as in 2016, according to the Pentagon’s data.All of this has been done without an ounce of congressional approval or oversight. The Senate had a chance to end the carnage in March, when a resolution to extricate U.S. forces from Yemen was introduced. Fifty-four senators, including our own Joe Donnelly and nine other Democrats, voted instead to give the Trump administration free rein to continue aiding the ruthless destruction of Yemen.The amendment introduced by Khanna, if passed into law, will be one small step of many that Congress must take to reclaim its war powers and bring the horror show in Yemen to a halt.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'As the second season of \"13 Reasons Why\" premieres May 18 on Netflix, you should strongly consider making this your next binge for the summer. The first season of \"13 Reasons Why\" follows a fictional character, Hannah Baker, who makes 13 audio tapes that discuss the series of events that led to her suicide. The tapes highlight important life issues, such as bullying, sexual assault and mental health that need to be touched upon. Previously, suicide has been considered a taboo choice of conversation. People do not want to talk about it because of the way it brings up uncomfortable circumstances. \"13 Reasons Why\" creates awareness for the topic of suicide, as the show is centered on the suicide of Baker. Another central theme appearing in \"13 Reasons Why\" is the issue of mental health. While mental health has not necessarily been a comfortable thing to discuss, things are beginning to change. Baker is not her usual happy self in the tapes, and suffers from a deep depression. It is important for people to be aware of signs of mental health issues to help others who need it. Spotting the signs early could save a life.The issue of bullying is taken to another level in \"13 Reasons Why.\" Fellow students begin to harass Baker after nude photos of her circulate around her high school. Students abuse her verbally by calling her names and slut-shaming her.The bullying increases when a hot-or-not list comes out with her name listed under hot causing more unwanted sexual harassment, such as a stalker that takes photos of her unknowingly while she is in her bedroom. These incidents cause Baker to feel alone.\"13 Reasons Why\" lets people know bullying has a lasting effect. Bullying must be watched for and prevented to ensure everyone is given the opportunity to feel safe.While you would hope life would get better for Baker, things only get worse when she is raped by a senior. The audio tapes reveal that this event, along with her previous encounters with bullying, led Baker to end her life. Many survivors of sexual assault or abuse suffer silently, so sexual misconduct or sexual abuse are issues that need to be discussed more often. It is important to learn about how to help, so those who have been through that kind of situation are able to receive professional care.Above all, \"13 Reasons Why\" is a great show to demonstrate that the way we interact with people matters and all people should be treated with kindness. In previous times, the first words you would use to comfort people impacted by suicide would be, \"It\\'s not your fault.\" \"13 Reasons Why\" implies that suicide can be due to the way that people are treated. After watching this show and getting educated on sensitive issues, you will be able to make a difference in your own community.  All it takes is one person to create a change. ',\n",

John Kovach said.She then reported to her mother, and later to police, she and the man had had sex without her consent. Kovach said the 16-year-old was reluctant to disclose any information about the man. She was then taken to IU Health Bloomington Hospital for a rape kit and exam.This case is still under investigation. Woman possibly shot while in her apartmentA woman, 32, called 911 on Thursday claiming she had been shot at her 1283 N. Maple Street apartment. According to the police report, the woman initially thought she had received an electric shock. She reported to police she heard a popping sound and then a burning sensation in her arm while sitting down. She had experienced electrical issues in the apartment before, which is why she initially thought she had been shocked. When police investigated and went to her apartment they found two wounds on her left forearm, Kovach said. Though she was not bleeding at the time, she was taken to IU Health Bloomington Hospital.Officers also located holes in the wall and sofa consistent with a small projectile, possibly a bullet. Police obtained a warrant to check out the neighboring apartment where it appeared the the projectile might have come from.No one was home in the next-door apartment when police entered. Officers found a hole consistent with the ones in the first apartment, but no sign of a gun.Police will continue to investigate.\",\n",

       "  'body': \"Daniel Messel, already serving 80 years for the murder of IU student Hannah Wilson, was sentenced to 15 years in prison Tuesday for attacking another student.Messel, 52, originally faced five charges stemming from a night where he allegedly threw a law student to the ground, sexually assaulted her and punched her in the face — hard enough to make her spit blood and knock the contact out of her eye. The woman addressed him in court.“You’ve had power over me for quite some time,” she said. “You don’t have it anymore.”Messel pleaded guilty to an amended charge of felony battery resulting in serious bodily injury. The other charges, including one of rape, were dropped, and the sentence will be served concurrently with the 80-year one from the Wilson murder.Messel interrupted the woman multiple times in court as she spoke. He said he did not want to hear her “fantasy” unrelated to the battery charge.Judge Marc Kellams pointed at Messel and told him to stop interrupting the woman.“I will have you gagged and bound to your chair if I need to,” he said.The student continued to recount the attack and its effects on her.According to court documents, in the early morning of September 1, 2012, Messel drove the then-law student to a wooded area in Monroe County and attempted sexual contact with her while driving. He then pulled her out of the car by her hair and threw her to the gravel ground. He removed her underwear — which police found at the scene later the same day — while she fought him.Messel put his penis into her mouth, according to the document. The woman was able to push him away before he then punched her in the face.Messel left the scene, taking her purse, shoes, phone, credit card and driver's permit with him, according to the document. The student got help from residents at the nearest house who called police, and she was taken to the hospital for a sexual assault examination. DNA from the attacker was found under her fingernails.The woman said in court Tuesday this was something she knew he had done before and would do again.Over two and a half years later, Wilson was found dead April 24, 2015 — three years to the day before Messel’s Tuesday court appearance. In August 2016, Messel was found guilty for the murder of Wilson. The woman from the 2012 attack read testimony from the case and found it “eerily similar” to her own, according to court documents. The DNA found under her fingernails — which was not enough to test in the FBI’s program in 2012 — was tested against Messel’s DNA on file and matched.Robin Wilson, Hannah Wilson’s mother, sat in the courtroom Tuesday. She said she had known about the case since the DNA report and couldn’t believe the sentencing was on the three-year anniversary of Hannah’s death.“That may have all been directed by Hannah,” she told the Indiana Daily Student after the hearing. “She may have wanted it this way.”Robin said she went to the sentencing because she wanted to hear Messel admit guilt to something and to hear that Hannah’s death wasn’t in vain. After the sentencing, Robin and the woman hugged. Wilson said the pair live close to one another and planned to get together.“The best way to honor Hannah’s memory on the anniversary of her death,” Robin said, “was what transpired in that courtroom.”Robin noted even though Messel seemed to struggle in admitting to the battery charge, she said it was good for her to hear him own something.At the beginning of his appearance, when Kellams asked if he understood the charges he was facing, Messel denied some.“I understand the charge,” he said. “I understand it’s not true.”Messel ultimately pleaded guilty to the amended battery charge. The prosecutor said as Messel would already likely be spending the rest of his life in jail from Wilson’s murder, it was more important to the state and woman that Messel took responsibility for his actions.Messel said he had no recollection of the event but was pleading guilty based on the facts presented in the case’s documents. He will serve eight years for the battery charge and seven more for being a habitual offender.When the woman addressed Messel, Robin had tears in her eyes as the woman spoke about the experience. As a first-year law student at the time, she tried to go back to classes but faced questions about her black eye and other injuries. She said she considered dropping out and felt unsafe and damaged.The woman said she still finds herself looking over her shoulder and locking doors in fear of being attacked again. She said she had become the subject of victim blaming.“Daniel Messel, not me, deserves all the blame.”\",\n",

This was slightly higher than last year’s 681 cases, including four more violent crimes reported than last year.Despite the increase in calls, BPD arrested six fewer people this year than last year.“It felt like for the most part everyone was well-behaved,” BPD Capt. Steve Kellams said.He said BPD didn’t have much trouble with the bars and parties seemed smaller this year.IU Police Department Capt. Craig Munroe said his department’s arrests were also lower this year.“We weren’t having to interfere with anyone’s good time — for the most part,” he said.Sexual assault reported at Kilroy’s SportsA 22-year-old woman told officers that, outside of Kilroy’s Sports, a man she didn’t know put his hand up her skirt and grabbed her around 12:30 a.m. Sunday.She reported the man was about 5 feet 6 inches tall, in his early 20s and wearing a black hooded sweatshirt. BPD officers asked Kilroy’s Sports management for video surveillance but said the bar was likely too crowded to see anything on the video.The woman declined to take a sexual assault exam, according to police.Police will continue to investigate the case.Loaded gun, nearly 85 grams of marijuana found in carIUPD officers found a loaded pistol, measuring scales and nearly 85 grams of marijuana after pulling a car over Friday.They pulled over Jayland Payton, 21, of Fishers, Indiana, around 10 p.m. on West Third Street.Officers noticed Payton’s car smelled strongly of marijuana, saw the scales and later found the loaded gun in the glovebox. Payton was not licensed to carry the gun.There was another individual in the car with Payton at the time of his arrest, but they were not charged.Payton is not an IU student. He was charged with dealing marijuana, carrying a gun without a license and possessing marijuana.Man lying in street, peeingIU Health Bloomington Hospital staff called BPD around 5:30 a.m Sunday after seeing a 47-year-old man lying in the street with his genitals out, peeing.Officers tried to help the man out of the road near West First Street and South Fairview Street, but reported he was too drunk to stand.Police said he was clearly drunk and they had to half-carry him to the side of the road.The man was charged with public intoxication and public nudity.Man tries to steal car battery, threatens other man with knifeA man was sleeping in the truck bed of his white Ford F-150 early Sunday morning when he told officers he awoke to someone banging on the truck.He reported seeing a man in his early 30s under the hood of the truck, attempting to remove its battery. He told officers he tapped on the man’s shoulder and asked what he was doing.The man trying to take the battery reportedly said he thought the truck was abandoned. The man who owned the truck told officers his dog then started barking and the other man pulled out a folding knife.He reportedly did not display the knife's blade, but argued with the man who owned the truck briefly before apologizing and leaving.Nothing was stolen.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'Though broken glass and crushed Natural Light beer cans lined Bloomington’s streets Sunday morning, police said the weekend was quiet — for Little 500.Thirty people landed in the Monroe County Correctional Center on Friday, and 28 Saturday. The IU Police Department made a total of 26 arrests from midnight Thursday to Sunday morning.Shooting at partyOne man was shot twice around 2 a.m. Sunday at a party.Police have not located his assailant.Read more about the shooting here.Reported rapeA 44-year-old woman told police she was sexually assaulted Saturday night.BPD Sgt. Ben Burns said she was then uncooperative with police and wouldn’t answer most questions.Police said they will follow up to see whether the woman wants to press charges.Armed robberiesA group of four people told police they were robbed around 2:45 a.m. Saturday near East 17th Street and North Lincoln Street.The group told police two men demanded their wallets and cellphones, and that one of the men was holding a handgun with a laser sight.Police found the stolen property — aside from the cash in the wallets — a short distance from the alleged location of the robbery.Three of the four people who reported being robbed were 21 and the fourth was 22. Three were men.Around the same time Saturday morning, a Pizza X delivery driver told police he was stopped by a man with a gun, who demanded all of the cash he was carrying.This incident happened at East 15th Street and North Lincoln Avenue, just two blocks from the first robbery.The delivery driver told officers he was leaving a house where he had just dropped a pizza off when the man approached him.He reported turning his pockets inside out to prove he didn’t have any cash on him.Bloomington Police Department Sgt. Dana Cole said the driver thought sirens from officers responding to the other robbery scared the man, causing him to run.Cole said BPD does not know whether the robberies were related.No arrests have been made in relation to these cases. They are under investigation.Shots firedA drunk man tried to enter an apartment that wasn’t his around 1:30 a.m. Saturday, causing one of the men living in the apartment to fire two rounds from his gun.No one was injured, but police heard the gunshots on Hoosier Court and went to investigate.The men living in the apartment told police an unknown drunk man was banging on their front door, so one of the men opened it. They reported the man then tried to force his way in the apartment.The drunk man was later identified as Damian Wood, 24.A struggle between Wood and one of the roommates ensued, and the other roommate leaned out of his third story window and began firing his handgun near the front door.The fight then moved inside, according to police, and the roommate with the gun went to the top of the stairs and yelled that he was willing to defend himself.Wood reportedly ran out of the house, and he was arrested a short distance away. He was charged with residential entry, battery and public intoxication.Police confiscated the gun, a 9mm Ruger semi-automatic handgun.Wood reportedly did not want to speak with officers.Taco Bell fightOfficers arrested two men fighting in the North Walnut Street Taco Bell parking lot around 2 a.m. Friday.Police stopped at a red light noticed the men punching each other in the parking lot.They said the men did not stop fighting as officers approached and identified themselves as police. The men instead reportedly fell to the ground and continued to swing at one another.Cristian Fairley, 21, was arrested on charges of resisting law enforcement and disorderly conduct after struggling against officers who were trying to break up the fight.Landon Flaniken,  21, was only charged with disorderly conduct.4/20-themed arrestsThe Friday of Little 500 weekend was also April 20, a day internationally recognized for its connection to marijuana culture.At 4:20 p.m. Friday, a cheer rose around campus. Eight of Friday’s arrests were marijuana-related.Liquor bottles fall on families eating ice creamAbout 15 people eating ice cream outside at the Chocolate Moose on South Walnut Street told police empty glass liquor bottles began falling around them around 2:30 p.m. Saturday.Police said the families jumped up and left the outdoor seating area when bottles began shattering at their feet. No one was injured.Three Urban Station Apartments balconies are directly above the seating area.Officers asked residents of several apartments above the seating area whether they dropped or threw the bottles, but everyone declined involvement with the incident.Police are requesting surveillance footage from surrounding businesses to determine how the bottles fell.',\n",

       "  'body': \"Get out of town for Little 500Every year since 1951, it has been a tradition for thousands of people to gather around a track that is too small to watch bikers race. Some attendees do not know anyone in the race, but this tradition draws in thousands of viewers.Freshmen who know nothing of the history of the Little 500 race go to just get a taste of what it is like to be at IU. Students from other universities often come to experience the IU party scene and the race. Likewise, many students here simply use the entire week as an excuse to party.But I think we don't need to succumb to the pressure of others just to attend a hot, crowded event which most people don't watch.I think this weekend should be a getaway — an escape, if you will — from the mayhem that comes from this race. It may be an escape for safety from the higher levels of danger, which may come from the increased number of people drinking on campus.It may be an escape for peace of mind just before finals.This escape could lead to a more productive dead week, especially because you wouldn't have to suffer from a hangover Monday. Or this getaway may just be an escape to be with friends — just like Little 500 is supposed to be.You can pass time with the friends doing things that are just as much fun as this race seems to advertise. Little 500 weekend all in itself ought to be seen as a vacation weekend spent however you want it to be spent. But I am saying that no one ought to be pressured into the participation of the races themselves. Get out of here and enjoy yourselves. Bars shouldn't charge cover on Little 500 weekendWhen college students think of Little 500, most of them think about partying first and racing second. Despite the weekend being dedicated to the race aspect of the event, the weeklong drinking festival that comes before the races is what is remembered the most — that is, if you remember any of it.From house parties and day parties to the bars and tailgating before the races, many people will be finding a way to drink this weekend.Because of this, I think it would be great to see Bloomington take advantage of this phenomenon and find a way to give discounts to those who partake in Little 500 activities.For example, the bars on Kirkwood Avenue and the Courthouse Square will certainly profit off IU students, and their families or friends from out of town. Even if all bars were to give a small discount on drinks throughout the weekend, I believe they would see an increase in sales. Not only are the bars intimidating because of the mass gathering of people, but with most of the festivities happening between Thursday and Sunday — when drink prices are usually not discounted — students are reluctant to go to the bars and stick to parties instead.And while bars may not be the safest places during Little 500, they still offer some protection that house parties do not, such as knowing what you are drinking.Because of this, I think bars should lower drink prices throughout Little 500.  Little 500 is as fun as you make itLittle 500 is referred to as the greatest college weekend in America, and I wouldn’t have any problems with this description if it weren’t for the fact that it seems almost everyone on campus loses their minds.  There are plenty of great things about Little 500. The riders’ dedication to their sport is impressive, the fans’ enthusiasm is exciting and the races raise a lot of money for student scholarships. But surrounding all of those wonderful things is an aura of crazy which I just can’t get behind. This is not to say I don’t like going out with friends during Little 500. I love a good house party as long as things don’t get out of hand. However, things getting out of hand seems to be the inevitable result of Little 500 festivities. Because of this, I can’t help but wish we’d all focus a little more on truly keeping up a culture of care than on pushing every possible limit. Plenty of students are uncomfortable with the atmosphere in Bloomington during race weekend, and with good reason. It’s hard to feel at ease when you’re surrounded by party culture in its most intense form. For all of our sakes, even those who aren't bothered by the hysteria, I fully believe we could all enjoy ourselves more if we scaled back just a little bit and took better care of each other.Actually expecting college kids to commit to these limits probably sounds completely naive, and I’ll admit that it is very unlikely. It’s not impossible, though, and we would all be better off and able to enjoy the weekend.Go sober for this year's Little 500 weekend Excessive alcohol use kills approximately 88,000 people in the United States each year, and U.S. consumers spend roughly $249 billion per year. A recent study published in the journal The Lancet showed consuming more than one drink each day, or more than 100 grams of alcohol a week, increases your risk of death from fatal hypertensive disease, aortic aneurysm, heart failure and stroke. Consume more than 200 grams of alcohol per week and your life expectancy begins to drop significantly, potentially by more than a year. One scientist on the study said the health risks of consuming alcohol over the 100 gram limit was, for a 40-year-old, comparable to those of smoking. I support the Little 500 race as an important philanthropic event and I greatly appreciate the athleticism and camaraderie of the IU cycling community. Since the first race in 1951, the IU Student Foundation has given more than $2 million in scholarships to undergraduates.  But I cannot support the culture of alcoholism the race weekend perpetuates. According to National Institutes of Health research, each year, around 696,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 report assault by another student who has been drinking, and around 97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 report experiencing alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape.Alcohol industry groups have also been accused of obfuscating or downright denying the links between alcohol consumption — even in moderate amounts — and cancers such as breast and esophageal cancers. The lives of thousands of infants are also affected each year due to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The American Academy of Pediatrics says no quantity of alcohol consumption during pregnancy should be considered safe, and recent research has shown that even before conception, maternal and paternal alcohol consumption can have negative effects on fetal health. There are other ways to have fun and be social this weekend, IU. Don't rely on alcohol to have a good time.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'The New York Times and the New Yorker recently won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for public service for their reports on sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein in Hollywood. These organizations deserve this award more than anyone else.  The Pulitzer Prize is the highest honor in journalism and the New York Times and the New Yorker\\'s win this year is extremely well deserved.The investigations on Weinstein sparked the #MeToo movement, where people stepped forward about their experiences with sexual assault in an unprecedented way. Over 100 people came forward to speak out against Weinstein alone.The New York Times’ team was led by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey while the New Yorker’s contributions were led by Ronan Farrow. The Pulitzer Prize Board said that these journalists received the awards “for explosive, impactful journalism that exposed wealthy and powerful sexual predators including allegations against one of Hollywood’s most influential producers, bringing them to account for long-suppressed allegations of coercion, brutality and victim silencing, thus spurring a worldwide reckoning about sexual abuse of women.”Kantor and Twohey first reported about Weinstein in the New York Times in October 2017, revealing he had been paying off sexual harassment accusers for decades.They followed up their investigation in December, joined by Susan Dominus, Jim Rutenberg and Steve Eder, with an examination of the people and systems that enabled Weinstein’s abuse.Journalists at the New York Times continued their pursuit in exposing the abuses of men in power, following up with investigations about Vice Media, comedian Louis C.K. and restaurateur Ken Friedman.Farrow’s first piece in the New Yorker, a 7,000 word investigation first disclosing Weinstein’s accusations, was published five days after the New York Times article. Farrow went on to reveal additional assault allegations in subsequent articles, along with Weinstein’s use of private investigation firms.  He also exposed money from Weinstein’s settlements came from his brother\\'s, Bob Weinstein\\'s, personal account.As the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, Ronan Farrow has stated his family background made him understand abuse from an early age.“You see early in life with that kind of a family background the way in which the most powerful men in America wield power for good and for ill,\" he said to The Hollywood Reporter.These investigations led to thousands of people coming forward to talk about their experiences of sexual abuse, bringing down many powerful men whose actions had been covered up for years.The investigations sparked a change in the way sexual abuse is discussed and paved the way for a future in which powerful people may no longer get away with their terrible actions. Kantor, Twohey, and Farrow deserve this honor for pioneering such an important moment in journalism and public service.',\n",

She was transported to the emergency room.This case remains under investigation.In an unrelated incident, a different woman came to the Bloomington Police Department on Saturday evening to report a prior sexual assault.The 19-year-old woman told police she was assaulted by a friend who does not live in Bloomington in late October. She reported waking up to him two nights in a row as he vaginally assaulted her with his hands.She is not pursuing charges, according to police.Man who barricaded himself in room charged with neglectBloomington man Justin Brown, 29, was arrested Saturday evening after allegedly punching a man and barricading himself in a room to escape police.A man was at Broadview Park with his daughter when he reported seeing Brown apparently drunk and asking children to get in his car.Police later determined the children, 2 and 6 years old, were Brown’s. The man who called the police reported he told Brown he shouldn’t be around children when he is drunk. Brown then allegedly punched the man in the face and pushed over the motor scooter where the other man’s 7-year-old daughter sat, causing her to fall and scrape her knee.Brown then left in his car with his two children. Officers found him with his kids barricaded in the bedroom of a house where he did not live.He was reportedly uncooperative with police and refused to let go of his kids as officers broke into the room. The door hit the man's daughter when police burst in, which officers said would not have happened if the man cooperated.Brown is charged with battery, aggravated battery, neglect of a dependent, resisting law enforcement, criminal mischief and driving while suspended.He has been charged before — twice with drunken driving, twice with domestic battery and once with battery.Attempted truck theft causes damageAn attempt to hot-wire a Chevrolet pickup resulted in damage to the truck’s steering column and ignition, police said.The truck’s owner reported the truck was parked outside of an apartment on South Basswood Drive when someone tried to steal it.\",\n",
